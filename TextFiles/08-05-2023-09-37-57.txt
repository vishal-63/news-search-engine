2023-05-07 22:10:00
After a wild week full of production changes for the MTV Movie & TV Awards amid the writers’ strike, a motley crew of stars received golden popcorn statuettes on Sunday.Blockbuster film “Top Gun: Maverick” joined TV shows “Stranger Things,” “The Last of Us,” “The White Lotus” and “Wednesday” with the most nominations among the scripted content. Leading the nominations in the unscripted categories were shows such as “Jersey Shore Family Vacation,” “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and “Vanderpump Rules.” Jennifer Coolidge received the Comic Genius Award, while the best musical moment award went to Purple Hearts for “Come Back Home.”The annual ceremony was originally supposed to be hosted by Drew Barrymore, but Barrymore announced on Thursday that she’ll be stepping down from hosting in a show of support for the ongoing writers’ strike. While some of Barrymore’s bits had already been taped prior to the strike commencing, the ceremony went on without a formal host. In a statement, Barrymore vowed to return as host for the 2024 show.Following reports that striking members of the Writers Guild of America planned to picket at the Santa Monica Barker Hangar, where the event is being filmed, executive producer Bruce Gillmer shared in a statement to CNN that the MTV Movie & TV Awards were “pivoting away from a live event” by airing a pre-taped version of the ceremony on Sunday instead.Part of that pivot during the telecast included flashback clips from previous MTV Movie & TV Awards shows, which constituted an overwhelming majority of the show, along with pre-taped speeches from winners.A full list of nominees follows below, with the winners indicated in bold.BEST MOVIE“Avatar: The Way of Water”“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”“Elvis”“Nope”“Scream VI” *WINNER“Smile”“Top Gun: Maverick”BEST SHOW“Stranger Things”“The Last of Us” *WINNER“The White Lotus”“Wednesday”“Wolf Pack”“Yellowstone”“Yellowjackets”BEST PERFORMANCE IN A MOVIEAustin Butler — “Elvis”Florence Pugh — “Don’t Worry Darling:KeKe Palmer — “Nope”Michael B.
