The pizza slice is Italian. Fries are Belgian or Dutch. Hamburgers and frankfurters? Likely German. But in the kitchens of the United States, they have been improved and added to – becoming global icons for food lovers everywhere.And don’t neglect the homegrown American dishes either.

Impossible to eat.Street eats are a Thai attraction. Flip through a Thai cook book, and you’ll be hard pressed to find an ingredient list that doesn’t run a page long.The combination of so many herbs and spices in each dish produces complex flavors that somehow come together like orchestral music.

The best part about eating Thai food in Thailand, though, is the hospitality. Sun, beach, service with a smile and a plastic bag full of som tam – that’s the good life.YumTom yam kung: a rave party for the mouth. The floral notes of lemongrass, the earthy galangal, freshness of kaffir lime leaves and the heat of the chilies.Massaman curry: a Thai curry with Islamic roots.Som tam: The popular green papaya salad is sour, extra spicy, sweet and salty.
