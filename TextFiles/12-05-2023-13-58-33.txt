A life-sized chocolate bust of Britain’s King Charles III weighing 23 kilograms (more than 50 pounds) has been unveiled by confectionery brand Celebrations to mark the forthcoming coronation.A team of sculptors and chocolatiers led by master chocolatier Jennifer Lindsey-Clarke took 130 hours across four weeks to make the model, using more than 17 liters (4.5 gallons) of melted chocolate, Celebrations said in a press release on Wednesday. This is equivalent to about 2,875 individual Celebrations chocolates.The ornamental shoulder pieces decorating the King’s uniform were modeled from individual Twix, Milky Way, Galaxy and Bounty chocolates, with the King’s collar made from Maltesers Teasers.One of each of the Celebrations chocolates, including Snickers, was used to create the medals on his chest.“What better way to celebrate this moment in British history than immortalising HM King Charles III using the nation’s ultimate sharing treat,” said Emily Owen, a senior brand manager at Celebrations, in the release, adding that the team are “delighted with how he looks.”“The team studied hours of footage of the King to capture his true likeness and the resemblance is uncanny. Celebrations is all about bringing people together and we are thrilled to be sharing this occasion with so many chocolate lovers up and down the country,” she added.The chocolate bust will be on display in the southeastern English town of Slough at Mars Wrigley UK HQ, the headquarters of Mars, which owns the Celebrations brand. King Charles III’s coronation will take place on May 6 in London’s Westminster Abbey.
