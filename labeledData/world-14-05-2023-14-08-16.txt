The region could see rainfall rates as high as 2 to 3 inches per hour at times.Forecast models are indicating as much as 3 to 7 inches of rain are possible through Wednesday, with some areas potentially getting as much as 10 inches.“The probability for numerous significant flash floods events has increased,” the National Weather Service in Houston said. “There is an increased danger to lives and property due to flash flooding.”The main concern will be for areas where storms begin to train, which occurs when storms roll over the same area for longer periods of time, leading to intense flash flooding.Get your local forecast hereThe prediction center also issued a broader area of excessive rainfall risk for much of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.
