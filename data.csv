For this last 5%, the ‘Red Army’ [the Russian Armed Forces] are not playing any role,” Prigozhin said.“We don’t have the necessary ammunition, and no one has communicated with us about getting back to full capacity,” Prigozhin said.“It is better to save our army than to win a battle.”The announcement by Prigozhin – sometimes dubbed “Putin’s chef” because his catering companies provided services for the Kremlin – follows the release last week of expletive-laden video footage in which he challenged Russia’s military leadership and blamed defense chiefs for “tens of thousands” of Wagner casualties.Prigozhin, whose Wagner mercenary group has taken on a growing role in the Ukraine conflict as Russian forces falter, has been highly visible on the front lines in recent months – where he has claimed credit for territorial gains, particularly in the battles raging around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.But as Prigozhin’s stature has increased, so too have his clashes with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the Russian armed forces Gen. Valery Gerasimov, prompting speculation about possible elite infighting in Moscow as Russia’s military campaign fails to advance.In February, Prigozhin accused the two men of “treason” for their alleged failures to support and supply the Wagner group in Ukraine.His most recent challenge to Russian defense officials comes as Bakhmut remains heavily contested.In his Telegram message Saturday, Prigozhin said Wagner’s role in Bakhmut had been to grind down Ukrainian forces while allowing Russian forces to regroup.“On October 8, 2022, together with the Army General Sergei Surovikin, it was decided to launch the operation ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’ – an assault on the village of Bakhmut in order to provoke (Ukrainian President) Vladimir Zelensky to throw in as many forces as possible to hold Bakhmut. In Bakhmut, we grinded (the Ukrainian forces), hence the name – ‘Bakhmut meat grinder,’” Prigozhin said.“The purpose of the operation ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’ was to enable the units of the Russian army to take advantageous lines of defense, mobilize, re-equip, train personnel and increase their combat potential,” he added.“With regards to the Bakhmut meat grinder, there will be no more meat grinder because there’s nothing left to grind the meat with,” Prigozhin said.Prigozhin’s message came as the notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov called on Wagner fighters to join forces with his Akhmat battalion in Bakhmut.“The Wagner (company) has very good, courageous, necessary, necessary people, necessary to us, because they know the area,” Kadyrov said in a video message on Saturday.“If you stay with us, I promise you that we will give you more, create better conditions, than you have today. We will try to make everything top notch for you,” said Kadyrov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.“You (Wagner fighters) know our commanders. You can contact them – any group, the number does not matter,” the Chechen leader noted.Kadyrov also posted an image of his letter to Putin “to issue combat orders on the removal of Akhmat units from other directions in order to hand Wagner positions in Bakhmut over to them.”",world,0.0

Hurricanes and tropical storms have a devastating effect on lives and livelihoods, so we’re immensely proud to be entrusted by NASA to launch the TROPICS missions which will enable scientists and researchers to accurately predict storm strength and give people time to evacuate and make plans,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck in a statement. “With the 2023 hurricane season fast approaching, time is of the essence for these missions.”Each CubeSat will orbit at about 340 miles (550 kilometers) above Earth’s surface and capture hourly observations of the precipitation, temperature and humidity of tropical storms. Current satellites take similar data, but only about every six hours, which makes it more difficult to measure the intensity of storms.More frequent data can help scientists understand the rapid changes that can occur within a storm, impacting its structure and stability, and help meteorologists improve their prediction and forecasting models.During the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, there were so many tropical storms and hurricanes that meteorologists ran out of names on the predefined list and had to switch to the Greek alphabet — and then the same thing happened again in 2021, said Ben Kim, program executive at NASA’s Earth Science Division.In 2022, three hurricanes hit the US, but Hurricane Ian alone caused more than $100 billion in damages and caused more than 100 fatalities, Kim said.“TROPICS aims to improve our scientific understanding by obtaining microwave observations that allow us to see the inner structure of the storm approximately hourly,” Kim said. “These observations will complement existing weather satellites and ultimately then can be tied to the broader understanding of the entire Earth system.”Data collected by TROPICS will be shared with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the National Hurricane Center and other partners. The satellites will measure water vapor primarily located in the troposphere, or the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere, where most weather phenomena occurs.“The exciting thing about this is its the ability to see inside the storms, but it’s also the ability to see how the storms are changing over short periods of time,” said Dr. Will McCarty, program scientist at NASA’s Earth Science Division.",world,0.0
2,2,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/europe/prigozhin-wagner-bakhmut-russia-support-intl/index.html,Wagner boss suggests his forces may stay in Bakhmut after threatening to withdraw,2023-05-07 18:39:00,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner mercenary group, has apparently backtracked on a threat to withdraw his forces from the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, after Russia’s Ministry of Defense promised to provide more ammunition to his troops.In an explosive, expletive-laden rant this week, Prigozhin appeared in front of dozens of his dead soldiers and blamed Russia’s military leadership for “tens of thousands” of Wagner casualties. He declared that his men would leave Bakhmut by May 10 because of inadequate supplies, resulting in heavy losses.But a new audio message posted Sunday on Telegram suggests he has changed his mind after concessions from the Russian government.“The bottom line is the following: they promise to give us ammunition and weapons, as much as we need to continue further actions. They swear to us that everything that is necessary will be on the flank so the enemy сan’t cut us off. We are told that we can act in Bakhmut as we see fit,” Prigozhin said.The Russian Ministry of Defense did not immediately comment on Prigozhin’s latest claim.Bakhmut has been the site of a months-long assault by Russian forces that has driven thousands from their homes and left the area devastated. But, despite the vast amounts of manpower and resources Russia has poured into capturing Bakhmut, they have not been able to take total control of the city.“We’ve taken 95% of Bakhmut. For this last 5%, the ‘Red Army’ [the Russian Armed Forces] are not playing any role,” Prigozhin said in a message posted on his official Telegram channel Saturday.Prigozhin’s blunt and brutal tactics in Bakhmut have long been likened to a “meat grinder.” But, in his repeated threats to withdraw from Bakhmut, Prigozhin claimed this approach was no longer viable.“There will be no more meat grinder because there’s nothing left to grind the meat with,” Prigozhin said.The Wagner boss had said Wagner positions in and around Bakhmut would be transferred to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov’s forces from May 10.But Prigozhin’s latest message posted Sunday revealed that Russia’s Ministry of Defense had pledged significant support to the Wagner group, including allowing general Sergey Surovikin, the former overall commander of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to help organize Wagner’s operations.“They give us Surovikin as a person who will make all decisions in the framework of the military operations of PMC Wagner and interact with the Ministry of Defense,” Prigozhin said.Prigozhin had also previously floated the possibility that Wagner might be disbanded without greater support from the Russian government, but appeared to also row back from these suggestions in the new audio message.“I specifically asked a question to all junior commanders, who immediately brought it to the attention of the fighters: if someone wants, they can go to other military formations. Everyone unequivocally answered ‘No.’”",world,0.0

In the background, the Choir of Westminster Abbey sang the anthemic “Zadok the Priest” by George Frideric Handel, which was composed for the coronation of King George II in 1727 and performed at every British coronation since.Once he re-emerged, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St. Edward’s Crown upon Charles III’s head. It was the only time Charles will ever wear St. Edward’s Crown, which is reserved for the coronation of a new monarch; the crown was made for the new King’s namesake, Charles II, in 1661.After crowning Charles, Welby shouted: “God Save the King.” Those in attendance repeated the words.Soon after, Camilla was also crowned. Like her husband, she was anointed with holy oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury – this time in full view of the audience – before having Queen Mary’s Crown placed on her head.Music underpinned the entire celebration, in keeping with history. Each stage was marked by either a grand choral work, an ethereal motet, an extravagant organ composition or an evocative melody, all performed by some of the most accomplished singers and musicians in the world.King Charles and Queen Camilla entered the abbey to the strains of “I was glad,” the stirring coronation anthem written by Hubert Parry for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 and sung at all coronations since then.But the old was blended with the new; Charles had asked Andrew Lloyd Webber – whose music is more familiar to audiences in the West End than congregations in Westminster Abbey – to write a Coronation Anthem, “Make a Joyful Noise,” which played after Camilla was enthroned.And this event featured the first ever appearance by a gospel choir at a coronation; dressed in resplendent white, the Ascension Choir performed ‘Alleluia’ just before the Archbishop’s sermon.Thousands of people had packed into Westminster Abbey.Decked in a teal cape and cap with gold detailing, a woman in blue commanded attention as she wielded an important object of the coronation regalia – the Sword of Offering or the Jewelled Sword, before and after the investiture, when it was used. But who is she?Penny Mordaunt is a Conservative lawmaker in the United Kingdom, and has been since 2010.She was involved in the ceremony because, as the current Leader of the House of Commons, she is also the Lord President of the Privy Council – a body formed of senior politicians who act as the monarch’s official advisers.The council’s president is involved in a variety of royal ceremonies, acting as a symbolic bridge between the King or Queen and the country’s elected officials. Mordaunt spoke at the Proclamation of King Charles, two days after the Queen’s death.Queen Camilla was a regal sight in ivory, silver and gold. But who was she wearing?Unsurprisingly, it was a British designer, Bruce Oldfield, who she has a longstanding relationship with.Simple, tailored and cut from Peau de Soie, a silk fabric with a dull luster finish, her coronation dress was more akin to a coat dress with an embroidered underskirt as opposed to a traditional dress.Arriving at Westminster Abbey before the service, her dress was protected by the crimson velvet and ermine Robe of State that was originally made for Queen Elizabeth’s coronation.Peeping out beneath her dress were shoes in the same silk as her clothing, made by British designer Elliot Zed.Never one to disappoint at royal events, Prince Louis, the youngest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, again stole the show during segments of the coronation ceremony.Keen-eyed viewers may have noticed the 5-year-old yawning, sitting between his mother, the Princess of Wales, and sister Princess Charlotte, but then pulling a disappearing act from the service.It was thought the young royal might leave early, but luckily for fans, he returned before the end of the service.For those who don’t remember, Louis gained global infamy during the late Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June, where he was captured throwing a tantrum and covering his ears while screaming during the flypast.Meanwhile, there was widespread speculation before Saturday as to whether Prince Harry would be at his father’s coronation.The Duke of Sussex attended the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, sitting in the third row.Wearing a morning suit with his military medals, Harry arrived alongside his uncles, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, and two of his cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.Prince Harry attended without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who reportedly stayed back in the US with their children on the account of Archie’s fourth birthday.The coronation marked the first time the prince publicly met members of his family since the release of his memoir, “Spare.”After it ended, he was seen talking and smiling with his cousins amidst a downpour, before he took a car on his own.He did not appear with members of the royal family to greet the public from the balcony of Buckingham Palace on Saturday afternoon – a flagship part of royal events.CNN understands that Prince Harry did not receive an invitation to join the family for this balcony moment, which featured a slimmed-down flypast by the Royal Air Force. Prince Andrew wasn’t present either.The weather did not favor King Charles – and while crowds seemed unperturbed by the rain, it did alter plans for the traditional Royal Air Force flypast.The display was formed only of helicopters and the colorful Red Arrows, and not the expected Typhoons, Spitfires, Hurricanes and Lancaster bombers.But crowds instead enjoyed not one but two appearances on the balcony by the new King and Queen, who provided an encore after seemingly waving goodbye to supporters.That wrapped up an eventful day, which had drawn thousands onto London’s streets.",style,0.0

6,6,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/uk/suella-braverman-profile-migration-gbr-intl/index.html,"‘A Trump tribute act’: Meet Suella Braverman, the commander-in-chief of Britain’s culture wars",2023-05-07 23:50:00,"Late last year, after a breakneck ascent of British politics put her in charge of the country’s migration, crime and national security agenda, Suella Braverman revealed her political fantasy.“I would love to (see) a front page of The Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda,” the home secretary (interior minister) told that newspaper, referring to her controversial efforts to deport asylum-seekers to the central African nation. “That’s my dream. That’s my obsession.”Braverman is no stranger to the front pages. Her self-proclaimed “obsession” with curbing migration – and the loaded and occasionally inflammatory language she uses to address it – has attracted forceful criticism from international agencies, lawyers, rights groups and many of her own colleagues, making her arguably Britain’s most divisive politician.But among Conservative Party members and the chief architects of Brexit, she is a star; someone who is prepared to say and do controversial things in pursuit of a singular goal.“She’s the cutting edge of the populist, radical right-wing strain in the Conservative Party,” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London, and the author of books on the party, told CNN.“In a way, that allows her to say what some Conservative MPs would think of as the unsayable.”Braverman has railed against what she calls an “invasion” of migrants, holding “values which are at odds with our country” – and suggested she would break international law to deport them from Britain.And she is an equally furious culture warrior, borrowing rhetoric from the American right when lambasting “woke” culture, transgender rights and climate protesters.“She’s recognized that in the current political climate, her way of creating an impact… (is) positioning herself as a Trump tribute act,” migration policy expert and campaigner Zoe Gardner told CNN.But Braverman has speedily made herself a central figure in British politics; the assassin of Liz Truss’s premiership and the kingmaker of Rishi Sunak’s, she has made evident her desire to ultimately enter Downing Street as prime minister herself – a prospect that sits uneasily with much of the country’s political establishment.Braverman, who evangelizes on the benefits of Brexit and has made migration curbs her political mission, has a backstory that seems to teem with contradictions.She is the daughter of migrants, who wants to cut net migration to Britain to the “tens of thousands.” Her parents, both of Indian origin, arrived in the country from Kenya and Mauritius “with very little” in the 1960s.She was a practicing lawyer before entering politics, but has displayed an unabashed indifference about whether her flagship migration bill complies with international law.And she is an avid Francophile, sometimes speaking in French when meeting her counterpart in Paris, who championed the project to leave the European Union. Braverman says she fell in love with France while studying at the renowned Sorbonne university in Paris, taking advantage of the EU’s Erasmus program that encourages students to spend time in other parts of the continent. Brexit shut the program off to British students.Now, she has staked her political reputation on her ability to “Stop the Boats” – an oft-repeated government pledge, borrowed from Australia’s hardline rhetoric towards asylum-seekers, to reduce the growing number of migrants crossing the English Channel on small vessels.It is a stance that has drawn sharp criticism – including from within the traditional wing of Braverman’s Conservative Party.“Braverman has placed far too much emphasis on curbing migration,” said Ben Ramanauskas, an economist and adviser to Truss when the previous prime minister was secretary of state for international trade. “Her priority seems to be attempting to be as cruel as possible.”The government’s flagship bill, which was approved by MPs last week but faces scrutiny in the House of Lords, essentially hands the government the right to deport anyone arriving illegally in the United Kingdom. “It’s incredibly dangerous, hostile, cruel, and fundamentally unworkable,” Gardner  said.And experts say it deliberately misses the point. “Deterrents don’t work… There is absolutely no correlation whatsoever between how brutally we respond to migration, and the numbers of people forced to move,” Gardner said. “We need a functioning asylum system where we process people’s claims, (and) we need to give people safe routes in order to travel.”Braverman, however, is steadfast in the face of criticism. The Home Office told CNN in a statement that her bill “will break the business model of the people smuggling gangs and restore fairness to our asylum system. It will ensure anyone arriving via small boat or other dangerous and illegal means will be in scope for detention and swiftly removed.”Braverman’s plans have won praise from Europe’s leading populist figures, including Italy’s hardline deputy leader Matteo Salvini and French far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.But that is company many in the Conservatives feel uncomfortable keeping.“The UK’s ability to play a role internationally is based on our reputation – not because we’re British, but because of what we stand for and what we do,” ex-Prime Minister Theresa May said in a stinging intervention in the House of Commons last month. May added last week that the bill’s removal of modern slavery protections “will consign victims to remaining in slavery.”And Sayeeda Warsi, the first Asian chair of the Tory party, has attacked what she described as Braverman’s “racist rhetoric,” after Braverman prompted controversy by singling out British Pakistani men when attacking grooming gangs in the country.“Braverman’s own ethnic origin has shielded her from criticism for too long,” Warsi wrote in The Guardian. “Black and brown people can be racist too.” The Home Office told CNN that Braverman “has been clear that all despicable child abusers must be brought to justice. And she will not shy away from telling hard truths, particularly when it comes to the grooming of young women and girls in Britain’s towns who have been failed by authorities over decades.”Braverman fronts a newer, more populist streak in the UK’s ruling party – a move that has troubled some of its grandees but has found an audience among voters.“The voters that she’s appealing to is the majority of the British public,” said James Johnson, who ran polling in May’s Downing Street operation and later founded the JL Partners pollster. “There is a very significant disconnect between what people on Twitter about immigration, and what people actually think about immigration.“Voters do not react to (Braverman’s) language with the same outrage that some people do,” he told CNN. “(They) want their politicians to at least be trying.”Polling shows that approval of Braverman’s tough stance on migration significantly outpaces support for the government in general – as well as approval of Braverman herself – with research often indicating that a slim majority of the public supports her plans.And those who support her – particularly those in Euroskeptic circles, where she is almost revered – say Braverman speaks to the concerns of modern Britain in a way that her more seasoned critics cannot. “When finally even I wobbled about backing Brexit in name only, Suella stood firm,” prominent Brexit backer Steve Baker said when he supported her leadership campaign last year, praising Braverman’s resolve to defeat May’s Brexit deal and push for a harder-line departure from the EU. “It wouldn’t have happened without her.”But research has also shown that the importance of immigration to British voters has receded since the bitter debates of the mid-2010s.It appears inevitable that the Tories will seek to make migration a wedge issue at the next election, ensuring Braverman plenty of airtime as the government looks to draw a contrast between itself and the Labour party. But a series of brutal electoral results in local polls on Thursday will further fuel questions about whether that is a winning strategy.Braverman’s political coming-of-age took place just as the 2016 EU referendum shifted the tectonic plates underneath Westminster, giving younger, Euroskeptic voices like hers an inroad with the public.It was Braverman’s role fronting an anti-EU backbench committee that “propelled her to her (current) position, and she knows it,” former Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach told CNN.Today, she takes the populist mantle further than many of her peers on a range of matters far beyond Brexit. Braverman appears to relish “culture war” confrontations with her political enemies like few other frontline politicians; “you almost feel sometimes that she gets a kick out of ‘owning the libs,’” the politics professor Bale told CNN.She has taken aim at the “Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati” from the despatch box, and insisted she will “not be hectored by out-of-touch lefties.” In 2019, she said she considers herself engaged in a “battle against cultural Marxism.”Braverman’s Home Office recently reportedly backed two pub landlords who refused to remove their minstrel-style children’s toys that are considered a racist relic of the 1970s. And she has criticized police officers for “virtue signaling,” saying in a speech last week that “they shouldn’t be taking the knee.”But those battles have left some traditional Tories cold. “The Conservative Party has moved right since I joined, and become much more like the MAGA Republicans” since the dividing line of 2016, said Sandbach, who was expelled from the party by Boris Johnson after trying to avert a no-deal Brexit. She subsequently joined the Liberal Democrats.Those who worked alongside Braverman describe her as friendly and personable, and few doubt her ambition.As 23-year-old Suella Fernandes, she nearly ran against her own mother to become the Tory candidate in a 2003 by-election, until the elder Fernandes – a Conservative councilor and NHS nurse – persuaded her to pull out.Braverman succeeded in becoming an MP in 2015. In a series of tweets that bemoaned her “lamentable hopelessness,” one of her more critical backbenchers, William Wragg, claimed she asked in her first week in Parliament whether she could expense a fine for speeding.But her determination to drive towards power has served her well. No politician emerged more triumphant from the psychodrama that has transfixed British politics than Braverman, who started 2022 as attorney general and ended it a household name – having served in three different Cabinets, twice as home secretary.An initial departure from frontline politics theoretically came amid scandal (Braverman resigned for breaching ministerial rules by using a private email address), but her scathing parting letter turned her misconduct into a maneuver, essentially pulling the plug on Truss’s shambolic tenure.“I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility: I resign,” Braverman wrote, in a thinly veiled attempt to contrast herself with Truss. Six days later she was back in the same post, having aligned herself with Sunak’s successful leadership bid.Few doubt Braverman’s long-term ambitions. “You have to interpret everything Suella Braverman does and says in the light of the leadership contest that many people assume will take place if… Sunak were to lose the next election,” Bale said.Crucial to that target is her reputation among party members and its more hardline MPs. It is those groups that pick a party leader, and she is met enthusiastically by grassroots Conservatives who tend to reflect the more right-wing, populist traits of the bloc.That prospect undoubtedly perturbs some. “There will be many Tory MPs who simply could not stomach her as leader,” Bale added. “I think the lack of support she received in her leadership bid (last year) reflects how she was seen by the party as a whole,” Sandbach said.Nevertheless, Braverman is storming up the approval rankings among ordinary Conservative members. In its latest monthly league table of Cabinet ministers, the ConservativeHome website – widely regarded as having its finger on the pulse of the grassroots party – puts Braverman fourth from the top with a net approval rating of 47.8. Only last November, she was sixth from bottom in the site’s regular survey of party members. “The panel seems to have decided that if the Government fails to stop the boats it won’t be for want of the Home Secretary trying,” wrote the website’s editors in April.Should Braverman succeed at her next bid for the party leadership, her critics fear another rightwards shift in British politics.“Braverman has taken some cues from the US, and also from history,” Gardner said.“She’s setting herself up to lead a more extreme, right-wing populist version of the Tory party.”",politics,0.0

Its purpose is to promote closer political, economic, cultural and social relations among the members.Member states agreed during Sunday’s meeting to “resume the participation of the delegations of the government of the Syrian Arab Republic in the meetings of the Council of the League of Arab States,” according to an Arab League statement.The Arab League also stressed the need to take “practical and effective steps” to resolve the Syrian crisis,  the statement added.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could participate in the upcoming Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia if he is invited and if he wants to attend, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told journalists Sunday.“Syria, from tonight, is a full member of the Arab league, and starting tomorrow they have the right to participate in any meeting. When the host nation, in this case Saudi Arabia, sends the invitation, (Assad) can attend if he wishes to,” Gheit said.Officials and analysts have said that Syria’s re-admission into the Arab League, while symbolic, comes with the possibility it could enable Assad’s rehabilitation internationally, and potentially allow the removal of crippling sanctions against his regime.Speaking to CNN earlier this month, HA Hellyer, Middle East scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and at Cambridge University, said Syria’s return to the Arab League “paves the way for member states who might have been holding back to engage more directly with Assad’s regime.”“It also makes it easier for non-member states, like Turkey and others, to argue that a new modus vivendi is in order,” he added.Syria has been under crippling Western sanctions for years, the most prominent being the US’ 2019 Caesar Act, which imposed wide-ranging sanctions that restricted individuals, companies or governments from economic activities assisting Assad’s war effort. The act rendered the entire economy untouchable.The UN says the levels of poverty and food insecurity faced by Syrians today are unprecedented.

Several opposition lawmakers and human rights groups have condemned the police’s actions.However, UK culture secretary Lucy Frazer said that, while the right to protest remains “really important” in a democracy, tactics by demonstrators have shifted in recent years to interrupt people going about their daily lives.She told the BBC that officers had to make “tough calls” on a case-by-case basis, while taking into consideration the significance of the occasion on Saturday.Frazer said the police were tasked with balancing people’s right to protest with overseeing an international event on the world stage.Criticism of the Metropolitan Police, the UK’s largest force, comes amid growing concern over the increase in police powers to stifle dissent in Britain, following the recent introduction of controversial pieces of legislation.In the days leading up to the historic event, the force said its “tolerance for any disruption, whether through protest or otherwise, will be low,” adding: “We will deal robustly with anyone intent on undermining this celebration.”Thousands gathered in central London on Saturday to celebrate the once-in-a-generation occasion. But it also drew demonstrators, with protesters wearing yellow T-shirts booing and shouting “Not My King” throughout the morning.Republic, Britain’s largest anti-monarchy group, told CNN Saturday that police – without providing any reason – arrested organizers of the anti-monarchy protest.At around 7 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) police stopped six of Republic’s organizers and told them they were detaining and searching them, Republic director Harry Stratton said.“They didn’t say why they were arresting them. They didn’t tell them or us where they were taking them. It really is like something out of a police state,” Stratton said.Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, was among those detained. He was later released from police detention.“I have been told many times the monarch is there to defend our freedoms. Now our freedoms are under attack in his name,” Smith said on Twitter.Labour lawmaker Chris Bryant posted on Twitter Saturday: “Freedom of speech is the silver thread that runs through a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.”Jess Phillips, also a Labour lawmaker, said on Twitter: “Our nation and our King is not so fragile as to not be able to take harmless protest of a different view.”UK director of Human Rights Watch, Yasmine Ahmed, described the police’s actions as alarming and “something you would expect to see in Moscow, not London.”The Met said arrests were made on Saturday for offenses including affray, public order offenses, breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.Defending the force’s actions, Commander Karen Findlay said that, while they “absolutely understand public concern,” police also “have a duty to intervene when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption.”Members of environmental activist group Just Stop Oil were also arrested on The Mall outside Buckingham Palace, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported, adding that a large group of the protesters were seen in handcuffs.According to PA, Animal Rising said some of its supporters were apprehended on Saturday while at a training session “miles away from the coronation.” A spokesman for the campaign group, Nathan McGovern, described the arrests as “nothing short of a totalitarian crackdown on free speech and all forms of dissent.”",world,0.0
9,9,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/europe/russian-ballistic-missile-analysis-intl/index.html,Analysis: Ukraine says it stopped a missile Russia said was unstoppable,2023-05-07 06:34:00,"Ukraine’s assertion that a US Patriot defense battery took out one of Russia’s most modern ballistic missiles is a notable moment in the conflict, now in its 15th month,Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military have touted the Kinzhal, or Kh-47, as an example of Russia’s modernized missile arsenal, claiming that its hypersonic speed makes it extremely difficult to intercept.An air-launched ballistic missile, the Kh-47 has a range of some 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), so can be fired far from the battlefield.It travels at about 10 times the speed of sound and is derived from the shorter-range Iskander ballistic missile, which is ground launched. It carries a warhead of nearly 500 kilograms.Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia has only a few dozen Kinzhal missiles in its arsenal – a claim which couldn’t be independently verified.Several Kinzhal missiles were launched at Ukrainian targets in March, but it’s not clear what damage they did or whether they all reached their targets. In April, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Patriot systems had arrived from the US, Germany and the Netherlands.If one of those systems has now destroyed a Kh-47, as the Ukrainians say, it calls into question the capabilities of one of Russia’s new generation of weapons.After the Kinzhal was first tested, Putin told Russia’s Federal Council in 2018: “The unique flight characteristics of the high-speed carrier aircraft allow the missile to be delivered to the point of discharge within minutes.”He also said that its hypersonic speed would allow it to “overcome all existing and, I think, prospective anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems, delivering nuclear and conventional warheads in a range of over 2,000 kilometers.”Russia has made ambitious claims for several of its newer military systems, but their prowess is unproven.Though deployed in small numbers, the Russians’ newest main battle tank, the T-90M, has appeared vulnerable to unsophisticated munitions, and the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, was sunk early in the conflict.Analysts have questioned the Kinzhal’s capabilities during the final phase of its flight, suggesting it may not be as maneuverable or as fast as it approaches a target.The deployment of the Patriot represents a sea change in Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, which have been highly reliant on Soviet-era S-300 air defenses – for which munitions now appear in short supply.The Patriots provide a modern dimension to Ukraine’s air defense layers, as does the German IRIS-T system. But it’s also much more complex, requiring about 100 personnel to operate.Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Inhat said Saturday that the Russians “were saying that the Patriot is an outdated American weapon, and Russian weapons are the best in the world.”“Well, there is confirmation that it effectively works against even a super hypersonic missile.” Ihnat said, adding that intercepting the Kinzhal is “a slap in the face for Russia.”",world,0.0

The execution is almost clinical and they know exactly the houses where people from tribal communities reside,” said the leader, who asked to not be identified due to fears for his safety.“A lot of houses are burnt, all our churches have been vandalized, some have been burnt. I barely escaped – the mob was already in the house. I climbed the fence over to the neighbors’ house. I just came with my laptop bag to this camp. I don’t have anything.”He said there were about 5,500 people staying in his camp and that there were about six or seven camps in Imphal in total.“There have been so many deaths,” he added. “A mother and son they were on their way to a camp. On their way, a mob encountered them and beat the son to death. The mother was trying to protect the son, she was killed too.”CNN reached out to the state government of Manipur and the Indian army for comment on Sunday. There was no immediate response from the state government.The army said it had rescued a total of 23,000 civilians and moved them to operating bases and military garrisons. It added that there was a “ray of hope” and a lull in the fighting due to the rescue work carried out by the 120-125 Army and Assam Rifles, which had been “working tirelessly for the past 96 hours to rescue civilians across all communities, curb violence and restore normalcy.”It said it had also enhanced surveillance efforts using drones and helicopters.Earlier this week the state’s governor, Anusuiya Uikey, issued “shoot-at-sight” orders in an effort to bring the situation under control.The orders were authorized for “extreme cases whereby all forms of persuasion, warning, reasonable force etc. had been exhausted” and the situation “could not be controlled,” a statement from Manipur’s home department said.Skirmishes first broke out after thousands of tribal people took part in a rally organized by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur, against the potential inclusion of the state’s majority Meitei ethnic group in India’s “Scheduled Tribe” grouping.The Meitei community, who make up about 50% of the state’s population, have for years campaigned to be recognized as a scheduled tribe, which would give them access to wider benefits including health, education and government jobs.Scheduled tribes are among the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups in India and have historically been denied access to education and job opportunities.If the Meitei community are given scheduled tribe status, other tribal groups say they fear they will not have a fair chance for jobs and other benefits.",world,0.0

Berkovich also received a nomination for best director.Theater critics described the production as “exposing the mechanics of terrorism.”The 38-year-old Berkovich was remanded in custody for two months until July 4, despite her lawyers asking if she could be granted house arrest to take care of her two adopted, disabled daughters.The charges against her carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.The arrests shocked Russia’s shrinking theater community and prompted independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta to publish an open letter in support of Berkovich and Petriychuk, calling on Russian authorities to “persecute murderers instead of poets.”In a separate development, authorities in St Petersburg temporarily closed the Maly Drama theater with one of its actors Danila Kozlovsky facing investigation for anti-war posts.Russia’s cultural scene has faced increased repression since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.

The King and Queen waved to huge crowds outside the royal residence, joined by “working royals” and their children, among others.The balcony moment, which featured a slimmed-down flypast by the Royal Air Force, has become a flagship part of royal occasions. Prince Andrew wasn’t present either.Earlier Saturday, Prince Harry was among the first group of royals to enter Westminster Abbey, arriving alongside his uncles, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, and two of his cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.Harry, wearing a morning suit and medals, sat with Andrew in the third row of the service. Both are non-working royals and did not perform any duties during the ceremony.He did not join members of his family to ride in an impressive procession back to the palace. Instead, he got into a car alone and departed the abbey shortly after the service had ended.The King’s youngest son had reportedly returned to London on Friday. His wife, Meghan, stayed behind in the California with their children to celebrate Prince Archie’s fourth birthday.There was widespread speculation in the build-up to Saturday’s celebrations over whether Harry would have a role in proceedings – and if his return might suggest the family has moved on from the rift that saw the Sussexes step back from their role as senior members of the royal family.Harry launched a series of incendiary accusations against members of his family in “Spare,” in which he recalled a number of private confrontations between him and other senior royals and detailed his split from the family.Among the most explosive claims in the autobiography, published January, was Harry’s allegation that his older brother, Prince William, knocked him onto the floor during an argument over Meghan.CNN royal historian Kate Williams previously described Harry’s appearance at the coronation as a “flying visit.”“[Prince Harry] is coming for this major event of his father’s coronation but it’s not going to be a family reunion. We’re not going to see lots of big family meet-ups. Certainly, there has been damage done,” she explained.Williams added that Harry’s presence was a “show of unity” – but the extent of that unity remains to be seen.Sign up for CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.",style,0.0
13,13,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/europe/france-bruno-le-maire-erotica-intl/index.html,French minister’s book goes erotic – and he’s not even the first to do so,2023-05-07 04:14:00,"France’s finance minister is in the spotlight. But it’s not the country’s downgraded credit rating, nor the government’s hated retirement age hike that’s got people talking.His work “Fugue Americaine” – which includes a scene with an unforgettable phrase about an anus – has brought mockery, even in France, where a politician writing erotica is nothing new.The offending passage has thrown a harsh light back on the storied history of French politicians’ flirtations with literary careers.Le Maire’s fourth book in five years, the release of “Fugue Americaine” saw the minister face questions about his moonlighting as a writer.“10 lines on 480 pages – you should read the book,” he said Wednesday to French broadcaster France Info, his exasperation evident at being questioned on the book’s most erotic scene a week after its publication.“It is about music, my passion for music,” Le Maire insisted of the novel, whose central character is a piano virtuoso.For France’s finance chief, politics and prose go hand in hand.“If there were only politics – without the freedom that literary and romantic creation gives – politics would not be enough,” he said in an interview last week.“A lot of civil servants, senior civil servants like to take on an intellectual dimension especially, I would say, a literary one,” Luc Rouban, the head of the Centre for National Scientific Research attached to Science Po, France’s political sciences university, told CNN.“It’s a bit of provocation,” the researcher added, “that’s largely part of the culture of the grande bourgeoisie.”Le Maire is no stranger to harsh critiques, or steamy lines. His first book – “Le Ministre”, a memoir of his early years in the foreign ministry – describes an intimate scene with his wife in a Venetian bath.And after years of rumors, the finance minister finally admitted to his pseudonym ‘Duc William’, the name he used as a student to write a passionate erotic novel about a doctor and a married woman.Le Maire has been stoic on his infamy. “Who cares?” he told France Info, when asked if he was worried about being mocked.He’s far from the first to feel similar heat.Marie Minelli, known in her day job as junior social affairs minister Marlène Schiappa, has written titles including “Dare to Have a Female Orgasm” and “Letter to my Uterus.”She ruffled feathers recently by appearing fully clothed on the cover of Playboy magazine.The crime novel of Macron’s former prime minister, Edouard Phillipe, also came with a few titillating passages, including one detailing the perfect bosom.“A real chest is round, it’s comfortable, it’s welcoming and you have to be able to put your nose in the middle with jubilation,” he wrote.The aristocratic President Giscard d’Estaing wrote a bestseller in office and infamously, later in life, the novel “La Princess et le President,” about a fling with the Princess of Wales, thought to represent Princess Diana.It is common for French men of state to write, Rouban said. During his mandate, President Georges Pompidou edited a collection of poetry while the retired President Charles De Gaulle wrote his memoirs.Times may have changed.While the corner of erotica in Le Maire’s latest literary offering may have provoked sniggers, it’s not so much the content as the time commitment to his writing that has annoyed parts of the French public.Some in France chastized the finance minister for devoting time to writing, especially as the country weathers economic headwinds.Rising inflation has challenged the French economy since 2021, reaching a peak in early 2023 of 7.2%. That figure, while historically high for France, still remains low for parts of Europe today.The French finance ministry confirmed to CNN that Le Maire had warned the French presidency of the book before its release.And the finance minister seemed unabashed on Twitter.“Literature allows me to escape my everyday life, to take a step back, to think differently,” he said in a statement. “It is a need that is worth waking up early for, worth going to bed late for, to spend one’s weekends and one’s holidays.”",world,0.0

A 21-year old gunman wielding an automatic weapon killed eight people in the village of Dubona, south of the capital city. The gunman has been arrested following a massive overnight manhunt involving hundreds of special forces.“This never happened in Serbia before. We only heard about this [happening in] the United States. You could never dream that this would happen here,” Belgrade resident Marko Kovacevic told CNN.  “This is the worst thing that happened in Serbia since the bombing in 1999,” another resident, David Stevens, told CNN at a vigil in Belgrade.The reaction was swift. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić promised on Friday, just hours after the second shooting, that the government will make urgent changes to the country’s firearm legislation.He proposed tougher conditions for people who wish to purchase weapons and a national gun buyback program for those who can’t fulfill those conditions.“Great nations managed to find solutions after big tragedies,” Vučić said during a news conference on Friday. “We have to find the way to live freely and to confront this evil,” he said.The government is also proposing a two-year moratorium on the issuing of new gun permits and a review of existing permits within the next three months.It is also looking to potentially ban cell phones from schools and put new regulations on social media – specifically aimed at “content that can seriously harm the physical, mental or moral development of minors.”The massacres have left many in Serbia aghast, with questions about the motives behind them high on people’s minds.The night before the killings at the Belgrade elementary, the 13-year-old suspect was up late watching videos on TikTok and an American documentary about a school shooting, according to Belgrade police chief Veselin Milić, who declined to name the specific film.“This murderer said that he had seen some weird American film where a boy did the same in his school. The murderer had no empathy or remorse,” he told CNN in an interview on Thursday.The teenage suspect fired 57 rounds inside Vladislav Ribnikar Elementary, a prestigious school in an upscale part of Belgrade. The police said he was remarkably proficient in the way he handled the weapon, changing clips as he moved through the school.He used two handguns that his father owned legally and kept in a locked safe.Milić said that the boy’s father had previously taken him to a gun range in the basement of Belgrade’s FK Partizan football club’s stadium – even though it is illegal in Serbia for young people to handle guns.Asked about the legality of teaching a child to use a gun, Milić said, “It’s absolutely illegal. It’s neither normal nor natural.”The school shooting on Wednesday sparked questions about criminal responsibility after it emerged that the suspect cannot be held liable.Under Serbian law, children under 14 cannot be held criminally responsible. The suspect’s parents have been detained for possible crimes related to the boy’s access to the locked safe where they stored the gun, but they have not yet been formally charged.“It is terrifying to see such a young person has the capacity to perform such a horrendous act,” Stevens added.The boy is currently being held in a psychiatric facility, but his long-term future is unclear. Milić said the suspect was not under the influence of drugs at the time of the shooting, and had not been the victim of bullying, though he had recently fallen out with his friends and changed classes in an attempt to fit in.Many are also questioning the initial reaction of the school authorities. While there was an armed police officer on the school campus that day, Belgrade police said the officer didn’t immediately run towards the sound of gunfire, but instead waited for backup, then entered the school minutes later to arrest the suspect – who had called police himself.For comparison, in the US, where school shootings have tragically become regular occurrence in recent years, police are trained to immediately go towards the sound of gunfire and try to take out the shooter.Belgrade police have not yet responded to CNN’s requests for clarification on its own protocols and whether they were followed in this case.On Wednesday night in Belgrade, crowds gathered to protest against the authorities, demanding the resignation of Education Minister Branko Ružić. His deputy, Milan Pašić, told CNN his boss had offered his resignation, but it was not clear if it would be accepted. The offer was not enough for some teachers in the city, who plan to walk out on Friday over school safety concerns.Pašić insisted that the school was as safe as it could have been. “Unfortunately, it happened in school, but it could’ve happened on the street, in the park. In any case this is just one tragic case,” he said.For the past three days, there has been plenty of public discussion about mental health, parental responsibility, violent video games, social media and, of course, guns.While Serbia is a country that has known violence, conflict and war, it has not had to reckon with questions around this type of mass shooting.It has the highest level of civilian gun ownership in Europe, and the fifth-highest in the world – a legacy of years of conflict in the 1990s. But getting a gun legally is a complicated process that requires a background check, medical check and a training course. The person wanting a gun also has to prove they have a good reason to own one.In the meantime, ordinary people are doing what they can, as victims continue to fight for their lives in hospital. A blood donation clinic close to the school in central Belgrade said it had twice as many donors as usual turn up to give blood following the shooting.",politics,0.0
16,16,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/europe/wagner-prigozhin-russia-ukraine-analysis-intl/index.html,Putin faces a deluge of bad news as Wagner says it will withdraw from frontline and Kremlin comes under attack,2023-05-05 09:16:00,"“These are someone’s f**king fathers and someone’s sons. And you f**kers who aren’t giving [us] ammunition, you b*tches, will have your guts eaten out in hell!” yelled Prigozhin in Thursday’s video.In just the past 48 hours, the Kremlin made a stark admission its seat of power in the heart of Moscow, was attacked by what it claimed were Ukrainian drones in a bid to assassinate President Vladimir Putin.And then this morning, perhaps the most prominent figure in Russia’s military, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the self-promoting head of the private military company Wagner, used his Telegram account to say he will withdraw his forces from Bakhmut on May 10.There is not even an “unless” attached to the threat. He simply says it will happen, so they can “lick their wounds,” as they refuse to fight on senselessly without enough artillery shells to function. And it will happen just after the May 9 Victory Day pomp and celebration, as, he insists, Wagner are patriots.It is unclear whether Prigozhin hopes to leverage more weapons supplies, power, or money from these statements. He has stood before in front of the corpses of the Russian mercenaries and convicts he has launched at the frontline – without proper training or equipment – and demanded more ammunition.He has also apparently been stymied from emptying out Russia’s prisons for new recruits, by the Russian Ministry of Defense employing convicts directly. But he has never said he will likely cripple one of Russia’s most symbolic frontlines by just walking away.Wagner forces may constitute about half Russia’s presence around a city that has minimal strategic importance, but has gained huge symbolic weight since Moscow declared it a key objective last year. Both sides sent thousands of men to die in the fight. Now, the key advocate of the operation says he will just walk away in five days.It won’t be that easy. Wagner forces would have to walk out of a battlefield which is – on the surface – for the most part controlled by Putin’s Ministry of Defense. Russian deserters have been shot on the frontline, repeatedly, according to multiple reports.Withdrawal is a dangerous and complex operation at the best of times, and so on Wednesday, Wagner cannot simply hand the Airbnb keys over to Russian troops, and drive to the airport. Ukrainian forces will be keen to exploit any chaos to target withdrawing Wagner troops, and also wary of becoming sucked into committing forces to retaking the city, at a time when their wider counteroffensive seems to be getting underway.For weeks, it has seemed that Prigozhin’s long-running, public feud with the top brass in the Russian Ministry of Defense might have subsided. Yet that is – at least publicly – not the case. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov could only admit he had read about Prigozhin’s declaration in the media and would not comment on it.The Putin administration does not like appearing weak. The bedrock of the President and his ministers’ hold on power is that they are the calm, controlled, ruthless masters of Russia’s geopolitical destiny – ensuring order in the storm. An attack on the Kremlin, and the declaration that a private mercenary group will walk out on a key frontline, are not a good look – whatever the truth behind each situation.Putin is absorbing a lot of bad vibes at the moment to seem that much in control. It is unlikely that any fissures at the heart of the Kremlin would be made public before they were acted upon. But these odd traces of disunity, or appalling security failings, do not support the concept of a president still executing a calm plan. They are reacting, rolling, and stumbling forward as unhelpful events unfold.On the other side, Ukraine is, it seems, pressing on with its plan. Its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, just completed a symbolic tour of allied European nations, including The Hague in the Netherlands, where he got to joke he wanted to see “the other Vladimir” answer to his indictment in that court.Indications from its military are of slight progress in the East, and readiness in the South. And Ukraine’s much-improved air defenses have made repeated nights of drone attacks from Russia a far less ghastly event than would have been the case a few months ago.It is dangerous to predict how these unprecedented events may unfold. It is an equally dangerous moment in the war too, now that a Russian president – for the most part rational and calm, despite his disastrous decision to invade Ukraine – is faced with a whirlwind of bad public news that rips the carpet out from under the facade of his control.",world,0.0

It’s historic and is exceptionally powerful and much appreciated,” Mirvis added.Although the monarchy is steeped in Christianity – the sovereign is also the head of the Church of England – the Chief Rabbi praised Charles’ “wonderful sensitivity” and inclusion of other faiths.“First of all, (Charles) is saying the right thing,” he said. “But what’s more impressive is he’s actually carrying it out, he is implementing that. I come across him often, it is exceptionally genuine. He cares about all other faiths, and he wants to do his best and therefore, we’re now into a wonderful era, which sends a very powerful message right around the globe.”Mirvis added that the Jewish community in the UK will be recording the coronation to watch it once Shabbat is over, while special prayers will be recited in synagogues both in Britain and around the Commonwealth.",world,0.0

All special police units were engaged, including an anti-terrorism unit, helicopter unit, and police forces from the cities of Belgrade and Smederevo.The suspect – identified by authorities as a 21-year-old male named Uros B – was arrested on Friday morning. Serbian police confiscated four hand grenades from the home where the suspect was hiding, according to RTS.The Interior Ministry confirmed to CNN that they are treating this incident as an act of domestic terrorism, but did not specify more details.A police officer and his sister were among those killed, according to local media.Milos Stanisavljević, a local resident, left his house in Sepsin during the night to see what was happening outside. The police mistook him for the shooter and arrested him. He was later released without charge.“My family stayed in the house. My child was sleeping,” Stanisavljevic told CNN. He described how police swept through the town, checking each house one by one. “It was dark and we didn’t know where [the shooter] was hiding.”“I was so scared,” he said.On Wednesday, Serbia was rocked by news of a 13-year-old boy opening fire on classmates at a school in the capital Belgrade. That shooting left at least eight children dead, along with a security guard.Serbia’s president Aleksander Vucic expressed his condolences to the victims of the two attacks and pledged that the government will make urgent changes in weapon legislation.“We are united in pain and sorrow,” Vucic told reporters at a press conference on Friday morning. “This is an attack on all our country and every citizen feels it.”He announced that Serbia will hire 1,200 new police officers in the next six months to bolster security in schools, and pledged to introduce tougher gun control laws.Among the proposed changes were stricter conditions for people to purchase weapons, doubling fines for people found breaking the law, requiring hunters to go through annual checks and a national gun buyback program for those who can’t fulfil the tougher conditions.Until this week, mass shootings were rare in Serbia, despite the country’s high rate of gun ownership. Serbia has the highest level of civilian gun ownership in Europe, and the fifth-highest in the world – a legacy of years of conflict in the 1990s.",world,0.0

And Kyiv is already executing what it is told to do,” Peskov said.Peskov did not provide any evidence to his claims, nor additional details regarding the alleged attack, saying that information would be released later.Earlier this week, Russia claimed Ukraine launched a drone strike targeting the Kremlin in an attempt to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it a “planned terrorist attack.” Ukraine has strongly denied any involvement.John Kirby, the US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, denied Russia’s “ludicrous” claim the US directed Ukraine to carry out the alleged attack and kill Putin, and accused the president’s spokesperson of lying.“I would just tell you Mr. Peskov’s lying. I mean, it’s obviously a ludicrous claim. The United States had nothing to do with this. We don’t even know what happened here,” said Kirby.“But I can assure you the United States had no role in it whatsoever.”The White House still has no indication who was behind the drone attack and Kirby said the US does not “endorse, we do not encourage, we do not support attacks on individual leaders.”Russia doubled down on its bellicose rhetoric later Thursday when Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told local media that relations between the US and Russia are on the verge of an “open-armed conflict.”“We are working to prevent relations with the US from plunging into the abyss of an open armed conflict. We are already standing on the edge, on the edge of this precipice,” Ryabkov told Russia’s Channel One Thursday, according to state media agency TASS.Ryabkov also accused US officials of trying to “promote the idea of Washington’s non-involvement” in the purported drone attack, TASS reported.“Washington has long been a direct party to the Ukrainian conflict and aims to destroy sovereign Russia,” he said, according to TASS.CNN has reached out to the US State Department and the White House for comment on Ryabkov’s remarks.Earlier Thursday, Kirby said since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Moscow has been “trying to paint this war as some sort of fight with the West against Russia, NATO against Russia, the United States against Russia.”“And, of course, it’s not; Russia is the aggressor here,” he said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Wednesday’s purported drone attack on the Kremlin was a “hostile act” and that his government would respond with “concrete actions.”“It was clearly a hostile act,” Lavrov said at a press conference in India. “We will not respond by talking about whether it was an incident or not, but we will respond with concrete actions. We have a lot of patience.”The escalating war of words comes as Russia launched its most forceful air bombardment on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in a year, the Kyiv City Military Administration said Thursday.All Russian missiles and drones “were destroyed in Kyiv airspace” by Ukrainian air defense forces on Thursday, avoiding civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure, the capital’s military chief said.Meanwhile in the southern port city of Kherson, Russian shelling of the city and its surrounding villages killed at least 23 people, the regional military chief said Thursday. Moscow struck Kherson at least 16 times, firing over 80 shells at Pryvokzalna Square, a railway station and crossing, a gas station, two stores, a factory and a car repair shop, the regional military administration said.And in southeastern Zaporizhzhia, concerns have once again been raised about the safety of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant that is currently under Russia’s control.On Wednesday, Ukraine’s State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate accused Russia of placing weapons, explosives and military equipment in one of the power plant’s units. The Inspectorate said it received the information during its weekly meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency representatives a day earlier.Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russian-appointed military-civilian administration in occupied Zaporizhzhia, called the claims “a lie,” adding that, “we do not use the nuclear power plant as a military facility.”",world,0.0
20,20,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/uk/coronation-of-king-charles-iii-preview-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html,Everything you need to know about King Charles III’s coronation,2023-05-05 04:37:00,"With the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at her rural Balmoral home in September, Charles III instantly became King. In the days that followed, he was formally proclaimed Britain’s new monarch and now, after months of painstaking preparation, his coronation is upon us.Heir to the throne for 70 years, Charles will be officially crowned in a magnificent and deeply religious ceremony on May 6. Thousands will gather at Westminster Abbey and the surrounding streets of central London to take in a glorious display of British pageantry.There’s a lot of speculation floating around, and some elements are still being fine-tuned, but if it’s official, we’ve got you covered. Here’s CNN’s essential guide to the celebrations – we’ll keep updating it to ensure you stay in the know.Charles’ accession took place when the Queen died. It was, as expected, a deeply somber period when the nation came together to bid farewell to its longest-reigning sovereign. Eight months on, the coronation will feel very different. This is a moment of public celebration of the new King. It will be a fabulously over-the-top spectacle attended by dignitaries from around the world and watched by billions.The word “coronation” is derived from the Latin word “corona” meaning a crown. But it’s so much more than literally placing the crown on the sovereign’s head. It’s a symbolic coming together of the monarchy, church and state for a religious ritual during which the monarch makes vows to both God and country.Buckingham Palace has said it “will reflect the monarch’s role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.”If you’ve been checking your mailbox and an invitation has yet to drop in, not to worry. The ceremony itself is set to begin at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) on May 6, with CNN’s special TV coverage of the King’s coronation from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (5 a.m. to 12 p.m. ET). Alternatively, join us here on CNN.com for live coverage throughout the day.Charles’ coronation will be shorter than his mother’s seven decades ago. Back then, the ceremony – which was the first live royal event to be televised – ran for more than three hours.This time, the Anglican service will be two hours with “representation from other faiths to reflect the diversity of modern Britain,” according to Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk, whose family has been responsible for orchestrating state occasions since 1482. Coronations have stayed largely the same for more than 1,000 years and organizers are leaning on that structure, so there’s quite a lot to get through.Right, so let’s get down to the specifics. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will conduct the ceremony. The core elements of the service are the recognition, oath, anointing, investiture and crowning, followed by enthronement and homage. The recognition is when the sovereign stands in the theater of the abbey and presents him- or herself to the people. After taking the coronation oath – which is a vow to rule according to law, exercise justice with mercy, and maintain the Church of England – the monarch is anointed with holy oil by the archbishop.This moment is considered the most sacred part of the service and wasn’t televised in 1953. Ahead of Charles’ big day, Archbishop Welby has explained why we won’t see the King either, writing in the official souvenir program that the moment is “a symbol of being commissioned by the people for a special task for which God’s help is needed.” He added: “It is a moment when The King is set apart for service: service of the people of this country, and service of God.”The next part is the investiture, when the sovereign is dressed in sacred coronation robes and presented with the symbols of the monarchy: the orb, coronation ring, scepters and others. Toward the end of the ceremony, St. Edward’s Crown is placed atop the monarch’s head before he or she takes the throne. Traditionally, princes and peers then make their way to the sovereign to pay their respects in what is known as homage. This time though, it’s thought that only Prince William will kneel before the King. Meanwhile, the peers have been replaced by the public who have been invited to swear allegiance to Charles if they wish.Lambeth Palace, which is the London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, designed the service – which is rooted in 1,000 years of tradition – in consultation with the King and the UK government, which weighed in on constitutional elements.The service features quite a few pieces of sacred coronation regalia, but let’s talk crowns. We’ve already mentioned St. Edward’s Crown. It’s considered the centerpiece because it’s used at the exact moment of crowning. It was made for Charles II in 1661 following the restoration of the monarchy the year before. Its medieval predecessor – which was melted down in 1649 – was believed to date back to the 11th-century English king, Edward the Confessor.It is not an exact replica of the earlier design but follows the original in featuring four crosses pattée, four fleurs-de-lis and two arches. Made of solid gold, it’s adorned with 444 precious stones – including rubies, amethysts, sapphires and other gems – and is fitted with a purple velvet cap and ermine band. Historically, it was supposed to remain at Westminster Abbey, so a second crown was created for the sovereign to wear out of the abbey.That second crown is the Imperial State Crown, which many will be more familiar with as it’s often used for ceremonial occasions like the State Opening of Parliament. It features a dazzling 2,868 diamonds, including the massive Cullinan II. It was made in 1937 and is a near-replica of Queen Victoria’s earlier Imperial State Crown. The arches in its design were meant to demonstrate that England was not subject to any other earthly power.Once the spiritual elements of the service are over, King Charles and Camilla will head to St. Edward’s Chapel, a stone shrine at the heart of the abbey, where the King will put on the Imperial State Crown in preparation for the return to Buckingham Palace.The King will be reusing several historical garments worn by previous monarchs at past coronations during the Saturday service in the “interests of sustainability and efficiency,” according to Buckingham Palace.“His Majesty will reuse vestments which featured in the Coronation Services of King George IV in 1821, King George V in 1911, King George VI in 1937 and Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, including the Colobium Sindonis, the Supertunica, the Imperial Mantle, the Coronation Sword Belt and the Coronation Glove,” the palace outlined.“Although it is customary for the Supertunica and the Imperial Mantle to be reused, His Majesty will also reuse the Colobium Sindonis, Coronation Sword Belt and Coronation Glove worn by his grandfather King George VI, in the interests of sustainability and efficiency,” the palace explained.This is a royal celebration – of course there’s a procession! In fact, there will be two through the streets of the British capital. One will take the King to be crowned, and after the service there’ll be a larger parade back to Buckingham Palace, where the monarch and members of the royal family will make a balcony appearance and watch a flypast of 60 aircraft. The six-minute flyover will include the famous Red Arrows, modern F-35s and Typhoons, and the Battle of Britain memorial flight.The route itself is significantly shorter than the Queen’s five-mile journey to Westminster Abbey back in 1953. Ahead of the service, King Charles will leave Buckingham Palace and head down the Mall in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, accompanied by the Sovereign’s Escort of the Household Cavalry. The procession will pass through Admiralty Arch before turning on to Whitehall and traveling along Parliament Street and on to the abbey. It will return using the same 1.3-mile route, with the monarch traveling this time in the Gold State Coach.London’s Metropolitan Police Service has said more than 29,000 officers will be deployed in the week leading up to the coronation and over the rest of the holiday weekend.The security operation – known as Operation Golden Orb – will be one of the largest the Met has led, the force said Wednesday.“On Coronation Day we will have the largest one-day mobilization of officers seen in decades with just over 11,500 officers on duty,” Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said. “We want Londoners and visitors coming to the city to enjoy this historic and momentous occasion safely and securely.”There’s been a lot of speculation over how the King intends to make his coronation more inclusive while reflecting his vision of the future monarchy. We’ll have to wait and see, but one early indication was announced Friday when Buckingham Palace revealed that faith leaders would lead the first processions into Westminster Abbey.They’ll be followed by representatives from each of the 15 realms where the King is head of state. Flagbearers of each nation will be accompanied by the governors general and prime ministers. This is the first time non-Protestant faith leaders have been given a role in a coronation.Well, we’re not quite sure… yet. Buckingham Palace said Tuesday that details will be shared in due course. Its comments came after questions were raised over how much was being spent on the state event during a national cost-of-living crisis.“I’ve seen a number of different estimated figures floating around, some more fanciful than others. The true figures will be shared in due course where expenditure relates to the Sovereign Grant or Government costs,” a palace spokesperson said in a statement.The statement went on to say that great state occasions, such as the Queen’s funeral, tend to generate more money than is spent holding such events, attracting huge global interest which boosts the national economy.“Aside from the expenditure estimates you may have seen, it has also been reported that somewhere between one and several billions are expected to flow into the economy as a result of this Coronation,” the spokesperson continued.“It’s not for me to say how accurate those figures are but certainly the theory pertains that the celebrations are an enormous economic boost to the nation – and just as importantly, with 100 heads of State coming to Britain for the event, it’s a fantastic opportunity for networking, for Government, and for engaging the interest from those nations with everything that Britain has to offer.”The statement concluded by assuring the British public that the planning of the King’s coronation was mindful of the “economic challenge” the country was facing, prompting organizers to look for ways to efficiently produce the event, such as “reusing many ceremonial elements, rather than commissioning new ones.”Yes. But unlike the three most recent queen consorts – Alexandra, who was Edward VII’s wife; George V’s wife, Mary; and Elizabeth, wife of George VI – Camilla is not having a crown made specially for her coronation. Instead, she’s opted to wear Queen Mary’s Crown. Back when she paid for the silver crown in 1911, Queen Mary’s intention was for it to serve as the permanent crown of future consorts.The palace has said Camilla’s choice was “in the interests of sustainability and efficiency” but that she was making some “minor changes and additions.” Specifically, she wants to honor her late mother-in-law by resetting the crown with some diamonds – the Cullinan III, IV and V – from the Queen’s personal collection.The Duke of Sussex has confirmed his attendance at his father’s big day. However, he’ll be going solo. The palace confirmed in April that his wife, Meghan, will be staying in California with their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. It is understood Meghan opted to forgo the celebrations as the day coincides with Archie’s 4th birthday.As a member of the royal family, Prince Andrew is expected to attend his brother’s coronation. But as he’s no longer a working royal, he won’t have any formal roles on the day.Around 2,300 people were sent invitations to the service at Westminster Abbey. While the palace doesn’t release a detailed guest list, it has confirmed that the congregation will be made up of members of the royal family, as well as international representatives from 203 countries, alongside community and charity volunteers.Coronation organizer Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk said: “For the first time, approximately 100 Heads of State from around the world will attend, together with representatives from the Realms and the Commonwealth and our government, the Lords and the Commons, local heroes and British Empire medalists and many other individuals who have contributed so much to Britain and the wider world today.”US first lady Jill Biden will lead the American delegation. You can also expect to see a number of royals from around the world make their way to London.Additionally, 400 young people from charities selected by the King and Queen have been invited to watch the service from nearby St. Margaret’s Church, while military veterans, healthcare workers and charity representatives have been given spaces to watch on the processional route and in special stands put up along the Mall and near Buckingham Palace.We’ve already mentioned that both the processional route and service will be shorter. Another difference is the number of guests. Back in ’53, so swollen was the guest list that temporary structures had to be erected within the abbey to accommodate the more than 8,000 people invited.Specific to the service itself, it will lean on tradition but also be full of firsts, according to Lambeth Palace organizers. Some of the changes to the ancient Christian ceremony – the theme of which is “called to serve” – include the King praying aloud, participation of religious leaders from other faiths, involvement of female clergy and the incorporation of other languages spoken in the British Isles.Additionally, the traditional homage of peers has been replaced with a “homage of the people.” This tweak will see the public invited to join “a chorus of millions of voices enabled for the first time in history to participate in this solemn and joyful moment.”A Lambeth Palace spokesperson said the new homage was “an opportunity for those who wish to be given voice within the service, and for those at home to have a chance to be an extension of the abbey congregation.” The spokesperson added that the change was “very much an invitation, rather than an expectation or request.”“We live in a wonderfully diverse society with many different perspectives and beliefs – which this coronation celebrates – and therefore it’s quite right that people decide for themselves how they wish to relate to this moment,” the spokesperson added.On May 7, the day after the coronation, thousands of events are expected to take place across the country as part of the “Coronation Big Lunch,” while Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Take That will headline the “Coronation Concert” at Windsor Castle in the evening.“The Coronation Big Lunch helps you bring the celebration right into your own street or back yard,” said Peter Stewart, chief purpose officer at the event’s organizing body, the Eden Project.“Sharing friendship, food and fun together gives people more than just a good time – people feel less lonely, make friends and go on to get more involved with their community,” he added in a statement.The concert will be attended by an audience of volunteers from the King and Queen’s charity affiliations as well as several thousand members of the public selected through a national ballot held by the BBC. However, some royal fans have slammed Ticketmaster over its handling of the ticketing for May 7.Ten locations around Britain will also be lit up with light displays, lasers and drones that evening.The final day of the long weekend will see Britons enjoying a hopefully sunny bank holiday Monday, with the public encouraged to volunteer in their communities.",world,0.0
21,21,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/middleeast/syria-arab-normalization-us-objections-mime-intl/index.html,Arab nations set to rehabilitate Syria’s pariah president in defiance of US,2023-05-05 11:19:00,"Arab nations are set to re-admit Syria into the Arab League despite repeated objections from the United States to ending the decade-long isolation of a regime that it holds accountable for the deaths of more 300,000 civilians and displacement of millions in the country’s brutal civil war.Speaking to CNN’s Becky Anderson Thursday, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said he believes there are enough votes among Arab League members for Syria to return to the bloc, adding that Jordan has kept the US informed in its efforts to rebuild ties with the regime.Officials and analysts have said that Syria’s re-admission into the Arab League, while symbolic, comes with the hope that it could pave the way for President Bashar Al Assad’s rehabilitation internationally, and potentially the removal of crippling sanctions against his regime.“Ultimately in order for us to really end [the crisis], we will have to make sure that the whole international community is on board,” Safadi said. “Because at the end of the day there are sanctions, European sanctions, American sanctions, and there’s going to be a tremendous need for a global effort for reconstruction.”But just this week, US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel made it clear that that Washington is not on board with such plans. The US “will not normalize relations with the Assad regime and we do not support others normalizing with Damascus either,” he said at a State Department briefing in Washington, DC.“We’ve made this abundantly clear to our partners,” Patel said. “The US believes that a political solution that is outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 2254 is the only viable solution to this conflict in Syria.”Resolution 2254 endorses a roadmap for a peace process in Syria through UN-facilitated talks between the Syrian government and opposition members.Arab states have argued that the status quo in Syria is untenable and has caused them a headache at home. Syria has over the past decade turned into a narco-state, exporting highly addictive amphetamines across the border to Jordan and to Saudi Arabia.In the absence of what they see as lack of progress from the international community in its efforts to bring an end to the war there, Arab states have insisted on finding a regional solution, even if that means making peace with a leader whose regime has been accused of egregious war crimes.Safadi told CNN that the Arab world is now taking the lead on resolving the Syrian crisis, as “there was no effective effort” so far to do so.In a Wednesday opinion piece in Saudi newspaper Arab News, Assistant Secretary-General of the Arab League Hossam Zaki said that the May 19 summit is “a step on the road toward finding and activating Arab solutions to Arab problems and crises.”Syria’s return to the Arab League “paves the way for member states who might have been holding back to engage more directly with Assad’s regime,” HA Hellyer, Middle East scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and at Cambridge University, told CNN. “It also makes it easier for non-member states, like Turkey and others, to argue that a new modus vivendi is in order.”Syria has been under crippling Western sanctions for years, the most prominent being the US’ 2019 Caesar Act, which imposed wide-ranging sanctions that restricted individuals, companies or governments from economic activities assisting Assad’s war effort. The act rendered the entire economy untouchable.The UN says the levels of poverty and food insecurity faced by Syrians today are unprecedented. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that as of 2022, more than 12 million Syrians – more than half of the country’s population – are food insecure.It’s unclear if the US will stand in the way of Arab states’ efforts to bring Syria back into the regional fold. Safadi told CNN that Jordan and other Arab countries are constantly discussing the matter with Washington and are working towards a solution that is consistent with UN Resolution 2254.Analysts say that while Western states may object to the normalization, they are unlikely to translate that objection into any kind of action against the Arab states, citing other international issues that take priority, as well as fatigue with the Syrian question.“The US will not impose a veto on their allies when it comes to normalization with Assad,” said Hellyer. “The political will for such a move doesn’t exist in DC, particularly when there are so many other files that are taking bandwidth for the US, both in (the Middle East), but also more widely internationally, with Ukraine and other issues.”Qutaiba Idlbi, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, said that US normalization with the Assad regime is unlikely to bring any foreign policy or security benefits to the Biden administration, and will therefore not be pursued, especially ahead of the presidential elections next year. Arab normalization, he argued, may be seen in a positive light in Washington despite its public objections as it “strengthens regional leadership on regional issues.”Given the wide-ranging scope of the sanctions on the regime, however, Syria is more likely to get a political lifeline from normalization than an economic one, analysts said – at least until Arab states can persuade the international community to embrace the Syrian president. Analysts say that’ll be a tough sell.Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, said the sanctions have left both American and European governments “handcuffed,” placing a legal impediment to engagement with the regime.“As we watch these regional steps, which are at least symbolically significant, I don’t think we are going to be seeing much more than political contact,” he told CNN. “We are certainly not going to see some major shift toward investment in Syria… none of that is going to be feasible without Western diplomatic and economic support. And that is just completely off the table.”",politics,0.0
22,22,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/middleeast/syria-jordan-arab-league-intl/index.html,Arab League may have enough votes to bring Syria back into the fold,2023-05-05 11:18:00,"Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi believes there are enough votes among Arab League members for Syria to return to the organization, adding that it is “only the beginning” of bringing a political end to the Syrian crisis.Members of the League will vote on a “reversal of the freeze on Syria’s membership” on Sunday in Cairo at “an extraordinary session called for to discuss Syria and Sudan,” a senior diplomatic official told CNN.If Syria’s membership is approved, the Syrian delegation at the high-level Arab League summit on May 19 is “very likely” to be presided by President Bashar Al Assad, the official told CNN.The Syrian president had been boycotted by several Arab states for his crackdown on protests in 2011, violence which led to more than a decade of civil war.“The whole movement in the Arab world to try and have a leading role in efforts to bring about a political end to the Syrian crisis took place against a backdrop, a reality in which there was no effective effort to solve the crisis,”  Safadi told CNN. “It was pretty much status quo politics and status quo politics only resulted in more ills and more pain and suffering for the Syrian people, and growing threats to the region, including Jordan,” he continued.Safadi said that “everybody” in the Arab League is on board to end the Syrian crisis, but there are differences on what the best approach is.“The return to the Arab League will be symbolic…but ultimately in order for us to really end it [the crisis], we will have to make sure that the whole international community is on board, because at the end of the day there are sanctions, European sanctions, American sanctions, and there’s going to be a tremendous need for a global effort for re-construction,” he added.The rehabilitation of the Syria has faced opposition from Western countries. The United States said it “will not normalize relations with the Assad regime and we do not support others normalizing with Damascus either,” according to State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel.“We’ve made this abundantly clear to our partners,” Patel said at a department briefing Wednesday. “The US believes that a political solution that is outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 2254 is the only viable solution to this conflict in Syria.”Asked by CNN if Jordan has the support of the US in its efforts to bring an end to the Syrian crisis, the country’s foreign minister said that Jordan and other Arab countries are constantly discussing the matter with Washington and are working towards a solution that is consistent with the UN’s resolution.The foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Jordan met in the Jordanian capital Amman on Monday to discuss how to normalize ties with Syria. According to a statement issued after the meeting, Syria has agreed to help end drug trafficking across its borders with Iraq and Jordan.Safadi told CNN many people have suffered consequences due to the Syrian crisis, including Jordan, and will make sure to do whatever it takes to mitigate any threat to Jordan’s security.“We are not taking the threat of drug smuggling lightly. If we do not see effective measures to curb that threat, we will do what it takes to counter that threat, including taking military action inside Syria to eliminate this extremely dangerous threat not just in Jordan, but through Jordan to the Gulf countries, other Arab countries and the world.”",politics,0.0

The sisters were killed in the shooting while their mother succumbed to her wounds in hospital several days later.They had been on a “family outing” during the Passover holiday, according to a statement issued by the council of Efrat, the Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank where they lived.The Al Qassam Brigade, the militant wing of Hamas, said the men killed Thursday were Hassan Qatanani, Muath al-Masri, and Ibrahim Jaber.The brigade called them “heroes of the Jordan Valley operation that was carried out about a month ago, in which three settlers were killed, in response to the occupation’s crimes against Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the assault on Muslim women.”The Dee family’s deaths came at a time of heightened tensions and increased violence in the region, following Israeli police raids on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Dozens of rockets were launched from Lebanon, Gaza and Syria into Israeli territory, followed by Israeli retaliatory strikes.The Israel Defense Forces Thursday morning released the same names for the men killed in Nablus.They were located following “an extensive ISA (Israel Security Agency) and IDF intelligence and operational effort,” the security forces said.“During an exchange of fire, both of the terrorists were killed. In addition, Ibrahim Jaber, a senior operative who aided the two terrorists, was killed,” the military statement said. It also said two M-16 rifles and an AK-47 were found in the apartment where the men were discovered.At the time the Dees were killed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the killings as a “heinous attack” by “terrorists” and instructed Israeli police “to mobilize all border police units in reserve and the IDF to mobilize additional forces,” according to his office.Thousands of mourners attended their funerals.A statement from the Dee family on Thursday said they were “delighted to hear that the terrorists were eliminated today.”“Most of all, that it was done in a way that apparently did not endanger the lives of Israeli soldiers, because that was one of the most important things from our family’s perspective,” the statement said.Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said, “Israel’s defense establishment will reach any terrorist that harms our citizens.”“I commend our security forces for neutralizing the terrorists who conducted the terror attack in Hamra, which took the lives of Lucy Dee, and her daughters Rina and Maya,” he said.In a separate development on Thursday, a Palestinian woman was shot and killed after stabbing an Israeli soldier in the flashpoint town of Huwara in the occupied West Bank, officials said.The Palestinian Ministry of Health named her Iman Ziad Ahmad Odeh, 26.The Palestinian Red Crescent said she was shot in the chest by Israeli soldiers and transferred in a critical condition to Nablus Hospital, where she died.The victim of the stabbing was 20, the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday. He was mildly injured and taken to hospital.“The soldier was lightly injured, pushed away the assailant and neutralized her along with an additional soldier in the area,” the IDF said",world,0.0
24,24,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/middleeast/saudi-diplomacy-iran-sudan-mime-intl/index.html,Saudi Arabia wants to be a bigger player in the Middle East — this time with diplomacy,2023-05-04 03:50:00,"When Iranian evacuees from Sudan were being flown out of Saudi Arabia on Saturday, a top Saudi military official went as far as boarding their plane back home to bid them a warm farewell.“(This is) your country,” the kingdom’s Western Region Commander Major General Ahmed Al-Dabais declared to the departing Iranians as he held hands with Hassan Zarangar, Iran’s charge d’affaires to the kingdom. “If you need anything in Saudi, you’re most welcome… Iran and Saudi, they are brothers.”Sixty-five Iranians evacuated from Sudan by the Saudi military were welcomed in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah with flowers, images of which were broadcast on both Iranian and Saudi state television. Dabais told Zarangar that the friendly welcome for the Iranians was “from the directives of the leadership, from the king, from the crown prince.”Such images would have been inconceivable just months ago, when Iran and Saudi Arabia were bitter regional foes engaging in multiple proxy conflicts across the Middle East. But the two buried the hatchet in March with Chinese mediation after nearly seven years of hostility, and hope to re-open embassies soon.“This can only bring goodwill from the Iranians with the hope that it will be reciprocated,” Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst and writer, told CNN.The kingdom is now on a mission to revamp its global image and mend fences with former foes.The diplomatic efforts are the latest in a series of moves that position Riyadh in a peacemaking role, which analysts say is a strategic pivot away from more than a decade of a confrontational and interventionist foreign policy.“There is a new foreign policy at play here,” Anna Jacobs, senior Gulf analyst at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank, told CNN. “Saudi Arabia is seeking to assert itself more and more on the international stage through mediation and raising its diplomatic profile.”Riyadh’s new foreign policy is more independent and prioritizes Saudi interests, she said.The kingdom’s latest attempt at diplomacy came in Sudan, where forces loyal to two rival generals, Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) commander Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), are vying for control. Hundreds have been killed and thousands injured in the fighting.In images broadcast widely across Saudi news outlets, Saudi Arabian forces were seen evacuating thousands of evacuees from Port Sudan to the coastal city of Jeddah, a 12-hour journey across the Red Sea. Men, women and children were given Saudi flags to wave as cameras documented their arrival.The kingdom on Monday said that it has evacuated more than 5,000 people from over 100 nationalities.“We will do whatever we can to alleviate this crisis,” Fahad Nazer, spokesman for the Saudi embassy in the US, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Tuesday. “We are leading this effort, but we are working very closely with the United States and our regional and international partners.”With the help of the United States, Saudi Arabia last week also mediated a brief truce between Sudan’s SAF commander Al-Burhan and RSF chief Dagalo. The truce was extended for another 72 hours on Monday, and the kingdom is reportedly joining the United Arab Emirates, the US and Egypt in efforts to broker a truce between the two commanders.“The Saudi effort in Sudan was an opportunity to put Saudi’s considerable resources in the Red Sea at the international community’s disposal to help,” said Shihabi. “And that can only reflect well on the Kingdom.”This new diplomacy comes as Saudi Arabia prioritizes economic growth at home, which requires regional stability to succeed. The $1 trillion economy has been on a quest to move away from its traditional reputation as a conservative, combative oil producer, and towards a global economic player and key regional tourism and business hub.Its former interventionist policies, Jacobs said, only “led to greater regional instability and increased security threats against Saudi Arabia.”Aside from Iran, Riyadh is mending ties with Yemen’s Houthis, Turkey and Syria’s regime. It has been spearheading efforts to bring Syria’s pariah President Bashar al-Assad back into the Arab fold over a decade after severing ties with it.And last month, senior leaders from the Palestinian militant group Hamas were seen performing an Islamic pilgrimage in Mecca. Two days later, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, in the nearby city of Jeddah. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have been at odds for over a decade. Saudi Arabia’s ties with Hamas had been strained for the past decade too.Riyadh’s mediation efforts have also gone beyond the Middle East. Last year, the government said it brokered a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine that saw 10 detainees released, including two American veterans and five British citizens.The kingdom in December said that it also helped mediate the release of basketball star player Brittney Griner from Russian detention, in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.Saudi efforts at revamping its image as a peace-broker may face credibility challenges, however, given its near decade-long combative foreign policy and the bad press it attracted.As peace talks between Yemen’s Houthis and the Saudi delegation took place in the Yemeni capital Sanaa last month, Houthi officials were keen to point out that Saudi Arabia is not a mediator in the Yemen conflict, as it has claimed, but rather a participant.The kingdom is now trying to extricate itself from Yemen after intervening in the civil war there in 2015 following the Houthi takeover of Sanaa. In that war, it mobilized an Arab coalition that included Sudan’s RSF. That group is party to the Sudan conflict that Saudi Arabia is trying to help end.Asked by CNN whether the kingdom bears any responsibility for the Sudan conflict given its connections to RSF, Nazer of the Saudi embassy in the US said the kingdom is “engaged with all relevant parties in Sudan” and that Riyadh is “trying to promote an inclusive political process and dialogue that will restore peace and stability to Sudan.”“We’re really frankly not looking backwards,” he said.Despite its controversial past, Saudi Arabia may still carry enough influence to bring quarreling parties to the negotiating table, analysts say. The oil producer is home to Islam’s holiest sites and is one of the richest Arab nations. It has used its wealth to build bridges with some of its former foes, especially after a brief surge in oil prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year.“Saudi (Arabia) does not pretend to be an impartial mediator but its voice carries weight with many parties in the region,” Shihabi said, adding that where it can, Saudi Arabia wants to use that influence to reduce tensions.With additional reporting by CNN’s Mostafa Salem and Zeena Saifi",world,0.0

The IDF said it hit 16 targets in Gaza, saying “we attacked everything we wanted tonight.”Sirens sounded into the early hours of Wednesday morning in Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip and rockets could be heard and seen being launched from the coastal enclave, according to CNN’s team in Jerusalem and Gaza.“The strike was carried out in response to the rocket launches from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory earlier today, this strike significantly harms the capabilities and prevents further weapon acquisition capabilities of the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip,” the IDF said.On Wednesday morning, Islamic Jihad announced that “a round of confrontations” had ended with Israel, according to the militant group’s spokesperson Tariq Selmi.Israeli military spokesperson Richard Hecht said there was no official ceasefire with Hamas but “messages have been passed.”Earlier, the Israeli military said that after an assessment of the situation, “and following the directives of the Home Front Command, it was decided to return to the normal routine fully.”Adnan, 45, had been on hunger strike since his arrest on February 5 and was found dead in his cell on Tuesday, according to the Israeli Prison Service.Adnan had been detained at least 11 times since 2004 and his repeated arrests and prolonged hunger strikes had made him a symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli detention policies.His death sparked anger in the West Bank, with protests, a general strike and other Palestinian detainees staging a hunger strike.The IDF said the Israeli military would hold Hamas responsible for “all terror activities emanating from the Gaza Strip and it will face the consequences of the security.”On Wednesday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said a 58-year-old Palestinian man was killed and five others injured in Gaza during the overnight hostilities.Earlier Tuesday in the Israeli city of Sderot, three people were wounded by shrapnel, with one man suffering serious injuries, emergency services said.Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has been in touch with Egypt, Qatar and the UN about the strikes, according to a Hamas statement early Wednesday morning.“Haniyeh holds the occupation responsible for the consequences of continuing this brutal aggression,” the statement read.Adnan is at least the seventh Palestinian detainee to die on hunger strike in an Israeli prison since 1970, the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society told CNN.Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh accused Israel of carrying out a “deliberate assassination… by refusing his request to release him, neglecting him medically and keeping him in his cell despite the seriousness of his health condition.”Israel has not yet returned Adnan’s body to his family, his lawyer Jamil Al Khatib told CNN by phone. His family has requested that there should not be an autopsy and that the body be given to the family for burial, the lawyer added.Adnan’s widow pleaded for non-violence in the wake of his death.“Not a drop of blood was spilled during the prisoner’s previous hunger strikes, and today we say with the rise of the martyr and his accomplishment of what he wished for, we do not want a drop of blood to be spilled,” Randa Musa said, adding that it was too late for arms to help him.",world,0.0

Adnan’s widow, however, called for calm in the wake of her husband’s death.He was found dead in his cell following his almost 3-month hunger strike, the prison service added.The Palestinian Prisoners Society also announced Adnan’s death, saying “the Israeli occupation assassinated Sheikh Khader Adnan.”Islamic Jihad announced a posthumous promotion for him to commander, saying “Khader Adnan rose as a martyr in a crime for which the Zionist occupation bears full and direct responsibility.”The Iranian-backed Palestinian militant group is responsible for the killings of scores of people in Israel in suicide bombings and rocket attacks.He was detained in February on suspicion of membership in a terrorist organization, support for terrorism and incitement, Israeli authorities said. He had not been tried at the time of his death.Following news of his death, Palestinian political parties announced a general strike in the West Bank in mourning for Adnan, with the shuttering of courts, schools, universities and shops.Palestinian detainees in Ofer Prison, an Israeli military prison in the West Bank, began a general hunger strike to protest his death, the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society said.Adnan was from Jenin in the occupied West Bank. Video from Jenin showed one of his sons protesting over his father’s death during a protest.Adnan’s widow pleaded for non-violence in the wake of his death. “Not a drop of blood was spilled during the prisoner’s previous  hunger strikes, and today we say with the rise of the martyr and his accomplishment of what he wished for, we do not want a drop of blood to be spilled,” Randa Musa said, adding that it was too late for arms to help him.Addressing Palestinian militant factions directly, she said weapons had not freed him: “Whoever has the weapon should have used it before the sheikh died, but now we don’t need this weapon.”She spoke before a stream of rockets shot from Gaza. At least 22 rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel, the Israel Defense Forces said. Four were intercepted by Israel’s Aerial Defense Array and 16 fell in open areas, the Israeli military added. It did not account for the other launches.At least three people were injured by shrapnel in the Israeli city of Sderot after the rockets were fired, emergency services said.The three were foreign workers on a building site, Magen David Adom said. One of the victims was in serious condition, and two others were in mild condition, MDA said. All three were taken to Barzilai hospital.Israel Police identified at least five locations where rockets landed, the Israel Police spokesperson’s unit said. Three were in Sderot and two others were in nearby communities.The reports came as the IDF instructed Israelis who live near Gaza to remain near designated shelters.A source in the Gaza Strip, which is run by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, said earlier that security and military sites were being evacuated in anticipation of Israeli response.Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh accused Israel of carrying out a “deliberate assassination… by refusing his request to release him, neglecting him medically and keeping him in his cell despite the seriousness of his health condition.”Israel has not yet returned Khader Adnan’s body to his family, his lawyer Jamil Al Khatib told CNN by phone. His family has requested that there should not be an autopsy and that the body be given to the family for burial, the lawyer said.Adnan first gained international attention for a 66-day hunger strike that ended in February 2012, which was at the time the longest known hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee in Israeli prisons.According to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society, he has been arrested at least 11 times since 2004 and held five hunger strikes. In 2015, he went on hunger strike for 55 days before Israeli authorities released him.Adnan spent a total of eight years in Israeli jails, mostly under administrative detention, a controversial Israeli military procedure that allows authorities to hold detainees indefinitely on security grounds. The process also allows for detention based on secret evidence, and there is no requirement to charge the detainees or to allow them to stand trial.His hunger strikes from jail became a rallying cry for Palestinians, who staged multiple rallies of support in the West Bank and Gaza.Israel has 4,900 Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons, with 1,000 of them being held in administrative detention without charge – the highest number since 2003, according to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society.Adnan is at least the seventh Palestinian detainee to die on hunger strike in an Israeli prison since 1970, the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society told CNN.

It needs to be a sign of our pride, our heritage and our culture,” said Mothusi Kamanga, a lawyer and activist in Johannesburg who has promoted an online petition, which has gathered about 8,000 signatures, for the diamond to be returned.“I think generally the African people are starting to realize that to decolonize is not just to let people have certain freedoms, but it’s also to take back what has been expropriated from us.”Officially known as Cullinan I, the diamond in the scepter was cut from the Cullinan diamond, a 3,100 carat stone that was mined near Pretoria.A smaller diamond cut from the same stone, known as Cullinan II, is set in the Imperial State Crown which is worn by British monarchs on ceremonial occasions. Along with the scepter, it is kept with the other crown jewels in the Tower of London.A replica of the whole Cullinan diamond, which is about the size of a man’s fist, is displayed at the Cape Town Diamond Museum.“I believe it should be brought back home because at the end of the day, they took it from us while they were oppressing us,” said Johannesburg resident Mohamed Abdulahi.Others said they didn’t feel strongly about it.“I don’t think it matters anymore.

Due to the intensity of the violence, UNICEF was unable to confirm the estimates, she added.Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) warned on Wednesday that people trapped in battlefields are running out of water and food.“Families across Sudan, including those of our colleagues, are being torn apart, and having to choose between remaining trapped in the battlefield, or risking their lives to flee or reach an overcrowded hospital,” Egeland said in a statement.“They are running out of everything, including water, food, electricity, fuel, and cash. We need the international community to put as much effort into secure humanitarian access, regardless of ceasefire and in providing aid to millions of people as they have in evacuating their own citizens,” he added.The violence has triggered a mass exodus of refugees from Sudan, with the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) on Thursday warning that $445 million is needed to help the 860,000 refugees and returnees who could escape the country by October.According to a UNHCR statement, the plan was designed by “134 partners, including UN agencies, national and international NGOS and civil society groups” and includes a contingency strategy for new arrivals (refugees, returning refugees and others) to neighbouring countries.”At the same time, hundreds of evacuees arrived from Sudan in Nigeria on Wednesday after being held up for days at the Egyptian border for days, as reports over the chaotic border response to the uptick in evacuees continue.The first contingent of 376 Nigerians were flown home in a military aircraft and a local carrier and arrived in the capital Abuja shortly before midnight, according to the Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM).Last week, more than 7,000 Nigerian nationals, mostly students fleeing the Sudan conflict had been left stranded at the Egyptian border due to the unavailability of visas, NIDCOM said while appealing to Egyptian authorities “to kindly allow the already traumatized travellers to transit to their final destinations.”",world,0.0

Nor has he been able to convey a successful strategy to stop the violence, he added.Lasso faces an impeachment vote in the next few weeks over accusations of embezzlement before he took office by opposition legislators – allegations Lasso denies.It was not always so hard for the self-made millionaire, who ran on a platform of liberal values before coming into power in 2021, promising more foreign direct investment and encouragement of entrepreneurship. He was lauded for a successful Covid-19 vaccination drive at the start of his term, enjoying high approval ratings at the time.It went downhill soon after.Lasso survived an impeachment attempt amid weeks-long protests over rising fuel and food prices last year, and his name emerged in the “Pandora Papers,” a 2021 expose of financial secrets and offshore dealings of dozens of heads of state and public officials.Ecuadoran law prohibits public servants from holding assets in tax havens. Lasso told Ecuador’s legislative commission investigating him that he had not evaded taxes and that his tax trajectory was legally supported. The investigation was later closed by the comptroller’s office.But opposition lawmakers have renewed their efforts to impeach him, and the President’s popular support is evaporating as crime skyrockets.The dramatic rise in crime that has fueled anger at his government is a trend that predated his presidency. Before Lasso took office, Ecuador had already become a key transit hub for cocaine due to its location between Peru and Colombia, and the dollarization of its economy in 2000 made it an easy location to launder money, say analysts.But the controls needed to stop organized crime were kneecapped by austerity measures put in place by his predecessor, Lenin Moreno, that led to massive layoffs in the public sector and budget cuts, Ortiz told CNN.“The judicial system, the institution that oversees bank transfers and bank transactions – they don’t even have money to make photocopies, much less track transactions that could potentially be linked to organized crime,” he said.Allegations of corruption have also marred the courts and police, with the US withdrawing visas from high-ranking officers of Ecuadorian state security forces, alleged to be linked to drug trafficking, and several judges and lawyers.Lasso, who has a weak mandate in Congress and has struggled to build coalitions, has implemented several states of emergencies to tamp the bloodletting in the country, which has seen hundreds killed in brutal prison riots between rival gangs, to very little success, say critics.His approach has become more haphazard following the second impeachment attempt. Last week, he declared organized criminal groups as terrorists, a move that empowered the military in pursuing gangs – despite allegations of corruption that cloud the security forces.His embrace of his predecessor’s austerity package has seen Lasso incentivize the private sector to step in on security issues, which Ortiz described as being a disaster.This includes Lasso’s recent authorization of civilians to use guns, a move which saw “private security companies (becoming) the first to raise their hand to say: ‘hey, no way, what we are seeing right now is criminals are more equipped than police,’” Ortiz said.The mood further soured against Lasso this year when Ecuadorian media accused the president’s brother-in-law Danilo Carrera of corruption, including a cash for executive positions scheme and fake energy contracts. Ecuadorian prosecutors had opened an investigation into the fake energy contracts in January.Following the report, Lasso asked prosecutors to investigate Carrera over his business and personal relationship with Ruben Cherres – whom authorities sought to arrest but was found murdered in late March. Lasso has rejected the existence of a corruption structure or network in his government.CNN has reached out to Carrera for comment. In a letter sent to local media in January, Carrera’s lawyers rejected allegations that he was the leader of a corruption scheme in public companies. He also denied claims that he had obtained illegitimate benefits for himself or third parties.The center-right leader is one of the few friends Washington has in the region, but even that relationship may be fraying.While several US senators have lauded Lasso, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted the US’s strong partnership with the country during a 2021 visit. But in April, a group of eight US Congressmembers sent a letter to US President Joe Biden urging him to “re-evaluate our government’s close relations with the Lasso government” and look into the corruption allegations surrounding Lasso and his associates.Lasso would be replaced by Vice President Alfredo Borrero if impeached, but he suggested to the Financial Times in April that it won’t get that far, saying he would invoke a constitutional clause that would force elections for his role and congress.The gambit would see Lasso rule by presidential decree and hold elections in six months’ time, and critics can see why Lasso might be tempted to opt for the nuclear option.“If the opposition’s got the 92 votes that they need to get rid of him, he’s going to press that button and give himself six months to find a way out,” said Guillaume Long, a former foreign minister for Ecuador who is now a senior policy analyst at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.If early elections are triggered, the 67-year-old Lasso has said he will run again despite losing a lot of political capital. In February, opposition parties won key mayoral positions in Quito and Guayaquil and a Lasso-backed referendum on eight reforms, including allowing the extradition of criminals, failed.As the clock runs on Lasso’s next move, violence and economic insecurity are leading more Ecuadorians to leave the country, with statistics showing thousands making their way north through the treacherous Darien Gap this year.",politics,0.0
32,32,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/americas/canada-china-michael-chong-intl/index.html,"Canada says ‘all options on table’ over claims China tried to interfere in election, harass lawmaker",2023-05-05 02:25:00,"Canada and China have become embroiled in a fresh diplomatic row after Ottawa summoned Beijing’s ambassador to respond to allegations that Beijing tried to intimidate a Canadian politician and interfere in its elections.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly announced the summoning of the ambassador Thursday, adding that Canada was considering taking retaliatory action over the allegations, which China vigorously denies.“All options are on the table,” Joly said – including diplomatic expulsions.Joly’s comments to members of parliament came during a heated exchange with opposition lawmaker Michael Chong – the alleged target of the intimidation, who has in recent days heavily criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government for what he sees as their slow response to the allegations.The news follows revelations, first reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) found an accredited Chinese diplomat in the country had targeted Chong and his relatives in China following his criticisms of Beijing’s treatment of its Uyghur minorities.The intelligence service also said that Beijing had tried to sway the outcome of Canada’s federal elections in 2019 and 2021.China on Thursday insisted the claims were “totally groundless,” accused the Canadian media and politicians of “spreading disinformation,” and warned Canada against going “further down the wrong and dangerous path.”During the summons, China’s Ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu “protested strongly” against the “threat to expel the relevant Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel based on rumors of so-called ‘China interference’ hyped up by some Canadian politicians and media,” according to a statement from the Chinese embassy.“China’s diplomatic and consular officials’ normal performance (daily activities) must not be smeared, and China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests must not be violated,” Cong said.He told Canadian officials at the meeting “to immediately stop this self-directed political farce” and warned that China would “play along every step of the way until the end” should the Canadian side continue to “make provocations.”China’s Consulate-General in Toronto meanwhile expressed “strong dissatisfaction” and “firm opposition” to the summoning of the ambassador, and insisted its officers had never engaged in activities “inconsistent with their official capacities.”“The claim has no factual basis and is totally groundless,” the Consulate-General said in a statement.It accused some Canadian media and politicians of “spreading disinformation with intent to damage the reputation and image of the Chinese Consulate-General” and “maliciously disrupt normal exchange and cooperation between the two sides.”Allegations of Chinese efforts to interfere in Canadian politics have been swirling for weeks, but reached a tipping point this week following the revelations by the Globe and Mail.According to the report, Chinese operatives tried to swing some local parliamentary races during national elections held in 2019 and 2021. However, the agency stopped short of alleging that China succeeded or in any way changed the outcome of those elections.The allegations also include claims that an accredited Chinese diplomat was involved in a plot to intimidate Chong in 2021 after he sponsored a motion in Canada’s parliament to condemn China’s treatment of Uyghur minorities, labeling their treatment by China genocide.Chong has described his apparent targeting as disturbing, but has also said it it not surprising – either for him or Canada’s large Chinese diaspora – and has focused much of his criticism on the Canadian government’s response, which he says has been too slow to act.In her comments to parliamentarians on Thursday, Joly said Canada’s government needed to carefully weigh how China might react.China would “of course” take action against Canada’s “economic interest, consumer interest and also diplomatic interests,” Joly said, adding that, “I know that we are under pressure to go fast, (but) we need to make sure as well that we protect our democracy.”Relations between Ottawa and Beijing have been tense in recent years.In one especially high-profile example, two Canadians – former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor – were detained by China for nearly three years.Their arrest on espionage charges in late 2018 came shortly after Canada arrested Chinese businesswoman and Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant related to the company’s business dealings in Iran.Beijing repeatedly denied that their cases were a political retaliation, but the two men were released on the same day Meng was allowed by Canada to return to China.Chong responded to Joly’s remarks by demanding Canada expel the diplomat regardless of any possible blowback from China.“If we do not take that course of action, minister, we are basically putting up a giant billboard for all the authoritarian states around the world that says we are open for foreign interference threat activities on Canadian soil targeting Canadian citizens and you can conduct these activities with zero consequences – and that’s why this individual needs to be sent packing,” Chong said.Chong and others say questions remain as to why the Trudeau government did not act sooner to acknowledge and act on the intelligence.“It’s astounding that the government hasn’t taken action to expel this individual,” Chong told a press briefing in Ottawa Tuesday.“And for the government of Canada to continue to accredit this individual and allow this individual to remain in Canada is a complete abdication of responsibility,” he added.Critics have also questioned why Chong and other politicians were not forewarned of the intelligence suggesting he had been targeted.While Trudeau was briefed on some of the intelligence agency’s findings, he said Tuesday at a press briefing that he had not been briefed specifically on the alleged targeting of Chong.Trudeau said he first heard this when it was reported in the media, as the spy agency had felt the intelligence was not significant enough to notify either the prime minister’s office or Chong himself.Trudeau said that reasoning was a mistake.“We’re making it very, very clear to CSIS and our intelligence officials that when there are concerns that talk specifically about any MP, or about their family, those need to be elevated, even if CSIS doesn’t feel that it’s a sufficient level of concern for them to take more direct action,” Trudeau said.Chong, a member of the opposition conservative party, has criticized Trudeau’s explanation as unacceptable, saying he and others in the Chinese community deserve to know if they are at risk.“I have not spoken to my family in China in years, I like many, many Canadians across the country whose family lives in authoritarian states have had to face the difficult dilemma of how to protect the family in these authoritarian states,” Chong said, adding that the Chinese diplomat who allegedly targeted him still lives and works in Canada and enjoys diplomatic immunity.Chong and other opposition party politicians are not the only ones demanding a tough response from Ottawa.Among the voices calling for retaliation is Dennis Molinaro, a former national security adviser and now a professor of legal studies at Ontario Tech University.“(Canada) really has to be following the American model in terms of more aggressively pursuing action against China when China is engaged in these actions that are direct threats to Canadian sovereignty,” he told CNN in a telephone interview Wednesday.“I think the Canadian public is aware of that now and recognizes that and supports a lot tougher action in terms of Canada protecting itself from these kinds of threats,” he added.",world,0.0

It is the only Indonesian province officially practicing Sharia law, enforced by religious police officers known as the Wilayatul Hisbah, and outlaws homosexuality, adultery, alcohol and gambling.The police chief said Risby-Jones would have a choice over whether to be prosecuted under Sharia law or provincial law. If found guilty under Sharia law he faces the possibility of 40 lashes and up to 2.5 years jail.

Everest Monday May 1,” it said. “Our deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends.“The Embassy is in contact with Dr. Sugarman’s family and with local authorities. Out of respect for the family’s privacy, we cannot comment further,” read a statement sent to CNN by an Embassy spokesperson.Spring is the most popular time to climb Mount Everest with most climbers aiming to ascend the peak in May.There’s a brief window of time – usually after mid-May – when temperatures are warmer, and the high-altitude winds known as the jet stream have moved away from the mountains.The climbers, along with staff members and Sherpa guides, spend nearly two weeks hiking to the Everest base camp, which sits at an altitude of around 17,000 feet (almost 5,200 meters).These warmer conditions and the record number of climbers this year, had raised concerns among mountaineers about dangerous overcrowding at the summit.A picture taken by climber Nirmal Purja showing a dense trail of people huddling on an exposed ridge to the mountain’s summit in May 2019 went viral. He told CNN at the time that there were roughly 320 people in a line to the top in an area known as the “death zone.”To avoid overcrowding, Nepali authorities say they are setting up ropes wherever possible.“The geography we can’t change… but we are trying to manage by adding multiple ropes,” Yubaraj Khatiwada, the director of Nepal’s Tourism Department, told CNN.Three Sherpas died last month after being buried by a block of snow on Everest, according to the official. The trio were delivering materials to construct and clear a route to be used by climbers to get to the top of the mountain.Nepal is home to eight of the 10 highest mountains in the world, so mountaineering is a significant source of revenue for Sherpas, despite the risks associated with climbing Everest.",travel,0.0
39,39,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/classic-italian-dishes/index.html,Italian food: Classic dishes everyone needs to try,2023-05-07 06:05:00,"Think of Italy and you’re likely to think of food first and all the beautiful places to see second.Italian cuisine – or some version of it – has colonized the rest of the world so successfully that there are probably uncharted corners of the Amazon rainforest where you can sit down at a red-and-white checkered tablecloth and order up a plate of pasta and sauce.There’s a reason the food is so good. Actually, there are hundreds of reasons scattered throughout the different regions of Italy. If you can’t get to them all, here are some top classics:Italy’s gift to TV box set bingers, deadline busters and delivery scooter manufacturers needs no introduction. Pizzas can be summoned to almost anywhere on the planet – including an intercity train – within 30 minutes provided there’s a phone connection and worthwhile tip.But that greasy slice you’re eating out of a box (for breakfast? Seriously?) is a far cry from the real thing. A true Italian pizza is thick, tender and has an elasticity when chewed. It’s traditionally dressed with fresh tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, basil leaves and melting mozzarella or fior di latte cheese – or simply plain white pizza. The most savory is buffalo milk mozzarella.Many atrocities have been committed in the name of pizza science – hot dog-stuffed crust anyone? Or pineapple pizza? But the original still never tastes better than in Naples, the city of its birth.The rest of the world calls it “spaghetti bolognese.” But the rest of the world is wrong. This perfect blend of delicate ragù sauce and fresh golden tagliatelle pasta is a signature of the northern Emilia Romagna region, in particular the city of Bologna. Hence the global name.Legend has it the tagliatelle shape was inspired by the curly blond hair of fearsome 16th-century Italian noblewoman Lucrezia Borgia. The ragù is made with finely chopped or ground pieces of pork and beef mixed with celery, carrots, onions, tomato sauce and red wine.Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is grated on top, like a snow-capped peak. The original ancient recipe is protected by the Azdore, “pasta priestesses” who prepare fresh tagliatelle for clients each day across the region at fresh pasta boutiques.Few ingredients go into making this dish, but the secret is in their quality and the way they stick to the tube shaped pasta. Pecorino cheese, pork cheek and raw organic eggs are all that’s needed for Rome’s specialty dish.Being a heavy and protein-rich meal, it’s usually served at dinner. The homemade rigatoni, must be “al dente” – cooked to exactly the point when it’s neither soft nor hard– so the dense egg-rich dressing clings without leaking into the plate. Spaghetti can also be used, preferably the homemade type with a gritty surface.Carbonara may owe its creation to American influence – it’s likely that pasta with egg and bacon flourished with the arrival of the American troops in Italy during World War II – but Romans, and Italians in general, like to stick to an indigenous tale according to which the dish was a favorite of charcoal burners working on the cold Apennine Mountains.The word pesto literally means “crush” in Genoese. In this case, basil, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, pine kernels, garlic cloves, coarse salt and extra virgin olive oil, pulverized together in a Genoese marble mortar. They combine to create a dense, creamy sauce that smells of a Mediterranean garden and cries out to be stirred through a bowl of handmade trofie pasta twists.This dish is at its best in Genoa, in northwestern Liguria, a land of seafarers and adventurers. The region was a spice trade hub in the Middle Ages, when use of herbs and flowers to flavor food became commonplace.A legacy of these times, pesto flourished in the 1800s based on an earlier, older recipe made with garlic called “agliata.”Freezer-ready superstore versions of this classic – more suited to propping open doors or breaking windows – have done it few favors over the years. But if made well with rich layers of ragù, béchamel sauce and Parmigiano cheese oozing between hand-made “sfoglia” sheets of fresh flat pasta, it’s still heavenly.Eaten via recipes that use either spinach or tomatoes, lasagne is closely linked to the northern city of modern Bologna, but it traces its origins to Roman times.It was, reputedly, philosopher Cicero’s favorite because its refinement and softness was easier to digest than many others found his outspoken beliefs. He’s said to have gulped down huge quantities up until he was killed.Solo diners should avoid ordering this dish, unless they’re: A) really hungry. B) massively into fish. Brodetto is a fish soup of gigantic proportions. It’s served as a single main course but usually takes two people to finish.Ray, mullet, sole, redfish and prawns gaze up from the bubbling pot, swimming in a pool alongside semi-ripe tomatoes, parsley and garlic. Grilled bread slices are dropped in before the eating starts and left to absorb the fishy liquid.Once all the fish is gone, it’s time to devour the soaked bread. At the very end, thin spaghetti, called capelli d’angelo (or angel hair), is thrown inside the pot and mixed with the remaining sea broth.It’s a topsy-turvy meal typical of Vasto on the Adriatic coast.Handmade pasta shaped like knots are stuffed with pork loin, ham, Mortadella salami, Parmigiano cheese, eggs and nutmeg and thrown in a thick capon broth.Spurious legend has it that a voyeuristic innkeeper in Bologna was peeking through a keyhole to spy on Venus, Mars and Bacchus in the middle of a hot and heavy threesome. He caught just a glimpse of the goddess’ perfect belly button and tried to reproduce it in pasta form.Voila! Tortellino was born.The original recipe is protected by the Confraternity of Tortellino, die-hard purists who don’t tolerate creative twists.Many towns in the Emilia Romagna region claim to be the originators of this staple dish, but there’s staunch rivalry between three: Modena, Bologna and Castelfranco Emilia, a small town halfway between them.Yes, we know that “genuine” gelato places have opened in your neighborhood. And we know it’s good.But it’s still not as good as the stuff you can eat anywhere in Italy, with warm evening sun on your face and an orchestra of ancient Vespas revving in the background.Gelato is said to have been inspired by ancient Sicilians, who mixed fruit juice with snow from Mount Etna. Today, recipes call for milk, cream, sugar and eggs.Traditional local flavors include pistachios, toasted almonds, nuts, lemons, mandarin oranges, figs and cactus figs.It can be savored on its own or together with a brioche bun as the Sicilians do. Bun pieces are used to scoop the gelato, which can also be spread inside like a peanut butter sandwich.This dish is made from dried fish.No, stay with us! This isn’t the gelatinous reconstituted fish of Scandinavian nightmares. This is a far more delicious proposition.The secret is in the preparation – a recipe invented by merchants from Vicenza in the 1500s and protected by a brotherhood of chefs. Dried cod is softened by beating and then placed under running water for two days. Then extra virgin olive oil, milk, Parmigiano, onions and anchovies are added and cooked slowly so that the ingredients penetrate into each other.It’s said that while savoring it, your mouth should feel the living fish still swimming in the ocean, a scenario which, we admit, is slightly nightmarish.This dish of boiled cornmeal mush is best served as a steaming semi-liquid on a wooden platter. It can also be cooled, solidified, chopped into fingers and served grilled as rectangular finger foods.Once a peasant dish believed to have aphrodisiac powers, it’s a great gluten-free substitute for bread. Having a neutral flavor, it’s good with everything: rabbit, mushrooms, braised veal with tomato sauce and milk. Even Nutella.This fried, crispy golden globe artichoke, which makes a crunchy sound with each bite, is a delicacy of Rome’s Jewish quarter.The criteria for selection is strict. Only the best variety are chosen. They’re 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) wide, twice the normal size, and grow on the uppermost part of the plant that’s absorbed the most sunlight.Once the rough leaves are delicately trimmed with a cobbler’s knife, the artichoke is dipped twice in frying oil at different temperatures. Served as an appetizer, sometimes upside down with the stem in the air, overspilling the plate like a blooming flower.It’s an Italian staple with an exotic taste. This creamy rice dish gets its golden color and soft texture from saffron. That’s why it’s also called risotto allo zafferano, although the Milanese call it by the more prosaic name, risotto giallo.Local carnaroli or arborio rice is cooked with veal broth, butter, Grana Padano cheese and sometimes bone marrow. The secret to making a great risotto alla Milanese lies in giving the rice time to absorb the flavors.As always, there’s a backstory. This one centers on a Dutch artist who, at a posh dinner while he was on assignment decorating the windows of Milan’s Duomo cathedral, served up a rice dish including the saffron he was using as a yellow dye. It proved an instant hit.Don’t freak out if on your tour of Sardinia you come across village food fairs where baby piglets are staked and cooked over a bonfire. It’s all perfectly normal around these parts, and if you like meat and you’re not squeamish, we’re sorry to report that crunchy piglet is delicious.Porceddu (meaning piglet in Sardinian) is a dish of baby pig that has fed solely on its mother’s milk and weighs less than 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds). That ensures the meat is tender and has a less pungent taste.Once killed, it’s roasted for hours in public squares and prepared in a variety of ways. While cooking, drops of liquid lard are poured over the piglet to make it crunchier and tastier. When ready to be served, it can be glazed with honey and sprinkled with herbs.Preparing it is a spectacle, and the secret to making a great crunchy porceddu lies in skillful rotation of the gigantic skewer so that the outer skin is crispy but not burned while the meat remains tender.Amatriciana sauce was born in the town of Amatrice, a town in Italy’s central Lazio region, when a local recipe was adapted after tomatoes were brought here following the discovery of America.Since adopted as a Rome classic, its secret lies in choosing the right kind of pasta – and none does it better than bombolotti.These thick, wide macaroni have ridges that trap the sauce made from premium tomatoes, fried crispy pork cheek and a topping of grated savory Roman pecorino cheese. True to its name, the bombolotti explodes deliciously in the mouth at first bite.Sweet-tasting veggies are not something typically ordered in Italy, but this extravagant Sicilian concoction will win anyone over. It’s a sweet and sour mix of different vegetables dressed in a sauce of tomato extract, onions, celery, capers and olives.There are many caponata variations, but most use small potatoes, eggplant and bell peppers cooked with almonds, pine nuts, raisins, sugar, vinegar, extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil.It’s no shock that a country famous for its desserts and famous for its coffee would find a way to combine them so sublimely. What is a shock is that this glorious combination was supposedly conjured up in a brothel.Tiramisù is concocted of layers of Savoiardi ladyfinger biscuits dipped one by one in a whipped mixture of mascarpone cream cheese and a fine blend of different coffee powders. Chocolate powder is also sometimes added, but purists like to stick to just coffee.It’s traditionally made in large trays and served in rectangular portions like lasagne.The name tiramisù literally means “lift me up” or “pull me up” – a reference to the restorative powers it apparently bestowed upon customers of brothels in the northern city of Treviso, allowing them to spend more money.Can’t cook but want to learn to prepare great Italian food? Start here. This symbol of the Mediterranean diet is made simply by alternating slices of fresh tomatoes and mozzarella cheese dressed with extra virgin oil, salt, pepper and fresh basil leaves.The white of the mozzarella juxtaposed with the red of the tomato and the green of the basil is said to represent the Italian flag. Its birthplace is believed to be the chic island of Capri. Insalata Caprese means “salad made the Capri-way.”Meat addicts will love this dish originating from the northern region of Piedmont. Bollito simply means “the boil” and is a feast of various meats. One single dish holds boiled pieces of seven different beef cuts plus parts of other animals: calf’s head, chuck steak, ox tongue, ox tail, flank; one whole capon and one cotechino pork sausage.Carrots, onions, fresh rosemary, celery, garlic, salt and pepper are added to spice up this butcher’s platter. The meat can then be dipped in a variety of bittersweet sauces.The trick is all in the timing and temperature. The longer the meats are boiled, the tastier they get, but there’s a risk of destroying the flavor through overboiling.Meaning “sea rock” in Italian, scoglio is a name that suits this dish of linguine entwined with calamari, clams, mussels, shrimp and baby prawns and dressed with chili pepper, parsley, tomatoes and a glug of white wine.It’s a seafood pasta recipe hailing back to the ancient fishing traditions when families living along the coast ate their evening pasta with the fresh daily catch.Linguine, aka “small tongues,” is a flat thin noodle ideal for seafood dishes. This dish resembles shoreline rocks after crashing waves have left behind a handful of marine life. The original recipe comes from Naples but has extended to most southern cities. In Rome, it’s also served wrapped in tinfoil.Not to be tackled for lunch unless there’s room for an afternoon nap, this tasty dish is an oozing stratification of fried eggplant slices, Pachino tomato sauce, eggs, fresh basil and caciocavallo or fior di latte cheese.The best eggplants are the oval, dark purple, fat ones ideal for frying. They can also be topped with grated, smoked ricotta.Despite the name, it has nothing to do with northern town of Parma but comes from deepest Sicily and is a popular dish mainly in southern Italy.This dish is what happens when you let oxtail stew for hours in a huge pan of celery, carrots, onions and a liter of red wine. The best versions take two days, with ingredients simmered slowly over a low flame until the meat falls away from the bone at the touch of a tongue.At the end of the meal, grilled bruschetta slices are often dipped in the pan to mop up the remaining carrots, oxtail and celery sauce. This typical Roman dish, usually savored during festivities, is so tender it melts in the mouth.Italians don’t usually like to mix meat and fish, but there are a few exceptions. One is vitello tonnato, aka veal covered in tuna cream.This unusual concoction sees boiled veal fillets sliced into circles and covered in a dense layer of mayonnaise mixed with shredded tuna, anchovies and capers. The concoction is typically served cold as an appetizer.It’s a specialty of the Piedmont region, which bears the influence of past French conquerors.Malloreddus are tiny, shell-shaped, durum-wheat flour pasta that are served with a sauce of onions, sausage ragù (preferably flavored with fennel) or dried salami and dressed with salty Sardinian pecorino cheese. Basil can also be added.The sauce gets trapped inside the malloreddus’ tiny pockets. Local lore has it that the name of the pasta in regional dialect means “little bulls” as their shape reminded shepherds of calves. It’s a classic main course from Sardinia’s southwest Campidano area.Tasty Roman pecorino cheese, blended with sprinkled black pepper, melts as soon as it mixes with the thick, curly tonnarelli spaghetti freshly pulled out of a pot of boiling water.The secret to making a great sauce is adding teaspoons of hot salty water from the boiling pasta pot to help the ingredients blend in a creamy, slightly adhesive sauce that sticks easily to the tonnarello.Cheese fanatics tend to add an extra layer of grated pecorino to make it even tastier. It’s a simple Rome signature dish, found at typical trattoria.Those with a sweet tooth will adore this top Neapolitan pastry, which is fun to eat. There are two types of sfogliatella. The riccia, meaning “curly,” is shaped like a shell and has crunchy layers of puff pastry stuffed with fresh sweet ricotta cheese, crushed candied orange bits, vanilla and cinnamon. It’s sprinkled with sugar.When its corner is bitten off, the pastry unravels like woolen yarn exposing the inner filling.Ffrolla sfogliatella is roundish and stuffed with the same ingredients but wrapped in shortcrust pastry.Local poets have written sonnets praising the delicious taste of these “two sisters.” It’s a street food sweet treat. In Naples, pastry stands sell sfogliatelle freshly made each day.These handmade ravioli are stuffed with mashed potatoes, chopped mint, garlic and grated Sardinian pecorino cheese. They’re best savored straight, “in white” with no added sauce but just a bit of extra virgin olive oil or grated tuna eggs (bottarga). They’re laid out on the plate to form a blossoming flower.Culurgiones are also eaten with tomato sauce and fresh basil. Hand-shaping them can be tricky; it takes time to learn how to properly do it.Once the ingredients are wrapped inside the dough, the borders are pinched together to form little lines resembling wheat spikes. A typical dish from Sardinia’s Ogliastra region, in the past it was prepared as a festive treat to celebrate grain harvest, a sort of local Thanksgiving food.Hand-made squared ravioli with zig-zag edges filled with roasted meat, these are usually eaten either with veal broth, a rich meat sauce or with butter and sage.Being a highly nutritious dish, it’s usually served at dinner and on special occasions. While the agnolotti are cooking, a glass of red wine can be poured over them to enhance the flavor. A thin layer of grated Parmigiano cheese is added at the end as topping. Plin is the final “pinch” given to close an agnolotto.In the past, farming families ate them without any sauce to best savor the Piedmont recipe’s ingredients.This succulent rice dish was born on the border between Lombardy and Piedmont. Gorgonzola blue cheese is an ideal dressing for risotto. It has a delicate taste when added to locally grown rice varieties such as carnaroli that absorb the flavors during cooking.To make it, rice is cooked with vegetable broth with morsels of Gorgonzola thrown in at the end, just before butter and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese are added. Black pepper is sprinkled on top.Nuts and pieces of special sausages from the Piedmont town of Bra made with a mix of veal and pig fat can also be added to the dish.Gorgonzola cheese was, apparently, created by mistake. It’s said that a young dairy man, eager to meet his girlfriend, forgot to finish his work and left the cheese pot outside. Instead of throwing away the almost rotten curd the next morning, he added a fresh layer. In between the two, green “parsley” looking veins of mold formed.Timballo is the art of recycling food leftovers from the day before or after a festive meal. It’s the Italian equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon pie. Anything can go inside to stuff the shortcrust pastry as long as it’s been previously cooked.Pasta, meat, cheese, vegetables, tortellini, eggs, sausages and even fish are mixed together with besciamella sauce and placed inside the dough, which is then folded and cooked in an oven.It’s mostly eaten in central and northern Italy, with family recipes passed down through generations. Timballo was invented as a way to conserve expensive ingredients and make meals last for days.",travel,0.0
40,40,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/nagoya-japan-things-to-do/index.html,Nagoya shakes off its rep as Japan’s ‘most boring city’,2023-05-06 21:30:00,"Nagoya is an industrial powerhouse of some 2.3 million people at the center of an urban metropolis of about 10 million in central Japan, about two-thirds of the way between the better-known cities of Tokyo and Osaka.Yet few international travelers visiting Japan experience it.Nagoya might not have the international draw of Tokyo, Kyoto or Osaka, but it certainly doesn’t deserve the sobriquet of “Japan’s most boring city.”The city and its surrounding region, known as Chukyo, are filled with a wealth of attractions. These include historical castles, delicious food, scenic rail journeys, exciting theme parks, a thriving local bar scene and some of Japan’s best museums.So why does it have a reputation amongst some Japanese residents for being dull? It reportedly all started in 2016, according to the Japan Times, when Nagoya wound up last on a survey asking residents in eight cities to select which ones were the most appealing as travel destinations.In the years since, the city has proven the opposite is true, according to Nagoya residents Lena Yamaguchi and Elisabeth Llopis.In 2020, the pair founded Nagoya Is not boring, a local tour company that aims to share their passion for the city with visitors.“Travelers can enjoy both traditional and modern in a compact size, and not only during the daylight, during which you can explore the many castles and temples and shrines of the area,” says Llopis. At night, she suggests visiting the local izakaya bars “to get a closer look at the local culture of the city.”One of Nagoya is not boring’s street food or sake night walking tours is a great introduction to the city. For travelers who prefer to explore on their own, the city is easily navigated with a maps app and a transit smartcard – almost every type in Japan is interchangeable, but the local ones are called Manaca and Toica.Here’s a closer look at what Nagoya has to offer first-time visitors.If you’ve traveled by Shinkansen bullet train between Tokyo and Osaka, you’ve passed through Nagoya, and might even remember the skyscraper district around its central railway station.Here you’ll find all the modern Japan you’d want, including a Takashimaya department store, a large BIC Camera outlet for electronics or the Hands (previously Tokyu Hands) craft and lifestyle store, a Uniqlo for Japan’s latest fashions, as well as hotels for every budget and at every altitude.For an inexpensive Japanese “business hotel,” there’s the cheap and cheerful, scrupulously clean Toyoko Inn chain, of which there are several within walking distance from the station.Nagoya’s also a great place for a splurge, perhaps at the Nagoya Marriott Associa in one of the skyscrapers directly above the main railway station, which offers incredible views over the city and, for railway lovers, views high over the tracks of the Shinkansen and local lines to give that real-life train diorama feeling.If you don’t want to splurge on the view from the Marriott, Starbucks fans have one to match in the outlet at the same JR Towers complex.The three skyscrapers feature an interlinked set of restaurant floors on the 12th and 13th floors, with 75 restaurants for every tastebud and budget that are a great introductory or exploratory experience.Two of the skyscrapers have cafés and restaurants with incredible panoramic views on the 51st or 52nd floors.Nagoya’s local food, Nagoya-meshi, symbolizes the city’s historical location both as a port and as part of the Tokaido road linking the capitals Kyoto and Edo (the former name for Tokyo).It’s incredibly varied, including everything from chicken wings and Italian fusion spaghetti to more adventurous dishes like raw chicken sashimi.Nagoya-mesh’s five characteristic styles are based on local red miso (hitsumabushi eel, miso katsu pork, miso nikomi udon noodles), the local kochin breed of chicken (tebasaki chicken wings and the toriwasa raw chicken sashimi), Italian fusion (teppan and ankake spaghetti), Asian fusion (like the kishimen, sugakiya and Taiwan-style ramen), and coffee shop menus (like ogura bean jam toast).Less panoramic than the towers’ restaurant floors, but more local, are the smaller eateries clustered in the Esca underground shopping mall, hidden beneath the western side of the station.Heading just a few hundred meters from the station, especially on the western side, visitors quickly go from 50-plus-floor skyscrapers to regular neighborhoods with typical Japanese houses and low-rise apartments. A wander around this area gives you a real feel of how everyday people live, with small local shops and restaurants.Of all of Japan’s beautiful castles, most are replicas, built in the traditional shape with modern materials after World War II.Nagoya Castle is one of the best examples of these, with its large main keeps rebuilt in concrete in the 1950s and now part of the museum complex that also includes the Nishinomaru Okura Museum, which opened in 2021. The city is in the process of rebuilding outer towers from original materials and continues to develop the castle precinct with cultural heritage and artifacts in mind.Only 12 castles across all of Japan remain standing in their original form, one of which is Inuyama Castle in the town of the same name in Nagoya’s northern suburbs, nestled in the foothills of the Japanese Alps.Just 45 minutes from Nagoya Station on the private (non-JR) Meitetsu railway, the area between Inuyama station and its castle has been sympathetically restored in recent years.The showpiece is the Honmachi-Dori shopping street, redesigned to reflect its history in the Showa era (1926-1989, the reign of the Showa emperor, known in the West by his birth name, Hirohito). Enjoy everything from traditional sweets to rental kimonos on your way to and from the castle.Younger visitors will also enjoy nearby Japan Monkey Park, a relatively tame but very typical Japanese-style theme park, with rides and a water park section.Nagoya and its surrounding towns are also home to some of Japan’s most interesting museums.Still in Inuyama, Meiji-mura is an open-air architectural museum on the shores of Lake Iruka that preserves buildings from the century of Japan’s rapid modernization that started in the Meiji period (1867-1912). The most famous is the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Imperial Hotel, but all are remarkable in their own way.Back in Nagoya, a few kilometers east of Nagoya Castle you’ll find the Tokugawa Art Museum, one of Japan’s finest private museums, which holds several National Treasures of Japan thanks to its connection with the Tokugawa clan dynasty. It sits within the beautiful Tokugawa-en Gardens, restored in 2004, itself well worth a visit.To the south of the city center, under half an hour from the main station on the private (non-JR) Aonami Line (which wends its way through Nagoya’s bustling port district), you’ll find both Legoland Japan and the SCMaglev and Railway Park train museum on the reclaimed island of Kinjofuto.Legoland features roller coasters and dozens of other attractions, including Lego brick reproductions of many Japanese landmarks, as well as the Sea Life Nagoya aquarium within the hotel.The SCMaglev and Railway Park, meanwhile, is one of Japan’s best railway museums, associated with the JR Central railway company that operated the original section of Shinkansen line west of Tokyo, as well as the one building the new 500 kilometers per hour superconducting maglev (magnetic levitation) Chuo Shinkansen line between Tokyo and Nagoya, which should open in 2027.The museum features everything from trial maglev trains all the way back to historical steam trains, and also offers simulators to try driving yourself. Visit on weekdays to avoid crowds, and get your name down for the simulator lottery early.If cars are your thing, then the Toyota Automobile Museum, about 45 minutes east of Nagoya Station, features some 140 historical vehicles. Get there via the funky Linimo, a local maglev transit system that was built to bring visitors to the 2005 Expo outside of Nagoya. There’s also the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology, a museum of manufacturing located a 20-minute walk north of Nagoya Station at the old headquarters of Toyota’s predecessor company.The Expo Park is a beautifully landscaped space that also features the brand-new Ghibli Park, of which Stage 1 is already finished. It’s very much a park — no rides or attractions — but the first three sections are already built and look like great fun for Studio Ghibli fans.Meanwwhile, the Noritake Garden museum and craft center, at the home of the Noritake ceramics company, is just a brisk 15-minute walk north of Nagoya Station and offers a china painting experience. There’s also a delightful French restaurant with a truly sublime afternoon tea service.And last, sports fans in the playing season must head out to the Vantelin Dome to watch the local baseball team, the Chunichi Dragons. Japanese baseball is a real trip even if you’re not a huge fan of the sport, and the experience here is not to be missed.",travel,0.0

42,42,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/faa-traffic-controllers-shortage/index.html,"Buttigieg says FAA is about 3,000 air traffic controllers short",2023-05-05 18:09:00,"Air traffic control in the United States is understaffed by about 3,000 positions, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN on Friday, as hiring to fill some of that gap opened.The Federal Aviation Administration ATC workforce currently numbers about 11,500 controllers, but “the optimal number is closer to about 14,500,” the secretary said on CNN News Central. The numbers are similar to the agency’s assessment this spring that about one in five controller positions nationwide are vacant.“We have thousands of controllers in training right now but also a number who are eligible to retire,” Buttigieg said.He spoke as the agency began hiring on Friday – targeting 1,500 new entry-level air traffic controllers this year – and published an annual report on the agency’s ATC workforce.That report showed the agency hired 1,026 controllers last year, just shy of its targets, acting FAA administrator Billy Nolen told Congress in a letter. The FAA also experienced more controllers leaving the job last year than it had planned, and is further short-staffed because the coronavirus pandemic “has resulted in delayed certification for most existing developmental controllers.”Recently, Nolen told reporters that the agency’s planned 3,300 hires in the next two years will mostly replace those who are retiring. About 500 of those hires will hold positions that are currently empty.Earlier this spring, the FAA asked airlines to dial back flights this summer in the New York metropolitan area, where a key radar facility is only 54 percent staffed. Airlines flying their planned summer schedules would cause a spike in delays due to the shortage, the FAA predicted.But Buttigieg argued that most delays travelers experience are not the cause of air traffic controller short-staffing.“Controller availability is not the cause of most cancelations and delays that we see,” he said in the CNN interview. “The (staffing) gaps that we’ve seen have built up over years. This is nothing that we can’t prepare for going into this summer. But this is part of why we’re working so hard to train new air traffic controllers.”Nolen wrote in a letter to Congress that “about 5 percent of delay minutes can be attributed to FAA staff shortages.”",politics,0.0

44,46,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/mona-lisa-bridge-scli-intl/index.html,Historian claims to have located mystery ‘Mona Lisa’ bridge,2023-05-05 04:01:00,"Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” is one of the best-known artworks in the world, famous for its beauty as well as the mystery surrounding the identity of the model and the location painted behind her.A source of debate for centuries, the village of Ponte Buriano, a suburb of Arezzo in the Tuscany region of Italy, is so convinced the bridge behind Mona Lisa is the Ponte Buriano that they’ve made it a key feature of their local tourism campaign, even laying claim to the bridge on the village’s welcome sign.But now, historian Silvano Vinceti says that the bridge behind Mona Lisa is actually the Romito Bridge in the nearby Tuscan town of Laterina.“The distinctive form of the Arno [River] along that stretch of territory corresponds to what Leonardo portrayed in the landscape to the left of the woman depicted in the famous painting,” Vinceti said at a media conference at the Foreign Press Association in Rome on Wednesday.Vinceti also made a virtual reconstruction of the bridge to show the similarities, and drew on documents from the state archives in Florence.The “Mona Lisa” was painted in the early 16th century.Between 1501 and 1503 Da Vinci lived with Cardinal Cesare Borgia near Laterina, Vinceti found. The bridge was in use and had four arches – as depicted in the artwork.On the other hand, the Buriano bridge has six arches, Vinceti said, and Ponte Bobbio, a bridge in Piacenza that some say features in the painting, has more than six arches.The Romito bridge linked Arezzo, Fiesole and Florence but is now in ruins. Vinceti said he studied drone images of the river banks, the ruins and photographs over the years to determine that the “Etruscan-Roman Romito bridge is unmistakably” the one in the background.Laterina mayor Simona Neri was also in attendance at the press conference and is excited about the prospect of claiming the bridge to bring tourists to her town of 3,500 people.“We really hope that this wonderful news will intrigue and fascinate local and foreign tourists, with the knowledge that it will be a great opportunity to relaunch the tourism of our territory on which we can work a lot starting from naturalistic, cultural and monumental valuation,” she said.“We need to try to protect what’s left of the bridge, which will require funding,” Neri said, noting that there are funds available for most areas tied to Da Vinci and other masters.“There’ll be some rivalry; we’ll need to put a poster up, too,” she added.Da Vinci’s 16th century masterpiece is now housed at the Louvre in the Paris, where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. But experts say it owes its global fame to the fact that it was stolen from the gallery by Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia in 1911, rather than any artistic singularity.“If a different one of Leonardo’s works had been stolen, then that would have been the most famous work in the world – not the ‘Mona Lisa,’” Noah Charney, professor of art history and author of “The Thefts of the Mona Lisa,” said in 2013, which marked the 100-year anniversary of when the painting was recovered.“There was nothing that really distinguished it per se, other than it was a very good work by a very famous artist – that’s until it was stolen,” he added. “The theft is what really skyrocketed its appeal and made it a household name.”",style,0.0

On Friday morning, dozens of firefighters in Fox Lake were battling the blazes, which burned nearly 11,000 acres, officials said.In Drayton Valley, firefighters, helicopters and air tankers battled an out-of-control fire that torched over 3,700 acres, according to Tucker.Authorities in the municipality of Yellowhead County and the town of Edson have also ordered an immediate evacuation due to wildfires burning in Alberta, Edson officials tweeted. The town of Edson has a population of just under 9,000 residents, according to the community’s website.On Friday night, Alberta officials expanded the mandatory evacuation order in Lac Ste. Anne County, which is about 50 miles northwest of Edmonton. Officials told residents evacuations could last up to three days.Portions of Big Lakes County – home to about 5,600 residents – were also ordered to evacuate, including residents east of the West Prairie River and Highway 749 and south of Township Road 724. It’s unclear how many people are affected by the evacuations.Officials asked Banana Belt residents to prepare “their properties by removing log piles, deadfall, and plowing around properties if possible.”“There is the potential for danger to life and health,” Big Lakes County officials said in a post.“Temperatures have been 10 to 15 degrees above normal for a little while now,” Tucker said. “We still don’t have green grass and leaves all over the province, which means that the ground is very dry.”The northern province has been experiencing extremely warm conditions and high winds, Tucker said, and residents are not allowed to have open woodfires on public or private lands while the fires are burning.There have been 348 wildfires in Alberta since January, burning more than 61,776 acres, Tucker said.“That’s significantly more wildfire activity this time of year than we’ve certainly seen any time in the recent past,” Tucker said.In northeastern British Columbia, the Peace River Regional District expanded its evacuation order for the Boundary Lake wildfire early Saturday.The BC Wildfire Service “continues to respond to the Boundary Lake wildfire located at the BC/Alberta border, east of #FortStJohn,” the agency tweeted, adding that the wildfire was estimated to cover 4,695 acres.“The area is being impacted by heavy smoke and visibility is poor. Aviation resources are currently being challenged by the poor visibility. Drivers are advised to avoid Highway 64 due to the poor visibility,” the BC Wildfire Service said.The initial evacuation order was “expanded as a result of aggressive fire behavior and the risk to life safety,” according to Peace River officials.The order includes areas on the east to the Alberta border and on the south to the south side of Imperial Avenue, district officials said.In southeastern British Columbia, a state of local emergency and evacuation orders were issued this week by the Regional District of Kootenay Boundary due to “the imminent danger of flooding to the life and property of persons resident or present.”“The #BCWildfire Service is prepared to support flood response across the province this weekend,” the agency tweeted Friday, adding that “20 personnel have deployed to the #CacheCreekBC area, 33 personnel are stationed in the #GrandForksBC region, and an additional 20 personnel are on standby to assist if needed.”",world,0.0
46,48,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/weather/may-snow-cold-great-lakes-northeast-wxn/index.html,Historic May storm brings snow and record cold temperatures to the Great Lakes,2023-05-01 13:49:00,"In the Midwest, the unofficial start to summer with barbecues seems a little far-fetched as people are still shoveling and having to clear snow off their grills before they even think about using them.Another late-season storm is bringing wintry conditions this week to parts of the Midwest and Ohio Valley. Heavy snow, torrential rain, gusty winds and possible record cold high temperatures will make for a pretty miserable start to the week weather-wise.Meteorologists from the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan, are describing the event as “a historic late spring snowstorm the likes of which we have not seen here in Upper Michigan since May of 1990.”Parts of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula have already seen up to 18 inches of snow and another two feet are possible through Tuesday.“Given the late-season event, surface temperatures hovering around freezing will lead to a very heavy, wet snow, which may result in downed trees and powerlines,” the Weather Prediction Center said.Along with heavy snow, winds will be gusting up to 50 mph across the Upper Midwest, which will add to the danger of falling trees.The reason is a strong area of low pressure, which has stalled out over the Great Lakes region. It is bringing strong effects, felt for a longer duration, simply because the storm is not moving.“Several locations (are) potentially approaching May monthly low-pressure records,” the prediction center mentioned in its forecast discussion.As barometric pressure drops, it can be an indication of how strong a storm is. In this case, the pressure over the Great Lakes is equivalent to a strong tropical storm or low-end Category 1 hurricane.The steady stream of strong winds will cause incredible wave heights across portions of the Great Lakes as well.“The strong north winds will cause waves to build into the 15 to 20 feet range along the shores of Lake Superior today into tonight resulting in possible lakeshore flooding for portions of eastern Marquette and Alger counties,” the weather service office in Marquette said.Flood watches are in effect across the region for not only the lakeshore flooding, but the additional river rise expected from snowmelt.Temperatures across the Midwest, Great Lakes and Ohio Valley are running 10 to 20 degrees below normal early this week and more than 60 cold temperature records could be broken.Here are a few cities expected to break records for cold high temperatures. All will experience temperatures more typical for early March:The system will finally push out by midweek, moving into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Wednesday. I know many of you in the Northeast are tired of rain, after the miserable and dreary weekend, but this week is unfortunately going to remain unsettled. Rain and normal temperatures will settle in.“Below-average temperatures will spill into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, with nighttime lows dipping into the low 40s across nearly the entirety of the I-95 urban corridor,” the prediction center said.Some of the higher elevations like the Pocono Plateau could even see a little snow.“If some wet flakes do mix in, no impacts are expected (besides asking yourself “isn’t it May?”),” the weather service office in New York City pointed out in its forecast discussion.For the rest of the Northeast, the precipitation type will be all rain, on top of what has already been a soaking weekend.Yesterday Portland, Maine set a new daily rainfall record after picking up 2.5 inches of rain. Central Park in New York City also broke a daily rainfall record on Saturday after recording 2.46 inches of rain.Much of the late-season misery should be pushed out by the second half of the week, nudging temperatures warmer and closer to where they should be this time of year, just in time for the weekend.",world,0.0
47,49,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/28/weather/tornado-facts-formation-supercell-xpn/index.html,How a thunderstorm can produce a tornado,2023-05-01 11:47:00,"Tornadoes are one of Earth’s most violent natural forces.They have whipped up in all 50 US states – and across the globe – at various times of year, sometimes causing untold devastation. But despite strides in their study, there’s still so much scientists don’t know about them.“There is no perfect formula for forming a tornado,” said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller, a storm chaser who’s has been following and studying these storms since 2005.“Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does. Conversely, tornadoes frequently form in marginal environments where it seems like one or more ‘ingredients’ to storm formation is missing or lacking,” he said.Still, there are some common factors anyone can look for to understand the life cycle of a developing storm that could produce a tornado. They are:In the developing phase of the thunderstorm, warm air rises and fluffy white cumulus clouds begin to grow.The clouds grow taller and taller, even before rain or thunder appears.Then, the bottom of the clouds darken and the very top could flatten out, creating a protruding anvil shape that indicates very cold air at the top and could be a precursor to hail.As warm as rises, cold air is pushed down. This results in wind speed and direction changing with height within the storm – a phenomenon called wind shear.Wind shear helps the storm begin to rotate and become what’s called a supercell.In this maturing phase, heavy rain, lightning, hail and very strong winds are expected.Sometimes, a strong gust of wind – called a gust front – blows a few moments before rain arrives. It’s caused by cool air being forced down from the storm cloud. When the cold air hits the ground, it spreads out quickly ahead of the storm and is a sure sign a storm is near.“Nearly all supercells produce some sort of severe weather (large hail or damaging winds) but only 30 percent or less produce tornadoes,” said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Tornadoes usually form from supercells when the right ingredients are in place to help them thrive:• instability in the atmosphere, which allows air to rise;• lift, the rising itself;• and most critically, wind shear: when winds at different heights within the supercell blow in different directions.The wind shear creates a horizontally rotating column of air within the thunderstorm cloud.Then, two key forces inside the supercell can act on the rotating air column:• the updraft – or the rising of warm air – lifts the horizontal air column,• while the downdraft – an area of drier air pushed down from the storm – twists the column so it’s vertical, then wraps around its backside.The resulting vertical column of air is called a funnel cloud until it touches the ground – when it becomes a tornado.“The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the ‘wall cloud,’” Miller said.The wall cloud is a lowering of the darkened cloud base that leads to the air rotation. While the presence of a wall cloud doesn’t always mean a tornado will form, it certainly ups the odds.“You will know you are looking at a wall cloud because it will hang noticeably lower than the rest of the thunderstorm, and you may notice it is rotating if you look closely,” Miller said.Tornadoes can disappear as quickly as they appear – often morphing from roaring funnels of fury into nothing in seconds – when a key ingredient is lost, Miller said.Sometimes as a thunderstorm evolves, its source of warm, moist air is cut off, causing a tornado to die, he said.Tornado-producing supercells also can merge with other storms, forming into a so-called “squall line,” which generally kills a tornado, Miller said. Squall lines, though, have their own dangers, including gusty winds that can stretch for hundreds of miles – and even spin up quick tornadoes of their own.",world,0.0

Estimates are based on damage to trees, institutional buildings and homes, making it harder to gauge tornadoes that leave little damage or happen in open space.The scale is named after Tetsuya “Ted” Fujita, an engineer and meteorologist who developed the original version of it in 1971.Here are the Enhanced Fujita Scale ratings used today by the National Weather Service and the kind of damage associated with each:These tornadoes are the least destructive and typically break tree branches, damage road signs and push over small, shallow-rooted trees.With similar wind speeds to weak hurricanes, these tornadoes can push moving cars off course, shift mobile homes from their foundations and remove roof surfaces.Significant damage starts to emerge from these tornadoes, which can snap or uproot trees, destroy mobile homes and tear roofs completely off homes.They also can pick up small objects and turn them into dangerous projectiles.These tornadoes produce severe damage, uprooting nearly all trees in their path, blowing over large vehicles like trains and buses and significantly damaging buildings.Less than 5% of all tornadoes are rated EF3 or higher.One such tornado in March 2022 struck near New Orleans, hitting Arabi, Louisiana, with 160-mph winds. At least one person was killed and eight hospitalized after the storm ripped through homes and businesses, leaving a trail of destruction.Easily destroying homes, tossing cars and downing large trees, these tornadoes can be devastating.One ripped through eastern Alabama in 2019 with top winds estimated at 170 mph. Blazing a track a mile wide, it killed at least 23 people, including three children.Another EF4 tornado was part of an outbreak that tore through eight states just two weeks before Christmas 2021. It destroyed part of Mayfield, Kentucky, and left at least 74 people dead in that state alone.These monsters cause complete devastation, flattening nearly everything in their path.They are rare, with only 59 have been recorded in the United States since 1950, according to the Storm Prediction Center.The most recent struck in 2013 in Moore, Oklahoma, killing 24 people, including several students at an elementary school where only a few walls were left standing.",world,0.0

They unfolded orange banners bearing the words in Italian: “Our future is as black as this water” as crowds of onlookers snapped pictures.It is believed to be the same group of climate activists that led protests at other Italian historical sites including the Barcaccia fountain at the base of the Spanish Steps in central Rome, where they poured black liquid into the fountain on April 1.Similar protests saw activists glue themselves to Italian art masterpieces in locations like the Vatican museums and Uffizi galleries in Florence.“It is absurd that this gesture should shock you when we are experiencing a drought emergency that is putting agriculture, energy production in crisis,” the group said of its protest then.Members of the group were arrested by police and are facing charges of defacing a public monument.Located in the famed Piazza Navona square in Rome, the Fiumi Fountain was designed by Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1651.Italy’s Minister of Culture Gennaro Sangiuliano condemned the activists’ protest and said those responsible must “pay out of their own pockets.”“We have to record yet another defacement that endangers the beauty of one of our nation’s iconic works of art,” Sangiuliano said.“As I have explained many times, these are acts against the environment which they claim to want to defend because the notion of landscape includes what beautiful things over centuries of history human genius has produced,” he added.“Experts talk about anthropization of the environment. Now again, a lot of water will have to be used to clean up and costs incurred to restore the state of the monument – and (paying for it) will be Italian citizens.”Describing the group as “eco-vandals,” Sangiuliano said: “I hope Parliament will approve new regulations against them as soon as possible.”",world,0.0

But it also drew demonstrators, with protesters wearing yellow T-shirts booing and shouting “Not My King” throughout the morning.Republic, Britain’s largest anti-monarchy group, told CNN that police – without providing any reason – arrested organizers of the anti-monarchy protest.At around 7 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) police stopped six of Republic’s organizers and told them they were detaining and searching them, Republic director Harry Stratton told CNN at the protest.Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, was among those detained, according to a video shared by the Alliance of European Republican Movements.Stratton said that when the organizers asked police why they were being detained, they were told officers “would figure it out” after they had searched the anti-monarchy protesters. After searching them, police told the six organizers they were arresting them and seizing hundreds of their placards carrying the slogan “Not My King.”“They didn’t say why they were arresting them. They didn’t tell them or us where they were taking them. It really is like something out of a police state,” Stratton said.“I think people are quite perturbed by the police reaction. But the crowd reaction to us has been overwhelmingly friendly,” he added.The group posted on Twitter Saturday, commenting: “So much for the right to peaceful protest.”Members of environmental activist group Just Stop Oil also appeared to have been arrested on The Mall outside Buckingham Palace, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported, adding that a large group of the protesters were seen in handcuffs.The Metropolitan Police confirmed several arrests had been made in central London and defended its actions.“A total of 52 arrests have been made today for offenses including affray, public order offenses, breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. All of these people remain in custody,” the police said in a press release.Commander Karen Findlay, who is leading the police operation, said in the release: “We absolutely understand public concern following the arrests we made this morning.“Protest is lawful and it can be disruptive. We have policed numerous protests without intervention in the build-up to the coronation, and during it.“Our duty is to do so in a proportionate manner in line with relevant legislation. We also have a duty to intervene when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption.“This depends on the context. The coronation is a once in a generation event and that is a key consideration in our assessment. A protest involving large numbers has gone ahead today with police knowledge and no intervention.”Human Rights Watch, a non-profit campaign group, said earlier Saturday that the coronation arrests were “something you would expect to see in Moscow not London,” according to a statement obtained by PA Media.Republic claimed it was expecting between 1,500 and 2,000 people to join the group at its protest in Trafalgar Square, just south of the royal procession route.“Instead of a coronation we want an election. Instead of Charles we want a choice. It’s that simple,” the group tweeted on Saturday.The Metropolitan Police, the UK’s largest police force, has been scrutinized for its tough approach toward protests around the coronation.“Our tolerance for any disruption, whether through protest or otherwise, will be low,” the force wrote on Twitter this week. “We will deal robustly with anyone intent on undermining this celebration.”Ahead of the event, the Met said that more than 11,500 police officers would be deployed in London on Saturday, making the coronation the largest one-day deployment in decades.The operation – labeled Golden Orb – saw officers line the processional route, manage crowds and road closures, protect high-profile individuals and carry out searches with specialist teams.There are also plans for facial recognition technology to be used in central London, which has sparked criticism from human rights groups.“We all have the right to go about our lives without being watched and monitored, but everyone at the coronation is at risk of having their faces scanned by oppressive facial recognition technology,” Emmanuelle Andrews of human rights group Liberty, said on Twitter.The operation comes amid growing concern over the increase in the police’s power to stifle dissent in Britain, following the recent introduction of controversial pieces of legislation.Last year, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 significantly “broaden[ed] the range of circumstances in which police may impose conditions on a protest.” Under the new Act, it is an offense for protesters to “intentionally or recklessly caus[e] public nuisance” – including causing “serious annoyance.”In a statement to CNN, Liberty said this Act “has made it much harder for people to stand up for what they believe without facing the risk of criminalization.”On Tuesday, a new law called the Public Order Act received royal assent from King Charles, which is a formality and the final hurdle before a bill becomes law.It will “give police the powers to prevent disruption at major sporting and cultural events taking place this summer in England and Wales,” the UK Home Office said in a statement.Specific measures in the Act were introduced from Wednesday.Under this law, long-standing protest tactics such as locking on – where protesters physically attach themselves to things like buildings – could lead to a six-month prison sentence or “unlimited fine,” said the Home Office.",world,0.0

Wright designed the home in 1929 for his cousin, Richard Lloyd Jones, who was publisher of the Tulsa Tribune at the time. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.The sprawling concrete-and-glass property is coming to market after a two-year-long restoration project, according to the Wall Street Journal, which involved repairing its facade, updating the kitchen, getting rid of carpeted floors and restoring the pool and grounds. The home’s exterior is composed of stacks of patterned concrete blocks — now known as Wright’s “textile block” construction system — as well as 5,200 glass panes, providing sun-drenched rooms and views of the surrounding landscape.Inside, the airy open plan includes five bedrooms and four baths, with some original wood furniture included in the sale.Wright’s most famous residences include the iconic Fallingwater in the Pennsylvania mountains, his former desert vacation home and studio Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the quintessential prairie-style Robie House in Chicago. All of these properties have since been opened to the public.Around 400 of Wright’s homes remain today and, with most still in private hands, they often resurface on the market. In February, the architect’s sole oceanfront California home sold off-market for $22 million, according to SFGate, but others have come up at more attainable price points. Last September, a six-bedroom home in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, that Wright designed in 1956 went on the market for the first time, selling for just over $1 million; in January, a three-bedroom Wright residence in Oak Park, Illinois, sold for $485,000. (Listing photos for the property, which the previous owners had lived in for some 60 years, revealed it was in need of significant restoration.)Westhope is being sold by Sotheby’s International Realty. The listing touts that Wright only made a handful of concrete block homes in this manner, making the property a “remarkable rare jewel.”",style,0.0

We appreciate your uplifting prayers as we deal with the overwhelming loss of our father. We ask for respect and privacy during this challenging time.”Blue was drafted by the then-Kansas City Athletics in the second round of the 1967 draft. He made his Major League Baseball debut two years later in 1969 at the age of 19, in the team’s second year after moving to Oakland.In his career, Blue pitched 17 seasons with the Athletics, San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals. He finished with a 209-161 record, with a 3.27 ERA and 2,175 strikeouts.“There are few players with a more decorated career than Vida Blue. He was a three-time champion, an MVP, a six-time All-Star, a Cy Young Award winner, and an Oakland A’s Hall of Famer,” the Athletics said in a statement.“Vida will always be a franchise legend and a friend. We send our deepest condolences to his family and friends during this arduous time.”In 1971, the hard-throwing left-hander became the youngest Most Valuable Player in AL/NL history after going 24-8 with a 1.82 ERA, while tallying 301 strikeouts and 24 complete games. Blue also won the American League Cy Young Award winner that season, becoming only the fifth player ever to win both awards in the same year.In his nine seasons with the Athletics, Blue helped the team win three-straight World Series titles from 1972-74, a feat that only the New York Yankees (1998-2000) have accomplished since.Blue’s MLB career derailed because of drug issues. Blue was suspended from baseball and served a brief prison sentence for attempting to purchase cocaine, according to MLB.com. He was suspended the entire 1984 season by MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn, before being reinstated in 1985.He would pitch two more seasons with the Giants before retiring in 1987.Blue was inducted into the A’s Hall of Fame in 2019 and is a member of the Giants Wall of Fame and Bay Area Hall of Fame.“Vida Blue has been a Bay Area baseball icon for over 50 years,” said Giants president and CEO Larry Baer in a statement. “His impact on the Bay Area transcends his 17 years on the diamond with the influence he’s had on our community. For many years, he was such an integral part of our Junior Giants program. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family and friends during his time.”",sport,0.0

I think this is a big step for us, a young team coming here and doing all the things we did. It shows we’ve come a long way.”Sunday’s game got off to a frantic start as Jacob Murphy hit the post for Newcastle in the second minute before the home side also had a penalty – initially awarded for handball against Jakub Kiwior – ruled out following a video assistant referee review.Despite Newcastle’s bright start, Arsenal took the lead through Ødegaard’s brilliant shot from outside the box – the Norwegian’s 15th league goal of the season.Both teams had chances later in the first half – Arsenal when Gabriel Martinelli and then Bukayo Saka were denied by Nick Pope and Newcastle when Joe Willock forced a good save from Aaron Ramsdale.The two goalkeepers produced excellent saves throughout the match, notably when Pope used his feet to stop Ødegaard getting a second right at the end of the first half and also when Schär’s close-range header was palmed away by Ramsdale.Martinelli nearly extended Arsenal’s lead when he hit the bar before playing a crucial role as his side did go 2-0 ahead, driving into the Newcastle box before seeing his cross deflected in by Schär’s attempted interception.With that own goal, Arsenal could see out the remainder of the game in a more comfortable fashion.Mikel Arteta’s side has another tough test against Brighton on Sunday before finishing the season with games against Nottingham Forest and Wolves – all of which Arsenal realistically has to win in order to boost its slim chances of overtaking City at the top of the table.“The desire to keep digging, keep believing – that reward is so big,” Arteta told Sky Sports. “Today, we had to do it here and we did everything we had to do to win the game.”",sport,0.0

She was allegedly driven to the airport and then was asked to speak to Woods’ attorney.“Then, Mr. Woods’s California lawyer, out of the blue, told her that she was not going anywhere, would never see Mr. Woods again, had been locked out of the house, and could not return,” the document said. “She would not even be able to see the children or her pets again.”Herman was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which she refused to do, according to the document.Herman has brought two separate complaints involving Woods in the past year.The first, filed in October 2022, alleges a trust owned and created by the golf star violated the Florida Residential Landlord Tenant Act by breaking her oral tenancy agreement to continue living in Woods’ home.As part of that suit, a trustee of Woods’ trust, Christopher Hubman, has asked the court to order Herman to arbitrate her claims pursuant to an arbitration provision in a non-disclosure agreement she signed in 2017.In an earlier briefing, Herman cited a statute that says plaintiffs in sexual harassment or assault disputes cannot be compelled to arbitrate those claims.The most recent suit, filed in March, Herman argues the 2017 agreement is not enforceable in part because of a new federal law invalidating arbitration clauses in sexual assault or sexual harassment cases.",politics,0.0
58,63,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/football/liverpool-king-charles-coronation-national-anthem-ckc-spt-intl/index.html,Why Liverpool fans booed while national anthem played at Anfield for King Charles’ coronation,2023-05-07 11:00:00,"Liverpool fans booed resoundingly while “God Save the King” played at Anfield to mark King Charles III’s coronation on Saturday.TV footage showed Liverpool and Brentford players lining up on opposite sides of the center circle before kickoff while the national anthem played. Loud boos and jeering from the crowd could be heard, as well as chants of “Liverpool.”Afterwards, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told reporters that he respected it was “a big day for England” but added: “It was clear that something like (the booing) would happen.“That’s allowed, nothing else happened,” he said. “It wasn’t any kind of chants or anything. People just showed … they were not always happy in the past with how the people of Liverpool, the city or the club, were dealt with.”Liverpool fans have a history of booing the national anthem, most recently doing so before last season’s FA Cup final at Wembley. Many also booed Prince William when he appeared on the pitch that day.The club confirmed it would play “God Save the King” ahead of its match against Brentford on Saturday to respect the coronation of King Charles III, despite admitting that many supporters hold “strong views” on the issue.The decision came after the Premier League requested that the national anthem be played ahead of every match this weekend to celebrate the coronation services of the King and the Queen Consort, which took place on Saturday.“Before kick-off and in recognition of the Premier League’s request to mark the coronation, players and officials will congregate around the centre circle when the national anthem will be played,” Liverpool said in a statement Friday.“It is, of course, a personal choice how those at Anfield on Saturday mark this occasion and we know some supporters have strong views on it.”So why exactly do Liverpool fans have a history of booing the British national anthem? The answer has everything to do with the history of the city itself.Liverpool suffered during the deindustrialization of the UK economy in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, resulted in nine days of riots in the city.In the aftermath of the unrest, Margaret Thatcher’s government talked of a “managed decline” of the city.During this decade of Conservative rule, Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of the country, and the state’s handling of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 further entrenched those anti-establishment feelings.Booing of the national anthem at football matches when the team played at Wembley – which was frequent given Liverpool’s dominance of English football in this era – became widespread and remains so today.Many fans had the same reaction at the Carabao Cup final in February 2022 and at the FA Cup final in 2012.Booing the anthem is a way for some of the club’s supporters to voice their opposition towards the establishment, and it’s a chance to do so before a worldwide audience.The King’s coronation on Saturday also comes at a time when many are feeling the devastating effects of the severe cost of living crisis that is now impacting the whole of the UK.High inflation, years of wage stagnation and the sudden and steep rise in energy prices have left millions of Brits on the brink of poverty.At the same time, the UK government is spending tens of millions of taxpayers’ money on a glitzy celebration.Social and economic inequality is something that continues to anger many in the left-leaning city of Liverpool.Significantly, it was Liverpool and Everton supporters who started Fans’ Supporting Foodbanks in 2015, an initiative which aims to tackle food poverty in the UK.When previously asked about the club’s decision to play the national anthem, Klopp said “the club’s position is my position.”“This is definitely a subject I cannot have a proper opinion about it. I am from Germany, we don’t have a king, or a queen, or these kind of things,” he told reporters on Friday.“I am pretty sure a lot of people in this country will enjoy the coronation, some will maybe not really be interested, and some will not like it. That’s it. That’s all over the country.”Many feared Liverpool fans might disrupt a minute’s silence for Queen Elizabeth II after her death last year but, on that occasion, only a few isolated boos were heard.",sport,0.0

For many, this constant bad news adds to the stress of everyday life, which may already feel overwhelming.According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, each year in the US, one in five adults experience mental illness and one in six children aged 6 to 17 experience a mental health disorder. That’s millions of people. In 2021, less than half of adults received treatment.America’s mental health crisis is having a widespread impact that touches everyone.“One of the things that we underestimate as a society is how our global mental health impacts us as individuals. And we have seen it over and over again as we experience gun violence,” said Michele Neff Hernandez, a 2021 CNN Hero who has helped millions navigate grief and loss through her nonprofit Soaring Spirits. “We can see what happens when people don’t get the help they need; there can be tragic consequences.”Neff Hernandez is one of many CNN Heroes who have found unique ways to help people with their mental health. Some of them marked Mental Health Awareness Month by sharing advice and insight with CNN’s Elizabeth Belanger about what is working for their communities. Below are edited versions of their conversations.For Neff Hernandez, whose organization helps widowed people connect with each other in a community of support, it’s important for everyone to know they aren’t alone in their struggle. Mental illness is common, yet the stigma surrounding it is often a hurdle for people seeking the treatment they need.Michele Neff Hernandez: When our body isn’t working well, going to a doctor to seek the cause or to help alleviate symptoms is considered normal and even responsible. Yet, when we are struggling with our mental health for any reason – including grieving a death, experiencing a traumatic event, even coping with the global and national crises that are a part of our daily narrative – we so often hesitate to seek mental health support. The pervasive stigmatizing narrative that implies that seeking mental health support shows weakness or that a mental illness or the breakdown of our mental health for any reason is something to be ashamed of has a significantly negative impact on our society, especially our young people.We have to model good mental health care by learning about mental health with the same vigor we use to learn about physical health. Imagine if meditation were as popular as weight loss. Or if picking up your mood stabilizing medication was viewed in the same way as picking up your blood pressure medication. Normalizing caring for and seeking help with mental health is a gift we can give ourselves and the next generation. We all need mental health support at many times in our lives; what a gift it would be if accessing that help were viewed as just part of normal life.We see this in grief all the time: No one wants to allow people to be sad. We seek to fix instead of listen. We pressure grieving people to “get over it” to make others more comfortable. We set the definition of success after a traumatic event as “returning to normal,” even when returning to a past normal is impossible. The truth is we are always changed by the challenges we overcome, and integrating what we’ve learned about ourselves in the aftermath is one of the key elements of building resilience. When we stigmatize mental health care, we create an environment that ensures that the people who most need help will suffer alone.Annette March-Grier is a 2014 CNN Hero and the founder of Roberta’s House, a bereavement center in Baltimore, Maryland. Their programs reach more than 4,000 people of all ages each year. In 2021, the organization moved into a new state-of-the-art center where it hosts in-person support groups and serves people who are suffering all types of loss.March-Grier stresses the importance of putting yourself first to enhance mental well-being.Annette March-Grier: Everyone is looking for some kind of balance, yet few are finding it. Your state of mind is where it all begins. Make self-care a priority for your mental wellness. “Self-care is not selfish.” It is a truth that if you don’t take care of yourself, you will have nothing to give others. This includes healthy relationships that can be jeopardized because of stress, burnout, and lack of self-care. Your physical health is also connected to your mental health. Negative thoughts and suppression of these can cause dis-ease, and over time this leads to disease.Self-care means taking time out for self, creating a gratitude list, journaling, dancing, laughing, breathing fully, smelling the fresh air, being aware of surroundings, being in the moment, enjoying the stillness when you can, taking time out for self, playing with your pet, exercising, reflecting on the past, dreaming about the future, eating healthy, helping someone in need. All of these self-care activities increase the body’s endorphins and bring on relaxation and balance.Sports helped 2012 CNN Hero Scott Strode overcome his addiction to drugs and alcohol. He founded The Phoenix in 2007 to provide free athletic activities and a sober support community to others battling addiction. Today, the organization is in more than 200 communities nationwide with nearly 200,000 members.Strode’s work focuses on the intersection of exercise and personal connection to benefit mental health.Scott Strode: Social connection is a powerful tool for creating positive mental health. At The Phoenix, every day we see the profound impact that belonging and social connection has on our members’ confidence and overall well-being. Just spending a few minutes daily in the presence of others can be inherently powerful, and thankfully it is now easier than ever to make these vital connections.Whether it’s getting together for an activity or just talking about challenges being faced, social connectivity can help us all overcome mental health challenges.Exercise can also be a powerful tool to improve mental health. We encourage you to get out for a 15- to 30-minute walk or run and consider inviting a friend to join you. Sharing these physical activities with supportive peers can create the vulnerability to begin to share about what else you might be experiencing.Service dogs are often a helpful tool for members of the military returning from deployment and afflicted by conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety. 2012 CNN Hero Mary Cortani’s nonprofit, Operation Freedom Paws, has helped nearly 600 veterans, first responders, and others train their own service dogs.Cortani emphasizes that not all wounds are visible, and silence is not a treatment for mental illness.Mary Cortani: If the world has taught me anything, it has taught me to remember to be kind, do not judge what you cannot see. Pain is invisible. With all the craziness going on every day, breathe. It is okay to feel down, to feel overloaded, overwhelmed, sad, frustrated. Try not to hold onto it. Seek help, talk to your family, friends, pastor, priest – talk to someone. And for those listening, really hear, pay attention, because sometimes the silence says more than the words. There is no shame to ask for help. It takes courage, and we all have it within us.It takes all of us to realize mental health needs to be talked about, not buried under the rug. We need open, honest conversations; we have a mental health crisis in this country that is only getting worse as we become more divided. Fear only adds to it. Mental health doesn’t just affect veterans and first responders; it can affect everyone. Trauma is trauma, and enough repeated exposure changes the brain. There is hope, and there can be healing, but we all need to work together to help those who need our help.We need to stop the silence surrounding mental health and model healthy behaviors so that we can assist with support and help guide towards resources. We are not in this alone, nor are those suffering from mental health issues.",world,0.0

Many of them were pet owners who had to leave their dogs and cats behind, hoping it would only be a matter of days before they were able to return to them.It wasn’t long before Ukrainian veterinarians Valentina and Leonid Stoyanov learned that many pets were locked in nearby homes.“After one, two weeks … neighbors just start hear (sic) how a lot of different animals around them screaming,” Valentina told CNN.At the time, the couple specialized in exotic animal and wildlife rescue. With the invasion came a new mission: caring for these beloved but abandoned pets.The Stoyanovs began working with local police to access homes to rescue dogs and cats. Within a week of the invasion, Leonid said they were caring for some 400 animals in their Odesa clinic.“Each animal for us, it’s like members of our family,” Valentina said.For the last decade, the couple has worked together treating more unusual animals and wildlife. Before the war, their videos of the monkeys, snakes, owls, and other creatures they rescued and cared for found a growing audience on their “Vet Crew” TikTok and Instagram feeds.Valentina said their “simple life” has changed drastically.“All our family – mother, father – have to leave Ukraine,” Leonid said. “But we decided we stay here and help animals – a lot of animals.”Their clinic is partially underground and surrounded by taller buildings offering some protection from Russian attacks. But the lack of electricity is one of their most serious challenges. The couple needed to find a generator to keep the lights on and their reptiles warm.The Stoyanovs purchased tons of dog and cat food that they distribute to area shelters. They have also often driven to the front lines to help animals in need. Leonid recalls wearing body armor on his many trips vaccinating and feeding dogs there.“Russian army a lot of times shooting our car and they bombed it. And one time they missed (by) maybe ten meters. And we have a lot of holes in our car,” he said.During the last year, Leonid’s health also took a turn for the worse. He suffered a heart attack and said he was clinically dead for several minutes before doctors were able to revive him.“They say, “You have a lot of animals. You need to (be) here,” he said.He has since had two surgeries, including one to implant a pacemaker. And despite some discomfort, he says he feels “physically normal” now.The Stoyanovs usually try to find new homes for the animals they rescue, or they release wild animals back into their natural habitat. But it was a different story for a blind husky named Casper, now a permanent member of the Stoyanov family. He belonged to a Ukrainian soldier named Sergei who had no family and asked the couple to care for his dog while he was away fighting.“It was very touching moment when Casper and … Sergei say goodbye (to) each other. Because Sergei crying and Casper also crying,” Valentina said.Sergei would call every week, but after about two months, Casper began acting strangely and cried. The Stoyanovs later learned that this was around the time when Sergei was killed, Leonid said.“It’s very, very depressive situation (here),” Leonid said. “We cannot sleep because we are nervous. … We have a lot of work, a lot of animals, a lot of people dying, a lot of our friends dying.”Despite all of the challenges, the couple say they have no plans to stop.“We just hold on and continue to do what we do because we see how it is important for animals, for all these lives around us,” Valentina said.The Stoyanovs are grateful for the support they receive online from their social media community, whom they call their Vet Crew Family. They said it’s their encouragement that keeps them going.“Without these people, what we do here right now in Ukraine will not be possible. And this is why all these people (become) family for us,” Valentina said. “And I think most important message for all of them, it is … thank you.”",world,0.0
61,66,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/21/us/florida-coral-reef-ecosystem-restoration-diving-cnnheroes/index.html,This CNN Hero is recruiting recreational divers to help rebuild reefs in Florida one coral at a time,"09:34 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Mike Goldberg spent his early career working in financial services, putting in long hours for 12 years, he said, before he decided it was time to call it quits.“I was just chasing money,” he said. “But I realized that is not me. … It just wasn’t true to my core.”In 1996, Goldberg left his job and his home in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving, spending time in Hawaii, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands.“When I got out of the water after my very first dive, I decided that this is what I really wanted to do … to take my life and somehow intertwine diving and making a living,” he said.In 2004, Goldberg and his family settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives.Today, he’s on a mission to help bring the area’s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit, I.CARE.As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. They not only support all kinds of species, but they protect coastal areas, and millions of people depend on them for food and jobs.Over the last two decades, he saw coral reefs in the Florida Keys go from colorful and full of life to functionally extinct today. What he used to see were “brain coral the size of a VW Beetle, and fields of staghorn and elkhorn coral that went on forever,” he said.Now, he says many of the reefs in the area cannot recover naturally on their own and require human intervention to survive. Goldberg knew he needed to do something to help and wanted to find a way to get other people involved.“I know more about the history of and what’s happening now to the reef than most people,” he said. “I’m not a scientist, but that puts me in a unique position to communicate in layman’s terms about what’s going on.”He realized that recreational divers could be a great workforce to help turn around the damage and restore the reefs. He also envisioned that other local dive shops, residents, and tourists could play a role.Around the same time, he met Dr. Kylie Smith, who was completing her PhD to become a behavioral ecologist and a coral reef ecologist. They spent hours at Goldberg’s dive shop discussing the health of the reef.In 2019, they teamed up to co-found I.CARE, which stands for Islamorada Conservation and Restoration Education, with the goal of empowering divers to help restore the area’s reefs, ensuring their survival for future generations.I.CARE organizes and offers special coral restoration dives for local and out-of-town participants. They spend the day learning about the importance of coral reefs and how to help rebuild them, then they go on dives to transplant coral grown in a local nursery run by Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium.So far, Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it’s thriving.“There’s so much work to do. We’re just getting started,” Goldberg said.CNN’s Laura Klairmont spoke with Goldberg about his efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What has caused the degradation of the coral reefs in the Florida Keys?Mike Goldberg: The Keys in general – the ocean, the coral reef, the marine life – used to be the best anywhere. When I moved here 20 years ago, (there were) massive elkhorn corals that I used to swim around that were 12 feet across in both directions. Fields of them and stalks like trees that you could swim underneath on your back and marvel looking up at. Back then, we could swim a quarter mile in one direction and see nothing more than a quarter inch between the live coral. The live coral would compete for that underwater territory. Today, I could swim 20 feet in one direction and not see any. We’ve lost so much coral. It’s hard to express it. It truly is a pretty devastating number.The coral reefs are threatened by ocean acidification, temperature, runoff. And then in 2014, there was something we called stony coral tissue loss disease. (It) was the sledgehammer that changed everything. It is incredibly virulent, and it started up near Miami and worked its way down. In 2016, it presented itself here, and we lost more coral in that one year than we did in all my prior years combined in diving. It was so dramatic watching this coral head die all in front of us. And we didn’t know what to do, how to stop it. It was very hard to watch, and feel helpless, wishing you could do something to stop it.CNN: Why are coral reefs so important to the health of the ocean?Goldberg: Without them, nothing is here simply put. They are what brings the ecosystem together. The majority of what we see out there at one point in their life is spending time on a coral reef. There’s small fish, not bigger than a grain of rice, all the way up to your large predatory fish, tiger sharks. The entire ecosystem’s right there out on the reef at any given point. Whether it’s a neon goby, whether it’s a cleaner shrimp, whether it’s a juvenile Spanish hogfish. Without that live coral as their home, that disappears. And when they’re gone, we have fewer snappers, grouper. It’s just a cascade effect because that goes all the way up the food chain. So, it’s imperative that we have a healthy coral reef for us to have a full ecosystem. Without a coral reef, there’s so many problems that will ensue.CNN: What is unique about your approach to the work?Goldberg: I knew the only way that I could make it work is through the power of the recreational dive community. What I believed would work, and is, (is they’re) coming down and helping us rebuild the reef. There are a lot of them. And I truly believe at their core the vast majority want to be a part of this. And my experience so far has been just that. They want to keep doing it. They love being part of it.What I can do is tell the world of divers that are out there, “Let’s band together. This is a plight not only for the Keys, but the Caribbean, for the Pacific, for the Red Sea. It’s all around the world. And if we, as a community of divers, don’t attempt to bring back or at least get it to a self-sustaining level, the dive community will disappear.”This avenue gives those individuals another reason to come diving. They can be talking to their friends, to their families, getting them excited and spreading out those tendrils so we get more and more people down here helping us rebuild the reef.I truly believe we’re going to be successful with this restoration work. I see things every time I go in the water that give me hope that we will have a sustaining coral reef.Want to get involved?

62,67,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/14/us/california-street-veterinary-medicine-pets-cnnheroes/index.html,This CNN Hero offers judgment-free veterinary care for the pets of those experiencing homelessness,"09:34 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Dr. Kwane Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago as a personal mission that he kept to himself.“It was my way to heal,” said Stewart, a veterinarian whose nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness. “Maybe some of it was guilt. Maybe some of it was I just wanted my own little crusade.”Stewart had spent several years working in a county shelter in Northern California when he thought about quitting in 2011. He’d long dreamed of saving animals but was instead forced to euthanize an increasing number of those that were being surrendered.“It was the recession. I’m seeing hordes of unwanted pets dropped off, people who don’t have the money to feed them or care for them medically,” Stewart, 53, said. “It started to steal a part of my soul. I thought about leaving the veterinary profession altogether.”Stewart was at a crossroads, he said, desperately trying to lower the shelter’s rates of euthanasia and increase adoption rates, but also struggling with the sheer number of animals dropped off there. On a whim one morning, he stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee.“I’d seen this guy before and ignored him. Regrettably, just walked by him,” Stewart said. “And on this day, I just broke pattern because I noticed his dog had some sort of serious skin condition.”Stewart diagnosed and treated the dog’s condition, and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was the real wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter.“That was the moment I said to myself, ‘I’m going to do more of this. I’m going to get back to saving animals on my terms. And I’m going to do it for passion, not for pay.’”Soon after, Stewart began to do more outreach, setting up small drop-in clinics to provide medical care to pets whose owners couldn’t afford it and walking the streets looking for unhoused individuals whose pets needed help. Right away he was struck by how much the pet owners cared for their beloved animals.“They’re with each other 24/7 hours a day. Their bond and relationship is on a different level,” Stewart said. “Because they’re not in a traditional home, it doesn’t necessarily make them less of a pet parent. A pet doesn’t care about nice furniture and a big home, they want to spend it with you.”And he found that many pet owners wanted to share their stories about their dog and their history together.With their consent, Stewart’s brother, Ian, eventually began documenting some of the work and personal stories to raise awareness about animal welfare and homelessness.“They probably get criticized more than anything, especially from people in the outside world. But I’ve seen people give up their last meal for their pet and people who have $3 to their name, and after I’m done with the treatment, they will try and give me that $3,” Stewart said.His brother encouraged him to spread the word and join forces with others to provide street care, and soon more like-minded animal welfare professionals jumped on board.Genesis Rendon, a registered veterinary nurse who Stewart calls his “right-hand,” had worked in the veterinary field for nearly two decades and was doing her own street outreach when she teamed up with him in 2016. Today, as a lead volunteer for Project Street Vet, she is often by Stewart’s side in homeless camps and on Los Angeles’ Skid Row assisting animals in need.“Now it’s spreading across the country,” Stewart said. “I’m building a network of trusted volunteers, technicians with hospitals and clinics we can call on. These are all people who just reached out and said, ‘I’m inspired by what you do. How do I do it?’”Stewart says they can treat about 80% of the cases they see out of a small portable kit. Treatments include antibiotics, vaccines, and anti-inflammatories as well as deworming and flea and tick medications.“It’s boots on the ground,” Stewart said, adding that their group will also help connect animals in need to clinic services. “And whenever we can, we advocate for or assist people in getting their animals spayed and neutered.”Stewart’s work with Project Street Vet is all volunteer, and the organization has expanded to other cities, including Orlando and Atlanta.“It doesn’t matter what your situation is or what your background or past is, I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help. … It’s at no cost to them. It’s free.”Since he started, Stewart and his volunteer teams have treated thousands of animals while giving their human parents hope and dignity, too.“I will say this about the people I’ve met who have pets on the streets,” he said. “They are some of the most remarkable pet parents I’ve ever met.”Want to get involved?

63,68,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/hunter-biden-irs-whistleblower-congressional-investigation/index.html,IRS whistleblower’s attorneys meet with congressional investigators on Hunter Biden probe,2023-05-07 18:45:00,"Attorneys for an IRS whistleblower who allege there is political interference at the Justice Department in the Hunter Biden criminal investigation met with congressional investigators Friday to lay the groundwork for what their client hopes to share with Congress, according to sources familiar with the matter.The attorneys privately offered investigators from the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee and Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee a glimpse into the information their client could share with Congress, the sources said. Such a disclosure is a typical early step in whistleblower cases involving sensitive tax information.A Republican aide with the Ways and Means Committee said they anticipate an in-person interview with the whistleblower in the near future.The whistleblower alleges that Delaware US Attorney David Weiss’ ability to bring charges in the case is being thwarted by political appointees. That would contradict promises by Attorney General Merrick Garland in congressional testimony that Weiss, a Donald Trump appointee, has full authority to make final decisions on whether to prosecute President Joe Biden’s son.“The process is proceeding on a bipartisan basis with ranking member [Mike] Crapo’s staff,” said Ryan Carey, a spokesman for Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.Last month, Mark Lytle, an attorney for the whistleblower, wrote to a handful of House and Senate committee leaders expressing his client’s interest in making “protected whistleblower disclosures to Congress.”Lytle said his client, an unnamed IRS criminal supervisory special agent, “has been overseeing the ongoing and sensitive investigation of a high-profile, controversial subject,” which a source has confirmed was Hunter Biden.Federal prosecutors have spent years, spanning three attorneys general, investigating Hunter Biden and have weighed bringing charges against him for alleged tax crimes and a false statement, CNN has previously reported. So far, no charges have been filed. Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing.The president affirmed his support for his son in an interview that aired Friday on MSNBC, adding that the Justice Department’s investigation would not affect his presidency.“First of all, my son has done nothing wrong. I trust him. I have faith in him,” Joe Biden told Stephanie Ruhle. “It impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him.”In an April statement, the White House said the president was committed to an investigation “free from any political interference.”“President Biden has made clear that this matter would be handled independently by the Justice Department, under the leadership of a U.S. Attorney appointed by President Trump, free from any political interference by the White House. He has upheld that commitment,” White House spokesman Ian Sams said.The IRS whistleblower claimed to have information that “contradicts sworn testimony to Congress by a senior political appointee,” according to the letter from his attorney. That senior political appointee was Garland, people familiar with the matter previously told CNN.Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, Garland said: “I have pledged not to interfere with that investigation, and I have carried through on my pledge.”At the March hearing, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley asked Garland whether Weiss has had to seek the cooperation of US attorneys in the District of Columbia or California to bring the Hunter Biden case. The question was based on information Grassley’s investigators have received on possible obstacles Weiss may face to bring the tax charges, a person briefed on the matter said. That’s because Hunter Biden lives in southern California and the tax documents at issue were prepared in Washington, DC, making those the two jurisdictions where a prosecution could be brought.Garland responded to the question by saying he hasn’t heard of Weiss having any obstacles in bringing a case.“The US attorney in Delaware has been advised that he has full authority to make those kinds of referrals that you’re talking about or to bring cases in other jurisdictions if he feels that it’s necessary, and I will assure that if he does that he will be able to do that,” Garland said. “If he needs to bring a case in another jurisdiction, he will have my full authority to do that.”Justice Department regulations provide for Weiss to get permission from the attorney general to seek to bring a case in a jurisdiction outside of Delaware. A person briefed on the matter said Garland has ensured Weiss has the authority to do so.Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the US attorneys in Delaware, California’s Central District, and Washington, DC, declined to comment.This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0

65,70,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/politics/afghan-evacuees-stuck-uae-private-evacuation/index.html,"Thousands of Afghans escaped the Taliban with the help of private veteran groups. Today, many remain in limbo, held in a compound in the UAE",2023-05-07 15:08:00,"About 2,100 Afghan refugees remain held in a sprawling compound in the United Arab Emirates more than 18 months after they were evacuated from Afghanistan largely by private groups working with the State Department.They are what’s left of as many as 20,000 Afghans who were hastily relocated to the camp during the chaotic weeks surrounding the US withdrawal after Kabul fell to the Taliban in August 2021. Several thousand were brought there by the State Department directly from Kabul and have since been relocated to the US or Canada.But thousands more, including those still stuck in the UAE, were evacuated weeks later, and sometimes from hundreds of miles away from Kabul, by private groups working to get as many out of Afghanistan as possible.Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the private evacuation efforts, though well-intentioned, contributed at times to an already chaotic situation – though they also say that the frenzy of the withdrawal created unclear communication and expectations.Consequently, thousands of Afghans evacuated by private groups were left in a legal limbo with seemingly no clear path to the US – or anywhere else. And though the effort to resettle them has picked up in recent months, refugees inside the compound known as Emirates Humanitarian City, or EHC, are restless after almost two years of waiting inside a camp they are barred from leaving.Without a visa, they’re not allowed inside the country.When they first arrived in the UAE in August 2021, Afghan evacuees were housed across dozens of buildings in the gated compound. Afghans were separated in rooms with their families across multi-level buildings divided by a common outdoor space.They were supposed to be there for a few days. But that’s now approaching two years for the more than 2,000 people who remain there. The State Department says it continues to process refugees out of EHC “on an ongoing basis.” One American Marine veteran closely involved said  that a family or two leave each week, bound mostly for the US and Canada, as well as Australia, with some scattered across Europe.At that pace it could still take more than a year to empty out the entire population of evacuees who remain at the compound.Their plight has gained recent attention from human rights groups, who say the refugees are being held arbitrarily by the UAE and have been subject to a host of abuses, including poor medical care and being held in “prison-like” conditions.A report put out by Human Rights Watch in March said Afghan asylum seekers have been “locked up for over 15 months in cramped, miserable conditions with no hope of progress on their cases” and are “facing further trauma now, after spending well over a year in limbo.”In a statement to CNN, a UAE official said the refugees at EHC have “received a comprehensive range of high-quality housing, sanitation, health, clinical, counseling, education, and food services to ensure their welfare.”The official said the UAE “continues to do everything it can to bring this extraordinary exercise in humanitarian resettlement to a satisfactory conclusion. We understand that there are frustrations and this has taken longer than intended to complete.”“The UAE remains committed to this ongoing cooperation with the US and other international partners to ensure that Afghan evacuees can live in safety, security, and dignity,” the official added.Allegations similar to those raised by the HRW report were described in an appeal to the United Nations submitted last fall by an independent American attorney, who alleged “widespread human rights abuses,” including inadequate health and mental health care, “constant” surveillance and “restricted access” to government officials working their cases.In a statement to CNN, Mara Tekach, State Department coordinator for Afghan relocation efforts, said that while the department is aware of the Human Rights Watch report, the US government “is not aware of any verified allegations of human rights violations at EHC.”CNN has not independently verified those allegations.One refugee still stuck at EHC who spoke to CNN described extreme frustration over a seemingly hopeless situation. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns, said he worries about the effect the ordeal is having on his young daughter.“My daughter, from months ago until now, sometime when she starts talking, I can feel the pain in her voice,” he said.The man showed CNN what appeared to be documentation that he was recommended for a Special Immigrant Visa by a US contractor with whom he worked in Afghanistan for almost two years. It was unclear whether that documentation is sufficient for what the State Department has required. He told CNN his daughter is growing anxious to leave.“She says, ‘You have [taken] me somewhere that I cannot see anywhere, I cannot go outside,’” the man said. “She’s asking me every time, frequently, ‘When are we going to get out of here?’”During the chaotic weeks of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, thousands of American military veterans rushed to help evacuate as many Afghans as possible.Among them was US Marine veteran Pete Lucier, who worked with a coalition of veterans’ groups known collectively as the #AfghanEvac coalition. Lucier said he is proud of much of the work that veteran and civilian volunteers did in helping Afghans flee the Taliban, which has since reinstated many of the draconian laws it had in place before the US and allied forces invaded after 9/11.Still, Lucier admitted there have been shortcomings, telling CNN that even well-intentioned veterans’ groups and individuals ended up “sometimes, unfortunately, making things worse for vulnerable and at-risk people.”Many of the individuals involved in evacuating Afghans had a “lack of familiarity with international law and the requirements of international travel,” Lucier said. “Broadly, I think EHC represents and embodies many of those challenges.”Dina Haynes, an international human rights lawyer and a professor at New England Law school in Boston, echoed those thoughts, saying that what has happened at EHC is “not a surprise at all to anybody who has paid attention” to the US immigration system.“The only people that it was a surprise to were those new people that showed up thinking that they could fly people out and land them somewhere and get the US government to help,” Haynes said.EHC is one of a few locations around the world where evacuated Afghans are still waiting to be processed for visas to the US or elsewhere. There are Afghans in Albania and Pakistan who were relocated there by private groups, as well as Afghans who were evacuated by the US government and are still being processed at Camp As-Sayliyah in Doha, Qatar, according to the State Department.Operated and funded by the UAE government, the EHC compound was first built in Abu Dhabi’s industrial Mussafah area to receive quarantine evacuees stranded in China following the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. After the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, thousands were evacuated to the compound as part of a wider regional humanitarian call to assist.That was in part due to an agreement made in August 2021 between UAE officials and Joseph Robert III, a former US Marine and son of a wealthy real estate investor with connections in the country.Robert’s group, the Black Feather Foundation, joined the #AfghanEvac coalition made up of roughly 200 nonprofits in November 2021. Robert told CNN that relationships with UAE officials who were close with his late father helped secure the agreement to bring Afghans to UAE, sealed by a memorandum of understanding, which, according to Robert, stated that the UAE would receive and temporarily house Afghan refugees until they were able to move on to a third country.The EHC compound was not specifically part of the agreement, Robert told CNN, but was chosen by the UAE because of its capacity.CNN visited the compound in August 2021, during the first days when Afghans were arriving. Afghans awaiting security and medical screenings were kept in assigned rooms until they were called for processing.UAE officials and US embassy personnel were present at the main center at EHC, where dozens of Afghan men and women sat awaiting information on their next destination. It was not immediately clear who was processing information from the evacuees.Robert said he has seen no signs of the alleged abuse taking place at EHC, which, he said, he visits every few weeks. He blames the US for not swiftly processing people out of EHC despite originally taking advantage of the extra hands that brought them there.“The US government was using us at every turn when it benefited them,” Robert said. “And then when it came time to do the work on the back end, to process them out, they tried to leave us high and dry.”Before going to Afghanistan in August 2021, Robert said he first flew to the UAE, where he had several meetings with officials about lining up commitments to take in refugees, as well as provide planes. When he finally landed at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan on August 20, 2021, things began to change immediately.“It became just an on-the-fly, ad hoc assistance operation,” Robert said, adding that, suddenly, “our planes were being loaded with just people from the airport that the US would have evacuated.”Afghan refugees arrived at EHC in three distinct groups. The first two groups were evacuated from the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021 by both the State Department and private groups working independently. The third group of Afghans were brought to EHC over the next two months by private groups, including Robert’s Black Feather Foundation, from Mazar-i-Sharif, a city roughly 260 miles from Kabul.The EHC resident who spoke to CNN said he was flown out of Mazar-i-Sharif with his family after attempting to get through crowds of people at the Kabul airport during the evacuation in August 2021. Despite concerns about traveling from Kabul, especially with the possibility of running into the Taliban on the way, the resident said he thought it might his best chance “to get myself and my family out of the danger zone.”Robert told CNN the manifests for those flights were submitted by other organizations either directly to him or through other members of his team. Robert said he then submitted the manifests to the UAE government, which ran them through its own security systems.It is almost entirely this group of people – those evacuated after August 2021 – that remains stuck at EHC, both the State Department and Robert said. In her responses to CNN, Tekach said the State Department “had limited information” about refugees who came on those separate flights. She also emphasized that that the place where people were evacuated from “is not a determining factor as to whether” they qualify for relocation and resettlement.Toward the end of October 2021, Robert said it was clear to him that the State Department was “not going to continue processing” any more people brought to the UAE since the evacuation had ended.“That’s where things with State Department started to unravel,” he said. “They processed only those that came on their aircraft, not even the ones that came on our aircraft alongside theirs during the [noncombatant evacuation]. As one State Department official told me, ‘Not our plane, not our problem.’”Tekach told CNN that the State Department paused processing in November 2021 “in support of US public health priorities” and began relocating individuals in March 2022.Still, Lucier told CNN that the US government and State Department likely were not clear enough in their communication about what private organizations could or could not do, leading to much of the confusion and at-times chaotic interference that occurred.Robert expressed frustration over security concerns the State Department has raised about the Afghans at EHC, saying that for the most part the evacuees are “able to provide everything they needed” in terms of paperwork and documents, including reference letters from US employers while in Afghanistan.While he acknowledged that there were shortcomings and mistakes made in the broader evacuation effort by private groups, Robert also said that was in part due to a “US government plan that was nonexistent.”All in all, Robert said volunteers were still able to evacuate “tens of thousands of individuals, despite the US government’s inability to appropriately evacuate them in the first place.”Asked how many State Department officials have access to EHC and how frequently they are at the compound working to process people out, the State Deaprtment’s Tekach said US officials have access to the compound “for a number of purposes, including gathering information to work on case processing and to support the well-being of the Afghan population at the facility.”Robert said that over the past six months, an average of three to five State Department personnel have come to EHC twice a week. After early frictions, Robert said his relationship with US government personnel who deal with EHC is “in a much better place now.”Despite the delays, Robert said they’re slowly making progress in resettling the Afghans still at EHC.“Having 20,000 people pass through the walls of EHC, and we’re down to the last 2,000 – that’s a rather remarkable effort, although things didn’t go as smoothly as we’d planned or hoped,” he said.“Even though everyone wants it to be faster, things are moving at a rather steady and consistent pace, and everyone’s still actively doing everything they can to find suitable pathways for people and accommodate families, and find other opportunities if a previous one falls through. Everyone is working tremendously hard to do what is right by these people,” Robert said.As the US and others work to process Afghans out, Human Rights Watch is still trying to bring attention to their plight.“They’re still in this facility, which was never designed to hold people for this long,” said Joey Shea, the lead researcher on HRW’s recent report. “And they’ve been effectively imprisoned after an extremely traumatic experience of fleeing a Taliban takeover.”Shea said the clearest solution is through the US government.“There just needs to be more resources put by the US government to make sure that these asylum and humanitarian parole and other applications are processed quickly,” she said.At EHC, the current resident who spoke to CNN described how happy he was to have been evacuated from Afghanistan in 2021.  Aside from marrying “the love of my life” and having children, he said that leaving Afghanistan was “the best day of my life.”“When the plane took off, I couldn’t fit in my own skin because of the happiness that I had,” he said emotionally. “This is a new life that I began to live with my family. I was happy and proud I could do something for my wife, my kids.”The recommendation letter he received from his US employer says he is “completely trustworthy, intelligent, and a faithful employee” and the “kind of person who will make a valuable contribution and service to the US, if allowed to immigrate.”But the longer he and his family languish at EHC, he said, the harder it is to explain his work with the US.“‘What will happen to us? Why are we abandoned by the US?’” he said his wife asks him. “My wife tells me that maybe it was not right that you worked for the US government.”",politics,0.0

The question was posed to him by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who participated in the mock sessions.“Obviously there is, I mean, I voted contrary to him in the Congress,” DeSantis said in the video. He added, “I have to frame it in a way that’s not going to piss off all of his voters.”DeSantis then said he does “what he thinks is right” and that he supports Trump’s agenda but added that any disagreement he may have with the then-president he would raise in private.Dave Abrams, a spokesman for DeSantis’ political team, slammed ABC News in a statement and said the footage proved “that Ron DeSantis is unwilling to be anyone but his authentic self – no matter the politics.”Gaetz, who has endorsed Trump’s 2024 campaign, condemned the leak of the tapes in a tweet on Sunday.The exchange caught on video shows how DeSantis strategized on how to embrace Trump and court his voters while also maintaining his own political identity. It’s a challenge the Florida governor is likely to face as he approaches a potential 2024 campaign against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.In another clip aired by ABC News, advisers off camera can be heard talking to DeSantis about the importance of coming off as likable and telling him to write the word “likable” in all caps on a pad of paper at the debate podium.“I do the same thing, cause I have the same personality, we’re both aggressive,” the unidentified adviser can be heard saying.Trump and his allies are treating the Republican governor as if he is already a candidate. Make America Great Again Inc., a Trump-aligned super PAC, has spent about $8.6 million on ads going after DeSantis. GOP primary polls continue to show Trump leading DeSantis by a healthy margin.On a recent international trade mission, a reporter in Tokyo asked DeSantis about Trump polling ahead of him. DeSantis visibly tensed before responding, “I’m not a candidate, so we’ll see if and when that changes.”",politics,0.0
67,72,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/politics/title-42-border-security-package-vote/index.html,House Republicans to vote Thursday on border security package as Title 42 ends,2023-05-07 14:19:00,"The House will vote on Republicans’ wide-ranging border security package on Thursday – the same day the Covid-era Title 42 policy that has enabled the US to swiftly expel certain migrants is set to expire, GOP leadership sources told CNN.The bill, known as HR 2, would codify some of the border programs implemented by former President Donald Trump, including the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which mandated that migrants stay in Mexico while going through the asylum process. It also would pour more resources into security at the southern border, restart bosrder wall construction, add more border personnel and upgrade border technology, among other provisions.Last month, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Republicans have the necessary votes to pass the legislation in the chamber, despite internal party divisions over how strict certain policies in the legislation should be.His comments followed weeks of intraparty negotiations that resulted in the softening of some provisions to get key members, such as Texas Reps. Chip Roy and Tony Gonzalez, and several moderate Republicans on board.Axios first reported that the vote would be held Thursday. The bill is unlikely to pass in the Democratic-led Senate.The timing of the vote is designed to directly coincide with the end of Title 42. The policy, first enacted by Trump and continued by President Joe Biden, has allowed border authorities to quickly turn away migrants, citing a public health emergency.But on Thursday, when the coronavirus public health emergency ends, authorities will have to return to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere, raising concerns within the administration about a surge in the immediate aftermath of Title 42 lifting.Lawmakers in both parties have been sounding the alarm over the expected influx of migrants and have criticized the Biden administration for not being more prepared for the deadline.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who caucuses with Democrats, introduced a bill last week that would temporarily extend some provisions covered by Title 42 and give the Biden administration more flexibility in how it handles migrants at the border, such as granting the White House a two-year expulsion authority that would apply to migrants trying to enter the US illegally.But Tillis acknowledged that the bill can’t become law before Title 42 is lifted on Thursday.Meanwhile, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday defended the Biden administration’s preparedness and outreach for the lifting of Title 42.“It’s going to take our plan a while to really take hold, for people to understand that they can access lawful, safe, orderly pathways before they reach the border,” he told “Face the Nation” on CBS. “And quite frankly, if they come to the border, they will receive a consequence under our enforcement authorities.”“We are prepared,” Mayorkas said.",politics,0.0

In March, Beijing mediated a landmark agreement between archfoes Iran and Saudi Arabia that could help significantly ease regional tensions. Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the US has become strained in recent years, while China’s standing has risen.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy cautioned Israel in a speech before the Knesset last week to be wary of Chinese investment in the country.“While the [Chinese Communist Party] may disguise itself as promoters of innovation, and, true, they act like seeds, we must not allow them to steal our technology,” the California Republican said.Analysts, however, have said that the Middle East is unlikely to become an arena for the US-Chinese rivalry, given Beijing’s economy-oriented focus and its aversion to playing regional politics.Washington and Beijing have had tumultuous relations over the past year. Tensions soared following a visit to Taiwan last summer by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and after a Chinese surveillance balloon traversed the US, leading US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to call off a planned visit to China.US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said last week that the United States was “ready to talk” to China and expressed hope that Beijing would “meet us halfway on this.”In his interview with Tapper, Turner declined to comment on the domestic turmoil over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposed judicial overhaul, saying, “Our focus, largely, being from the Intelligence Committee, were on the relations between the United States and Israel and how we can help strengthen the security situation in the area.”Iran remains a concern for Netanyahu, both Intelligence leaders said.“With Iran so brutally abusing its own people, I think the prospect for negotiation is arguably further away than ever before,” Himes said when asked about Iran’s nuclear program. “We’re in a little bit of a fix right now because we don’t have a lot of leverage.”Turner said Netanyahu had made clear in their meeting that he thinks Iran can be deterred.“If they do believe that there will be military action against them, a surgical-type strike that would diminish their ability to pursue nuclear weapons, that that could have a chilling effect and could stall their programming. And he doesn’t want that opportunity to be missed,” the Ohio Republican said.Efforts to try to restore the Iran nuclear agreement remain halted, and Tehran continues to breach the restrictions set out by the deal.A top US Defense official warned earlier this year that Iran’s ability to build a nuclear bomb was accelerating. The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has reported that uranium particles enriched to near bomb-grade levels were found in January at an Iranian nuclear facility.",politics,0.0

Day after day, week after week, more and more disclosures about Justice Thomas – we cannot ignore them,” the Illinois Democrat told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”“The thing we’re going to do first, obviously, is to gather the evidence, the information that we need to draw our conclusions. I’m not ruling out anything,” he added.ProPublica reported recently that, for years, Thomas has accepted lavish trips and gifts from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow, which have gone mostly unreported on the justice’s financial disclosures. Crow also purchased several real estate properties, including the home where Thomas’ mother lives, from the Thomas family and paid boarding school tuition for Thomas’ grandnephew, according to ProPublica.The extent to which these transactions and hospitality should have been reported by Thomas has been the subject of debate among judicial ethics experts, who have noted that a recently closed loophole for certain “personal hospitality” may have covered some of the luxury trips.Thomas has said he followed the advice of others in deciding what required disclosure and, in a statement last month, noted that that Crow did not have business before the court.But Durbin said Sunday the recent revelations “just embarrasses me” as he called on Chief Justice John Roberts to impose a code of conduct on the court. Roberts previously declined Durbin’s request to voluntarily testify in a hearing on Supreme Court ethics.“I must respectfully decline your invitation,” Roberts wrote in a letter to Durbin, which was released by a spokesperson for the high court. “Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the Chief Justice of the United States is exceedingly rare as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence.”The debate over Supreme Court ethics was the subject of a Senate Judiciary hearing last week that featured testimony from a law professor, legal advocates and two former judges. Some Republican lawmakers said they want to see more transparency around the court, though they railed against the Democratic push for Congress to impose a code of conduct on the justices.Durbin maintained Sunday that “this is the Roberts court, and history is going to judge him by the decision he makes on this.”“He has the power to make the difference.”Durbin made clear Sunday that he hasn’t reached “any conclusion” on pursuing subpoenas in relation toSupreme Court ethics issues, but he acknowledged that the absence of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein of California would pose a challenge to the committee “if we go down that path.”“Right now, with her absence, it’s a 10-to-10 Committee, and the majority is not there, and a proxy vote doesn’t count in this circumstance,” Durbin said.Feinstein, 89, has been away from the Senate since March as she recovers at home in California from shingles. Her absence has prevented the committee from advancing certain judicial nominees of President Joe Biden and several House Democrats have called on her to resign as a result.In a statement last week, Feinstein pushed back on those claims, saying that the Senate continues to “swiftly” confirm “highly qualified individuals to the federal judiciary.” She indicated in the statement that she still plans to return but did not say when that would happen.“She’s gone through an awful lot. She lost her husband last year, and she’s had some real medical issues that are problematic for her at her age at this point,” Durbin said. “I hope she returns, and I hope it’s this week. We need her. It is a challenge in the Senate Judiciary Committee to do our business.”The situation, he added, is “complicated.”“I hope she does what’s best for her and her family and the state of California and makes a decision soon as to whether she’s coming back,” Durbin said.This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0

Mike Lee of Utah, said they are “united behind the House Republican conference in support of spending cuts and structural budget reform as a starting point for negotiations on the debt ceiling” in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.The letter underscores the deep rift in Washington over how to avoid a debt default. Republicans have repeatedly advocated spending cuts tied to the debt ceiling while the White House has maintained it will not negotiate on the matter.Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Kennedy of Louisiana are the only Republicans in the chamber to not sign on to the letter.A breach of the US debt ceiling risks sparking a 2008-style economic catastrophe that wipes out millions of jobs and sets America back for generations, Moody’s Analytics has warned. The impact could include delayed Social Security payments, late paychecks for federal employees and veterans and a direct hit to Americans’ investments.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the US could default on its debt as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t act.“Our economy is in free fall due to unsustainable fiscal policies,” the senators write in the letter. “This trajectory must be addressed with fiscal reforms. Moreover, recent Treasury projections have reinforced the urgency of addressing the debt ceiling. The House has taken a responsible first step in coming to the table with their proposals. It is imperative that the president now do the same.”“As such, we will not be voting for cloture on any bill that raises the debt ceiling without substantive spending and budget reforms,” they add.The White House fired back Saturday, accusing the Republican senators of holding the economic livelihood of millions of Americans hostage.“At a moment when the country just posted historic jobs gains, this is no time for these Senators to reverse their support for avoiding default without conditions during the Trump presidency,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement. “They need to honor their Constitutional obligation to pay our bills and not unilaterally inflict a recession on the country.”“The American people would not stand for that threat under any circumstances, but especially not to allow the draconian cuts in the House bill that would throw veterans, law enforcement, manufacturing workers, and sick children under the bus,” Bates added.President Joe Biden is set to sit down with McCarthy, a California Republican, and other congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss raising the debt ceiling.Earlier this week, the White House expressed openness to a short-term fix to the debt ceiling but later walked back the position.Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young reiterated to reporters this week that the administration’s position remains that “It is Congress’ duty to ensure we don’t default.”“Congress can put a bill on the floor tomorrow, avoid default,” Young said during a White House briefing Thursday. “The DC drama, the political brinksmanship. That’s what that is. Nothing is preventing Congress from moving to avoid default. And they need to do that, whether it’s tomorrow or next week.”This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
72,77,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/title-42-border-what-matters/index.html,Why the US expects a border surge and is deploying troops,2023-05-05 16:46:00,"The layer of duct tape that has been holding up US immigration policy will be ripped off, and nobody seems completely ready for what’s next:The surge of migrants is expected because Title 42, the Trump-era policy that allowed the government to quickly turn away certain migrants at the border during the Covid-19 pandemic, is expiring.It was kept in place by courts and used by the Biden administration.Title 42 officially ends on May 11, when the Covid-19 public health emergency lapses.Encounters between US border agents and undocumented immigrants had fallen early this year but have recently increased. They are at around 7,000 per day at the moment and are expected to rise dramatically, despite a warning from the State Department and DHS about a new, more punitive policy related to border crossings.The additional 1,500 active-duty troops being dispatched for 90 days by the Pentagon will join around 2,500 National Guard troops already on the border. They are meant to act in strictly administrative roles and not to aid in law enforcement, according to CNN’s report.These deployments are not unprecedented in recent years, but this one is notable since it coincides with an expected surge of border encounters.The administration has tried to discourage migrants from simply crossing the border and promised that people apprehended will be turned away and potentially barred from reentry.The US is working with Colombia and Guatemala to set up regional processing centers to allow migrants to apply to come to the US before they attempt the grueling journey through Central America and Mexico.“The idea is, of course, that people will not continue their journey over land,” a senior administration official told CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez recently. “The whole idea of regional processing centers is to give people a lawful, safe, regular way to enter the United States.”But there are already more than 36,000 migrants, according to estimates, camped along the border in northern Mexico waiting for the end of Title 42.The State Department and DHS have urged those people to use a mobile app to make an appointment at a port of entry rather than trying to cross the border.Once Title 42 lapses, the US will return to using what’s known as Title 8 authority to remove anyone who arrives at the border unlawfully and bar them from reentering the US for at least five years, a more punitive approach.A major difference after Title 42 lapses is that asylum-seekers who cross the border without first applying for asylum will be removed under that Title 8 authority, along with a newly proposed regulation, according to the State Department. Immigration advocates are confounded since the Trump administration proposed a similar plan.The government has pledged to increase the number of refugees allowed into the US and is pushing applicants to use those regional centers rather than travel all the way to the border.There are also asylum-seekers already inside the US.CNN’s Rosa Flores recently reported from the streets of El Paso, Texas, where crowds of people had been moved from sleeping on the street to make way for a twice-daily run-through by the city’s sanitation services. El Paso has declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the end of Title 42.Flores said it’s mostly men sleeping on the street and that families with children are crowding shelters that have been set up in the city.From border towns, asylum-seekers hope to get a ride closer to relatives or acquaintances who live in the country.CNN recently talked to a Haitian family – 28-year-old Dieuvena, her husband Banel and their 4-year-old son Matéo Sebastien – struggling to find a place to stay in Boston. After staying in a hospital, the family has had a hard time finding a place to sleep.Texas has been transporting thousands of migrants to cities like New York, Chicago and Washington, DC.New York City Mayor Eric Adams has asked the federal government to stop giving Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to the Texas border cities using federal dollars to rent buses and ship migrants farther north.More than 50,000 asylum-seekers have arrived since last spring, according to a separate report by CNN’s Alvarez, Mark Morales and Gregory Krieg.They wrote:But what was originally seen as a stunt or political provocation – intended to expose what conservatives describe as hypocrisy among immigrant-friendly Democratic leaders – has mushroomed into a crisis for Adams, who is desperately seeking federal aid. Advocates’ anger over the treatment of the migrants by the city, which initially set up tent camps as shelters, is creating pressure from the left on a mayor who is now threatening budget cuts to everything from libraries to the fire department and Department of Homeless Services.Adams also accused Texas Gov. Greg Abbott of only sending migrants to cities with Black mayors.“Governor Abbott sent asylum seekers to NY – Black mayor; to Washington – Black mayor; to Houston – Black mayor; to Los Angeles – Black mayor; to Denver – Black mayor. He passed over thousands of cities to land here,” Adams said at a recent news conference on an unrelated topic.“I cannot ignore the fact that Gov. Abbott sent migrants only to cities where there are Black mayors, and it’s undermining our cities,” he added.Abbott, unapologetic for targeting certain cities that pledged to be immigrant sanctuaries with busloads of migrants, has argued the larger problem is on the border.The men both want help from the federal government, but they have very different ideas about what that help would look like.Adams wants the federal government to help deal with asylum-seekers already in the US in a more orderly and fair way. Abbott wants the federal government to repel people at the border.There’s a larger point here: Current immigration policy is about to change in a material way not because a reasoned debate led to legislation – Congress is not seriously debating immigration at the moment – but rather because the public health emergency is officially ending.One thing that would help the immigration policy is clarity, according to Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.“Clearly there’s significant policy change that is needed at the US-Mexico border; one that actually starts with increasing and providing better assistance for US asylum claims, one that is more fair and transparent about who can come to the country and seek asylum in which ways,” he told CNN’s Rosemary Church.There’s also very clearly a need for better coordination between the local, state and federal governments about how to treat people already in the US.It’s a great irony of the US political debate that immigration drives such a visceral divide since the country needs immigrants – both to address labor shortages and to shore up the social safety net programs that are running out of funding.",politics,0.0
73,78,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/trump-january-6-proud-boys-convictions/index.html,Fresh January 6 convictions raise the stakes for Trump,2023-05-05 04:22:00,"A Washington jury put down a marker that could protect generations of future elections by finding four Proud Boys extremists guilty of the seditious conspiracy of trying to violently thwart the transfer of presidential power.But what about the next election?Thursday’s verdict only added to the intrigue surrounding the gravest legal and political unknown from the 2021 Capitol insurrection that hangs over the 2024 campaign: will Donald Trump, the president who inspired the uprising, face his own legal and political price?This is not simply vital to the question of whether justice applies equally to everyone in society, no matter how powerful they might be. It’s also fundamental to the historical accounting still unfolding over one of the most flagrant attacks on American democracy and may go some way to undermining Republican efforts to blur the truth of what happened on that terrible day.But the legal uncertainty facing Trump – who appears in jeopardy in multiple investigations springing from his election denialism and other alleged transgressions – comes with a related political question. Even if the ex-president is charged with trying to overthrow the core principle of democracy – the peaceful transfer of power – will it ultimately hurt his 2024 campaign?The former president is betting that it won’t. He’s spent two years denying the truth of January 6 and has anchored his 2024 campaign for a non-consecutive second term to the premise that he was illegally ousted from power in 2020. If the nascent Republican nominating contest is any guide, Trump’s legacy of disgrace is unlikely to scare off Republican primary voters, many of whom seem to be warming to him after his slow start. And that’s despite his indictment in a hush money case in New York. (He’s pleaded not guilty to charges of falsifying business records.)President Joe Biden, however, has made a counter bet. The first scene of his reelection announcement video released last month showed smoke rising over the US Capitol and rioters with Trump flags. Whatever the liabilities of his own bid, including his advanced age, low approval ratings and an unpredictable economy, the current commander in chief is beseeching Americans not to trust their democracy to a predecessor who came close to overturning it in early 2021.Given the fraught situation, the Justice Department’s next moves will be hugely significant.“Today’s verdict makes clear the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said after prosecutors secured convictions against the Proud Boys extremists in a historic case Thursday.But Garland walked away from the cameras and didn’t take a question – presumably because he’s not yet ready to answer the one that is on the nation’s lips, about Trump.In cases directly related to the 2020 election, the former president is being investigated by special counsel Jack Smith over his actions running up to the insurrection. He’s also waiting to find out whether he and his political cronies will be charged in an investigation in Fulton County, Georgia, over his attempt to steal Biden’s victory in the Peach State.Thursday’s Proud Boys convictions are among the most significant of hundreds of successful Justice Department prosecutions of people linked to the US Capitol riot. Five leaders and one associate of another extremist group – the Oath Keepers – were earlier found guilty of seditious conspiracy in separate cases. All of those convicted potentially face decades in jail. Nearly 600 rioters have been convicted and more than 235 have been sent to prison on lesser charges.This record bolsters Garland’s promise that the assault on US democracy would be punished. But it also begs the question why Trump, who inspired the rioters and has convinced millions of his supporters that he actually won an election he lost, has not faced similar accountability.“Who is the single most powerful person who Merrick Garland has charged in connection with January 6? Nobody,” said CNN legal analyst Elie Honig on Thursday, channeling frustration among some experts with the slow pace of investigations into Trump and his associates.So could the ex-president – who called a crowd to Washington on the day that the 2020 election was due to be certified in Congress, fired supporters up with lies about election fraud and told them to “fight like hell” before they marched on the Capitol – also be charged? And since prosecutors referred to the Proud Boys convicted on Thursday as “Trump’s army” and said that they appeared to see him as their leader and his rhetoric as a call to action, could he also be looking at a charge as serious as seditious conspiracy?“Donald Trump lit the flame. The Proud Boys were the flame,” former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.”Seditious conspiracy, a charge that dates from the post-Civil War period, is rarely used and hard to prove. Prosecutors effectively had to show that two or more people had conspired to overthrow, put down or destroy by force the US government. They used a trove of text messages, video and other material to build the chain of conspiracy that convinced the jury.Using the same charge against Trump would be complicated unless the special counsel has amassed evidence that shows that the ex-president genuinely plotted with others to incite violence against the government when his vice president was inside the Capitol presiding over the certification of Biden’s victory. It won’t be enough to simply draw a line between Trump’s apparent incitement of the crowd to events that happened next.“The challenge whenever you are establishing a conspiracy is you have to have an agreement between two parties,” CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams said. “Finding an agreement between the former president and the people who were there on that day is just going to be exceptionally difficult.”Still, the defendants found guilty of seditious conspiracy on Thursday – longtime Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl – were also found guilty of a range of other charges, including three separate conspiracy charges, obstructing the Electoral College vote and tampering with evidence. So while a prosecution of Trump and his closest political associates over January 6 could be tough, it may not be impossible. In fact, Tarrio was not even on the Capitol grounds when the insurrection took place – a fact that could chill those in Trump’s camp.A lawyer for Rehl told CNN’s Katelyn Polantz after the verdict that what Trump did or didn’t do was of “no moment” to her or her client. She added, however: “But he was the one who called the rally and had everyone show up.”Any legal moves will take place in a highly sensitive political context. After all, the next election is unfolding while a former president and current presidential candidate is being investigated over alleged crimes by the Justice Department of his successor’s administration.The lesson of the ex-president’s career in business and politics is that he’s an expert at avoiding legal accountability and that scandals – any one of which would have ended a normal political career – seem to wash off his back.It’s fair to ask, however, whether that is now changing because his potential legal liability goes beyond cases related to the 2020 election.Smith is also pursuing a possible case of infringing the Espionage Act and obstruction in an investigation over classified documents Trump hoarded at Mar-a-Lago. In a possible sign of his increasing vulnerability on this matter, two Trump Organization executives were due to appear before a federal grand jury investigating the case Thursday, after CNN exclusively reported Smith is asking questions about the handling of surveillance footage from the Florida resort. And in another extraordinary drama that reflects the staggering legal clouds hanging over Trump – but that might also end up demonstrating the extent of his political impunity among his voters – a jury in a civil case is being asked to decide whether Trump raped former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in the mid 1990s and then defamed her. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)Both Biden and some of Trump’s potential 2024 primary opponents, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have made the case overtly or implicitly that this catalog of suspicion – not to mention the chaos it could cause during the campaign and potentially in a second Trump term – is more than enough to disqualify him from the presidency. And after his loss in 2020 and the defeat of many of his hand-picked candidates in last fall’s midterms, there’s reason to believe a national electorate could again reject the former president because of his conduct, character and his ongoing obsession with the last presidential election.It’s a different story among the GOP base, which is still loyal to him. In an NBC News poll released last week, 68% of Republican primary voters agreed with the statement that investigations against him “are a politically motivated attempt to stop Trump. No other candidate is like him, we must support him.”The ex-president, who will appear in a CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday, has made some effective moves in seeking to wound DeSantis, his former protégé, who trails him in early polling. There’s plenty of time for the race to change – and for DeSantis, who hasn’t yet launched a bid, to overcome some rocky moments in recent weeks. But the ex-president’s team looks to be running a more disciplined operation than his chaotic White House often did.Trump’s demagogic and anti-democratic rhetoric at his campaign rallies, however, refutes any notion that he would be less threatening to American democracy in a second term.But that’s a direct appeal to his followers.

And the universe of people convicted for trying to undermine the 2020 election grows.Pulling in another direction, former President Donald Trump, the person who inspired the Capitol riot and tried to undo the election, is growing stronger as the odds-on frontrunner to be the Republican nominee for president next year.If you’re wondering how it would be possible for the federal government to prosecute the person who is one of two main people with a chance to lead it, you’ve hit on the unanswerable and unprecedented question that could cause so much chaos as the republic prepares to consider transferring power again.The Department of Justice has moved methodically but very slowly as it brings increasingly serious cases against riot ringleaders.That means that as special counsel Jack Smith considers what, if any, charges the government should bring against Trump for events surrounding the 2020 election, he will have to contend with the reality of the former president’s political power.Most Republicans – 73% in one recent CBS News poll – would consider Trump as their nominee; should they have that right to vote him into office in a free republic? Or should charges, if they are warranted, be brought anyway, even years after the fact?There was not enough political support to bar Trump from office through an impeachment trial when he was president. Would things be different in a criminal trial?Juries have shown a willingness to find people guilty of the complicated and hard-to-prove charges related to January 6. Four leaders of the far-right group Proud Boys were found guilty Thursday of seditious conspiracy in connection with the January 6 insurrection.They join five members and one associate of another far-right militia group, the Oath Keepers, found guilty by DC juries of the same charge in separate cases resolved last November and this January.None of these convicts have yet been sentenced, but they could face decades in prison.The conspiracy portion of their crimes did not necessarily involve action on January 6, 2021. The Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was not even in DC on January 6; he had been ordered to leave town after being arrested with high-capacity rifle magazines two days before.A fifth Proud Boys defendant, Dominic Pezzola, who used a stolen police shield to break through a window at the Capitol, was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy, but was convicted, along with the other four Proud Boys, of other charges.The following insights come from CNN’s report by Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand on Thursday’s convictions.Proud Boys planned for overthrow:Text and Signal messages highlighted in the indictment suggest that Tarrio was preparing for a “revolution,” and reviewed documents that set forth a plan to occupy a few “crucial buildings” in Washington, including House and Senate office buildings around the Capitol. …During the trial, using messages and videos posted by the defendants and other members of the group, prosecutors laid out the case that the Proud Boys, animated by Trump and his election lies after the 2020 defeat, began calling for violence and revolution against the incoming Biden presidency.Some were on the front lines of the riot:Proud Boys were at the front lines of the mob on Capitol grounds and were there when the first barriers were breached. Prosecutors have alleged that leaders of the group riled members up and communicated with them, through hand signals, to move ahead.This was a longer-than-expected process:The countless delays, brought on by newly unveiled evidence and informants, a juror who believed they were being followed, and internecine squabbles among attorneys pushed a trial originally estimated to last five to seven weeks to stretch across four months.I asked CNN’s Marshall Cohen what we know about the universe of people charged and convicted for involvement in January 6. Combining data from the Justice Department and CNN, he offered this:The charges so far have focused on the riot and its planning rather than the inspiration Trump provided to stop the counting of electoral votes and his effort to overturn the election. The investigation into Trump, led by Smith, is still underway.The major development on that front is that former Vice President Mike Pence, a potential Trump rival for the 2024 GOP nomination, sat for hours of testimony before a grand jury in Washington.Smith attended that testimony in person, according to CNN’s exclusive report on the development from Kristen Holmes, Jamie Gangel and Katelyn Polantz.From the CNN report:Pence was poised to recount for the first time under oath his direct conversations with Trump leading up to January 6, 2021. Then-President Donald Trump repeatedly pressured him unsuccessfully to block the 2020 election results, including on the morning of January 6 in a private phone call.A federal judge previously ruled Pence could be compelled to recount conversations the two men had where Trump may have been acting corruptly. Smith’s office had fought in sealed proceedings to force Pence to testify.Trump clearly has other legal problems too. Smith is also investigating the mishandling of classified documents found at the former president’s Mar-a-Lago resort (President Joe Biden is the subject of a separate inquiry related to classified documents). And Trump is under indictment in New York for charges related to alleged hush-money payments that date back to the 2016 presidential election.Rather than wound his political prospects, however, none of these developments have led Republican voters to move on.

Millions of smartphones flash with news of the latest horror. Video shows police storming into another building and snaking lines of survivors being rushed to safety. Soon, muted TVs playing cable news in tire shops, bars and airports nationwide show speeding ambulances and white-coated hospital spokespeople briefing on trauma injuries. It may be a day before the family snapshots of the victims emerge.Mass shootings end lives in a senseless instant. Survivors may take months to recover, if they ever do. And the agony of those close to the victims will never end. But for most of the rest of the country, life goes on, because there’s no other way.On Wednesday, it was the turn of Atlanta, Georgia, where a gunman became enraged during a visit to a midtown medical facility, allegedly shooting dead at least one person with a handgun and injuring four others before he was caught hours later after a manhunt.Georgia state Sen. Josh McLaurin was in midtown for lunch, when he suddenly found himself faced with a frightening emergency that more and more Americans are experiencing.“In the middle of lunch, I just started hearing people say, ‘Hey, we are on lockdown, there is an active shooter next door,”’ McLaurin, a Democrat, told CNN’s Jake Tapper.“The thing I was overwhelmed by today is this is how people are expected to live now. You could just go out to lunch or go to the doctor’s office, or go to daycare which is nearby and drop your kid off and you have got a lockdown that lasts most of the day and (are) covered by this fear and uncertainty about what is happening to your loved ones,” McLaurin said.Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens warned Thursday that this new reality must not be allowed to prevail.“We cannot accept mass shootings as normal in our country,” Dickens wrote in an open letter to his city. “While we respect the rights conveyed by the 2nd Amendment, we also need more actions to protect the rights of our citizens to go about their lives — to go to a doctor’s office, a supermarket, a gas station, their school — without the threat of being gunned down.”It’s hard to keep all the different shootings in all the different towns straight.Days ago, Cleveland, Texas, joined the roster of random death, after an armed man shot dead five people in a neighborhood dispute. The killing spree was triggered when a family asked the man to stop firing his gun in his yard. This came after horror unfolded in Louisville, Kentucky, and Nashville, Tennessee in recent weeks. On a single weekend last month, there were mass shootings spanning six states, killing at least 10 people. In Dadeville, Alabama, the futility of senseless violence raging out of control was underscored by carnage at a Sweet 16 party, when four people were shot dead and at least 32 others were wounded.But the attention quickly shifted, as it always does, to the next mass shooting, leaving the bereaved and injured to pick up their broken lives.Had any of these events been caused by a foreign terrorist organization, or an overseas adversary, they might have spurred a national push for action. But in America, mass shootings are part of the background noise of daily life. They are part of the national reality – almost like bad weather – that causes people to shudder and hope it doesn’t affect their neighborhoods or their families before they carry on with their lives.There is strong support for some gun safety measures, like tightening background checks and, among Democrats, an assault-style weapons ban. But the reality of divided power in Washington means that the chances of enacting change are very low. Many Republicans see any gun control measures as tantamount to a complete repudiation of the Second Amendment. And several GOP presidential candidates, including ex-President Donald Trump, are placing gun rights at the center of their campaigns while many GOP-led state legislatures are loosening gun laws.The apparent low prospects of any action to stem endless violence means that some political reaction after gun massacres is becoming as routine as the tragedies themselves. Rote tweets from GOP lawmakers offering “thoughts and prayers” for gun violence victims became a cliché. Now the same can be said of post-mass shooting warnings from Democrats that “thoughts and prayers are not enough.” Debates about better mental health care and “red flag” laws that might save some lives are becoming just as wearied by repetition.Majorities of Americans might be open to some limited changes, but most also know the polarized politics of the right to bear arms – an existential part of national identity for many Americans – means that even rudimentary reforms are unlikely.So the new national reality prevails: Anywhere – a school, a backyard, a bar, a medical office or a bank – can suddenly become the latest backdrop for the gun violence epidemic. Nowhere is safe in a nation with more firearms than people. What all this does to the psyche of a country may become clear in the years ahead. Already, a generation of kids has grown up scarred by active shooter drills and the fear that their school might be next.Tyrisia Woods, who was in the Atlanta medical facility where the shots were fired on Wednesday, summed up the latent fear many Americans feel when she told CNN she had not felt safe coming into work because her building lacked metal detectors.“We have active shooters in Midtown so often, our buildings are locked down a lot,” Woods said. “I just really feel unsafe working in that area.”In another sign of America’s mass shooting reality, surgeons spoke again on Wednesday of how they modified medical procedures and prepared detailed plans for mass casualty events – one of which swung quickly into action in Atlanta.Dr. Robert Jansen, chief medical officer of Grady Health System, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that as soon as the first reports of a mass shooting emerged, doctors, nurses, trauma surgeons and respiratory therapists went on alert and operating rooms were opened.“When these types of events happen, unfortunately we have to be prepared, and we were prepared,” Jansen said.It won’t be long before the events in Atlanta on Wednesday – or those at a bank in Louisville last month – will play out somewhere else.Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, who lost her 17-year-old son to gun violence in 2012, said on CNN’s “The Situation Room”: “I don’t know how much more blood and carnage my colleagues in Washington and also in state legislatures all around the country have to see. What more does it take?”Judging by this week, America’s reality isn’t about to change soon.",politics,0.0
76,81,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/politics/san-francisco-crime-rate-what-matters/index.html,What’s really going on with crime in San Francisco?,2023-05-03 17:37:00,"Another big American retailer announced it was pulling out of downtown San Francisco.Nordstrom blamed flagging foot traffic and the “dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market” when it announced it would not renew the lease on its massive retail location as well as its discount outlet in the heart of the city.Numerous other brands have also said they will pull out of the area. In April, Whole Foods temporarily shut a flagship store that opened just last year, citing worker safety.What’s happening in San Francisco has become a key storyline in a larger national narrative about crime and perceptions of crime.It’s a storyline that CNN reporter Kyung Lah experienced back in March when she and a crew went to San Francisco to report on how crime has scrambled the city’s politics. Last November, voters in the majority-Asian American Sunset District replaced a progressive Chinese American incumbent for supervisor with a moderate White man, Joel Engardio.“San Francisco, the most liberal place in America, is saying enough. We want safe streets. We want good schools,” Engardio told Lah during an interview at City Hall. “That should tell anyone – pay attention.”Proving the point, the window of the car rented by Lah and her crew was being smashed and their bags grabbed as she conducted that interview. It happened in about four seconds, Lah said, and despite the fact that the CNN crew had hired professional security to watch their car. Watch her report.Lah told me officers from the San Francisco Police Department ultimately recovered her emptied bags and passport.For a better sense of what exactly is going on in one of the world’s great cities, I talked to Joe Eskenazi, managing editor and columnist for Mission Local, an independent, nonprofit news site. Full disclosure: Joe and I went to college together in the Bay Area and were colleagues at The Daily Californian. Excerpts of our conversation are below.WOLF: I’m out here on the East Coast. I see that businesses like Nordstrom and Whole Foods are leaving downtown San Francisco, and there is this theme that crime is driving them away. What’s your view?ESKENAZI: There is crime in downtown San Francisco, but there always has been.I think the notion that these businesses were driven out by crime is frankly dishonest. That’s always been a factor. But it wasn’t like Mid-Market (where the Nordstrom is located) was a serene place before the pandemic.I think the Nordstrom people were very responsible in what they said. The letter that was sent to everybody was very upfront that there was decreased foot traffic. They weren’t making money.It wasn’t good business for them anymore. And Nordstrom, in fact, closed their Stonestown Mall outlet in 2019, which is a mall more in the periphery of San Francisco.So the problem here is that your big, high-end, mall-type retail is dying. It was already having lots of trouble before the pandemic and that kind of greased the skids. That’s a big problem for downtown San Francisco. It’s hundreds of thousands of square feet of retail space that’s suddenly going to go vacant.To say it was chased out by crime is a preferred narrative of people for their own worldview.I just looked back and found an article that I wrote in 2014 about complaints that one out of every four police calls in that district was in or near the Westfield Mall. That was there before.WOLF: There’s a tendency, if you’re looking from outside of San Francisco in, to try to connect dots between different stories. There’s the murder of a tech executive, the election of a more moderate city council, the recall of the district attorney there. There are reports about skyscrapers that are essentially vacant right now. There’s this perception that the inside of the city is being hollowed out.ESKENAZI: That’s true, but that doesn’t have anything to do with crime. That has to do with the fact that the entire inside of the city was devoted to office space for businesses that are now going remote and cutting down.People have different opinions on this, but I feel like it’s kind of asking a lot for the city to have 2020 hindsight. You can see where the city made itself vulnerable, devoting so much space to office space exclusively.And in this case, tech companies were so flush that they alone could afford to buy up that office space, and in fact bought it up when it was still even conceptual office space. So like 100% of the vacancies were going to tech.When tech workers dictated that they would rather be working from home or working a combination, that’s what happened. If you go to the Financial District now – it’s not nearly as bad as everyone would think. There are still people around. It’s just not crowded. And it hollows out very quickly once working hours are done.But that’s always how it was. I think office vacancies speak for themselves.We’re going to see how bad it really is when rents come down. A lot of the people who own those buildings are extremely leveraged and can’t afford to lower rents. So rents are still higher than in other cities nearby and in competing cities.You’re not going to get new people with those rates. Sooner or later people are going to have to bite the bullet and decide they want the building to be largely full at a lower rate or largely empty at a higher rate.And then we’re going to see if other types of businesses move in – the types of businesses San Francisco economically banished a long time ago.WOLF: A separate issue than crime, but potentially related, is homelessness. We’ve written more about that, certainly, with regard to Los Angeles, but I wonder what it’s like from a perspective of running into a large number of people who are unhoused on the streets. Is that changing the perceptions in the city?ESKENAZI: There have always been large numbers of unhoused people in San Francisco. The difference now is that with fewer people downtown, a higher percentage of people you see are visibly homeless.What’s more, there are more overtly miserable people out than there used to be, for lack of a better word. You’re seeing more chaotic, horrific conditions.You earlier mentioned crime, and in people’s minds, being uneasy about drug use in the streets or antisocial behavior is equated in their minds with crime. People feel uneasy, and that’s understandable.But this feeling of uneasiness does not square with crime. If you take a step back, statistically, that’s the case. San Francisco has lots of overt misery, lots of overt drug use, lots of things that you wish you didn’t see and that the city should be dealing with in ways other than tossing people in jail or pushing them into neighboring counties.San Francisco also has lots of property crime because there’s a great divergence of wealth and people steal things. But San Francisco’s violent crime rate is at a near historic low right now.This dynamic was on full display when it was just assumed that tech mogul Bob Lee was stabbed to death by a homeless crazy, and it turns out that the man in custody is a fellow tech executive.We have a big problem with the future of downtown and how it’s going to be productive and provide the tax revenue that this city depends upon. The departures of our big anchor businesses because it’s no longer profitable – that’s a big problem. It is separate and apart from the perception that it’s “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” here on the city streets, which just really isn’t true.WOLF: Perception can lead to change, though, even if it isn’t specifically reality. How is the perception of the city as Thunderdome going to affect the politics there? People’s willingness to live there? If you describe a sense of uneasiness, even though that might not mean more crime, it sounds like a not-pleasant place to be.ESKENAZI: I think it’s definitely going to have its effect on how things are done in San Francisco, but we’re going to have to see what that looks like.I’d say that half-formed “solutions” meant to address something that isn’t statistically a problem are not going to have happy outcomes. You know, calling in the Highway Patrol and the National Guard to deal with our horrible drug addiction problem isn’t going to do much if it’s all for show, even if they get out on the streets and start collaring drug users and tossing them in jail.We’re currently arresting narcotics criminals at about one-ninth of volume that district attorney (now Vice President) Kamala Harris presided over during prior police administrations. The tough parts of downtown were still tough back then. There was still a lot of overt drug use and misery.The drugs are different now. The drugs are more dangerous now. But it would be very hard to just patrol and arrest your way out of this problem. It’s going to take more thorough, complete solutions.I’m not really even seeing the willingness to have honest discussions about this, because the whole premise is being taken and grabbed and run with in a dishonest way.WOLF: What am I missing?ESKENAZI: I think that people are scared and people are uneasy and people are fed up.But that’s different than saying OK, we’re just gonna hire more cops or OK, we’re going to just do something simple. These are complicated problems. And San Francisco can’t solve some of America’s problems.One of the reasons in San Francisco you see people shooting drugs on the street is because in other parts of the country, those people can afford to be inside.San Francisco has land-use issues and housing issues. Land use is a bit like sand; it gets into everything here. Every discussion ends up coming back to that, which is very unsatisfactory and makes it very hard to solve problems.A (former New York City Mayor Rudy) Giuliani type situation of just like booting misery and overt antisocial behavior into the next county isn’t going to end up working here, because it would seem that other people have that idea elsewhere and they encourage people to come here.WOLF: Let me flip the conversation around a little bit. You mentioned Vice President Harris. The current governor of California, Gavin Newsom, used to be the mayor of San Francisco. The city has an outsize influence in state and national politics. What is your view of how those two people’s careers will progress?ESKENAZI: I think Kamala Harris will rise or fall based upon factors other than her performance as district attorney in San Francisco quite some time ago.I think that it’s very hard to see some of Gavin Newsom’s moves here in California as other than politically based. Gavin Newsom does not seem to want to give fodder to (Florida Gov.) Ron DeSantis and, as a result, something that we know would work here in California, which is having supervised drug use centers – which have worked elsewhere in the country and worked elsewhere in the world – he vetoed that bill.So we’re left with doing the same thing we’ve always done with regard to drug users and drug addicted people, which is not much – and the death toll is staggering.I have a hard time seeing that as anything other than a politically based move. And he didn’t give Ron DeSantis something to tease him about, and people are dead on the streets. It’s very frustrating for those of us who live here.WOLF: You’ve lived there pretty much your entire life. Has the city gotten better or worse in the last 40 some odd years?ESKENAZI: It’s different. Some things are better, and some things are worse. People who tell you differently are seeing things through blinders, frankly. Full disclosure: You and I went to college together, and I grew up in the area. After Berkeley, I ended up moving full time to San Francisco 20 some odd years ago.When I moved to San Francisco, Zach, there were well over 100 murders a year.We’ve had as few as 41 murders, I think, two years ago (note: it was 2019). We’re on pace to have about 56, 55. So it’s very different. Violent crime is much lower now than it was 20 years ago, 10 years ago.But property crime is off the hook. And overt misery is off the hook. And the budget of San Francisco has ballooned. So people are frustrated.But simply saying things are worse or things are better strikes me as being reductive. Things are certainly more expensive.",politics,0.0
77,82,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/politics/biden-trump-feinstein-age/index.html,"Biden, Trump and Feinstein symbolize a generation loath to cede power",2023-05-03 11:14:00,"Old guard political leaders are defying one of America’s fabled political rites – the passing of a torch to a new generation. And some voters and those keen to assume power are frustrated.The questions of age and the extent to which voters should try to judge politicians’ mental cognition – and whether it should disqualify someone from public office – are boiling up as the 2024 election season gets underway.There’s never been an election like it.Joe Biden, who is the oldest-ever president at 80, just launched a bid for reelection. Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the Republican nominating race, would be 82 by the end of a non-consecutive second term. The advanced age of both men is doing nothing to quell their ambition and their mutual antipathy after 2020’s bitter campaign. But it also poses risks for both parties and has fueled calls that it’s time to move on from a pair born in the 1940s.The specter of octogenarian commanders in chief is not the only age-related political flap. There was fresh speculation on Tuesday about the future of 89-year-old California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose weekslong absence from Washington as she recovers from shingles has jammed up judicial nominations and drained power from the Democratic Senate majority. And Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell recently returned from his own convalescence after suffering a fall soon after turning 81. Only Nancy Pelosi, the longtime House speaker, recently heeded time’s call after stepping down from Democratic leadership.The rising questions about age spring from a number of building political forces – most obviously the longevity and unslaked ambition of some of the nation’s top leaders. Their prominence is all the more relevant in a polarized and narrowly divided government, where even a small shift in power can create wild shifts in the nation’s political direction. Democrats are still traumatized, for instance, by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, which allowed then-President Trump to cement an unassailable conservative Supreme Court majority that may last for years.In a similar way, a major health crisis for Biden or Trump, if he is the Republican nominee, late in the 2024 campaign could cause extraordinary political shockwaves. Many Democrats in Washington admit privately they’re nervous about the possibility. Others worry about the split screen comparison between an aged Biden and a younger GOP nominee if it’s not Trump. And Republicans clearly believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is an electoral liability for Democrats and are stressing that she’s a heartbeat away from the top job.The debate over age also reflects the coarse nature of today’s political discourse, at a moment when the long-time standards of decorum and respect for the presidency and elder statesmen and women have eroded.Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, for instance, implied that it was “not likely” that the president would make it to 86 – the age he would be at the end of a second term. In an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, the former South Carolina governor said that Biden “didn’t even know where he was the week before” and couldn’t specify how many grandchildren he had. (Her claims that Biden is unfit to serve are not backed up by any medical evidence.)Haley, 51, is calling for “competency tests” for presidential candidates and other politicians over age 75 – a threshold that would conveniently include Trump. Her attacks on Biden also seem like a way to get attention for her campaign, which starts at a huge disadvantage against Trump.Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – often viewed as a standard bearer for a new generation of Democrats – on Tuesday hardened calls for Feinstein to resign. The 33-year-old New York congresswoman argued that the senator’s absence meant her party couldn’t push more judges through the Senate at a time when abortion rights are being fought for in the courts.“Her refusal to either retire or show up is causing great harm to the judiciary – precisely where repro rights are getting stripped. That failure means now, in this precious window, Dems can only pass GOP-approved nominees,” Ocasio-Cortez posted on Bluesky, a new social media app.Feinstein’s Democratic colleagues have mostly defended her despite rising frustration over her absence – partly owing to the great respect in which she’s held in the Senate, which is still a more courtly institution than most in US politics.Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse suggested that if she retired, Republican obstruction tactics would prevent Democrats from replacing her on the Judiciary Committee. “The problem only goes away when she comes back and sits in that seat and votes again,” Whitehouse told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Feinstein had asked to be “temporarily” replaced on the panel in April, but Republicans formally blocked such a request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.Some GOP senators have been defending Feinstein staying in office, though her absence while holding on to the seat coincides with the political goal of blocking or slowing the confirmation process for Biden nominees.Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who at age 89 is the second oldest member of the Senate, told CNN on Wednesday that Democrats should leave Feinstein alone after attacking her for years.“They’re picking on somebody that’s older, and it just doesn’t show the proper respect for somebody that has been serving in the Senate for 24 years, maybe 30 years,” said Grassley who was reelected to another six-year term last year. “So let’s just leave it this way. They should leave her alone. She’s sick. She needs to get well so she can get back to work.”It’s not unusual for questions about the health of senators to get attention in Washington considering their prolonged tenures. Segregationist Strom Thurmond was wheeled around the Senate and died at 100 in 2003 – a few months after retiring as a Republican senator from South Carolina. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd was still serving when he died in 2010 at 92. The comparison between the treatment of Feinstein and these two old Senate bulls has led to accusations of sexism. There may be something to this. But pressure on the California senator is worsened by the slim balance of power between the parties. And if she doesn’t return soon, her absence could hamper Democrats not just over judges, but in a debt ceiling showdown with Republicans in the coming weeks.Feinstein, a pioneer female politician, has been fighting a case of shingles in recent weeks, according to her staff. But she has also faced questions about her mental faculties in recent years. Schumer’s notes at his weekly press conference on Tuesday, captured in a photo, suggested that he expected her back in the chamber as soon as next week, though he did not voice that view. A spokesperson for Feinstein said she was making progress but there was no timeline for when her doctors would judge it safe for her to return to Washington.Questions about Biden and age will only get more oppressive in a campaign in which the president will be under pressure to constantly demonstrate energy, sharp wits and that he is up to the huge pressures of his job. While Biden’s physicians have certified that his health shows he is fit to fulfill his duties, the risks of some kind of adverse health event obviously rise with age.Like most presidents, he has clearly aged in office. And his frequent verbal gaffes and moments when he appears to lose his train of thought only play into assaults by Republicans who argue he’s not fit to serve. Biden, however, has had a reputation for putting his foot in his mouth long before he became a senior, back to when he was a loquacious senator from Delaware.The classic argument about old presidents is that these are the people who hold the nuclear codes; they need all their mental faculties. It was made against President Ronald Reagan, who left office at age 77 ahead of a later diagnosis with Alzheimer’s.Concerns about age are not an invention of the media or Republicans. Many Americans are very worried about it. An NBC News poll released last week showed that 70% of Americans didn’t want Biden to run again – and half of those said that age was a “major” reason.Despite this obvious vulnerability, the president stumbled somewhat over a question about his age during a rare press conference last week before assuring Americans he had carefully considered all the implications.“With regard to age, I can’t even say – if I guess how old I am, I can’t even say the number. It doesn’t – it doesn’t register with me,” Biden told reporters. “The only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out – they’re going to see a race, and they’re going to judge whether or not I have it or don’t have it. I respect them taking a hard look at it. I’d take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.”By the weekend, Biden used the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner to try to defuse the age questions by joking about his old friend and founder “Jimmy Madison.” But it’s going to be an issue for him all the way until November 2024, not least because Trump has raised questions about Biden’s mental capacity ever since running against him in 2020.It’s fair to ask, however, why Trump – who turns 77 next month – is not facing similar questions.

Failure to do so could trigger a domestic and international financial catastrophe.Yellen wrote to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that unless Congress acted, it would cause “severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests.” Experts have warned of a potential crisis on the scale of the 2008 financial meltdown, with the threat of benefits not being paid to veterans and senior citizens, and halts to military funding and vital government programs.Her letter swiftly turned what has for weeks been a theoretical threat of a default sometime this summer into a real-time nightmare with a flashing deadline, leaving little time for McCarthy and Biden to find a way to save the economy.McCarthy has accepted an invitation to meet with the president on May 9 about the debt ceiling, according to a source familiar, setting the stage for the high-stakes moment.Biden on Monday invited congressional leaders to the White House next week for talks on the crisis. The political futures of both the Democratic president and Republican speaker may depend on winning the showdown, and it is unclear whether there is room for a compromise that could satisfy each of them.Yellen’s letter may also go some way to sparking alarm on Wall Street about the situation after a period in which investors appeared sanguine that the perennially dysfunctional Congress would likely step back from the precipice at the last minute.The gulf between the parties remains massive. Republicans want Biden to make huge concessions on spending that would fundamentally reshape his legacy. They are using the debt ceiling crisis and the possibility of a financial catastrophe to try to get the spending cuts they hope could define their time in the majority.There is nothing wrong with Republicans using power won in a democratic election to fight for what they say they and their voters want – reductions to what they see as bloated federal spending and efforts to slow the growth of the national debt, which currently stands at more than $31 trillion. But the question they face is whether it is appropriate to use the prospect of fiscal Armageddon to advance a partisan goal.The president is refusing to cave into their demands. He insists Congress must pass a “clean” bill to raise the government’s borrowing limit – a power only Congress has. He says he is willing to discuss spending – but only in the context of the yearly budget – a process the House GOP has barely started.The coming debt crisis represents the most acute moment yet in a period of divided government that will show whether Washington is able to overcome the country’s political estrangement. The most sobering reality is that if the US tumbles off the debt cliff, it will be a self-inflicted disaster that would shatter America’s reputation as a haven of financial stability that is critical in cementing Washington’s global leadership.The debt ceiling needs to be raised because the government takes in less money in revenue than it spends. It is able to borrow money at excellent rates because it has a reputation of always paying its bills. Democrats point out that government borrowing authority needs to be raised since Congress is obligated to pay for spending that it has already approved. They also cite the fact that Republicans had no trouble doing so when former President Donald Trump was in office.With the moment of disaster approaching, the most worrying thing is that each side seems to believe that the prospect of the unthinkable will eventually force the other to blink to avoid being saddled with the blame. But there’s no evidence yet either can or will.“This is not the way to do things, to hold the entire economy hostage to your political agenda,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday. “It’s juvenile. It’s irresponsible. It’s essentially political arson.”But South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” that “the president and the Senate ought to come to the table and work together with Republicans and make some decisions about how we move forward and take on spending and the debt.”McCarthy heads a radical and tiny House majority that is cast in the disruptive image of Trump. A Republican wish-list bill, which raised the debt ceiling for a year in return for measures like expanding work requirements for Medicaid and cuts to climate change spending, squeezed through the House last week by the narrowest margin possible. Even if Biden were willing to negotiate, there’s no guarantee McCarthy could pass any compromise that did not involve the president’s utter capitulation. And if the California Republican tried to pass a less confrontational bill to shield the economy with the support of some Democrats, he could be ousted by his conference.Biden faces equally existential questions. Given that he is dealing with a Republican House that seems bent on an extreme path, he is likely to face calls in the coming days to show that he is the “adult in the room” and to make concessions in order to shield millions of Americans from harm. But in doing so, he’d show weakness that would compromise his presidency and encourage Republicans to wield the nightmare scenario of a debt default again down the road. He may also demoralize Democratic voters he needs to support the reelection bid he launched last week.The administration’s logic is that if hostage takers get concessions, they will demand more.Much will depend on whether Democrats in Congress stand firm behind the president amid growing concern about the political impact of the crisis. It also remains to be seen whether more moderate Republicans critical to the party defending its majority in 2024 begin to demand their own concessions and for McCarthy to stand up to hardliners.And ultimately, given that only Congress – and not the president – has the power to raise the debt ceiling, the fate of the country may rest on whether McCarthy is willing to risk his career and speakership to avert the worst consequences of this game of Russian roulette with the economy. Given that it took him 15 rounds of voting to win the speakership in January, which required multiple concessions to his party’s most extreme members, that seems unlikely.So is there any hope that catastrophe can be avoided?“I will take a bit of positive news out of this – they are talking, at least we have got that part going. For the last several months, they weren’t even doing that,” Jim Bianco, a financial analyst and president of Bianco Research, told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. But Bianco also warned that things are already not going well in an economy that did not need the shock of a debt default.The worry is that the May 9 meeting with Biden and McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will only entrench divides.The White House stressed on Monday that the meeting would focus on the need for a “clean” bill to raise the debt ceiling – signaling no shift toward McCarthy’s position. The speaker reinforced his stand during a trip to Israel that he used to goad the president.“House Republicans did their job and passed a responsible bill that raises the debt ceiling, avoids default, and tackles reckless spending,” he said in a statement on Monday. “Meanwhile, President Biden has refused to do his job — threatening to bumble our nation into its first ever default — and the clock is ticking.”This is the kind of pre-game positioning expected ahead of a tough negotiation and is similar to that which preceded a deal that narrowly averted a debt default in 2011 between then-House Speaker John Boehner and then-President Barack Obama. But even though fiscal disaster was averted that time, the US did lose the top-level credit rating awarded by ratings agency S&P, which raised US borrowing costs for years afterward. More than a decade on, the bitterness between the parties is deeper and the GOP has marched far to the right, making the possibility of a compromise even more questionable. Some members of the GOP House majority – in which McCarthy can only lose four votes and still pass a bill – have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling.In more normal circumstances, it would be possible to see a way out of the situation. In a classic Washington fudge, Biden could agree to curbs on spending in a budget negotiated with Republican leaders in the House that could then get through the Senate. Republican House members could argue that they had beaten Biden as cover for passing a “clean” bill raising the debt ceiling. The president could allow McCarthy that symbolic victory in return for getting new government borrowing authority that would spare the country and the world the impact of a debt default.But such an outcome would require trust between the parties, a functioning relationship between McCarthy and Biden, courageous leadership and a willingness from lawmakers in both parties to cast tough votes that could come back to haunt them in primary races. None of these qualities appear in ready supply in Washington in an age of increasing polarization.The debt ceiling will have to be raised eventually. But it’s growing increasingly hard to see how it could happen without some of the consequences of a default playing out to show both sides the severity of the political costs that subsequent misery could cause Americans.Senate Minority Whip John Thune told reporters that Monday’s developments only underscored the need for Biden and McCarthy to get to work.“Time’s a-wasting,” the South Dakota Republican said.",politics,0.0
79,84,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/politics/bank-debt-crisis-default-what-matters/index.html,It’s time to worry about a US default. For real this time,2023-05-01 18:29:00,"Two converging crises are testing American confidence in their financial well-being.There’s a banking crisis, which regulatory officials and big American banks very much want you to believe is ending after decisive action over the weekend to take over and swallow up another failing bank.And there’s a debt crisis, which is becoming more urgent as the US approaches the “X-date” – when it would default – and on which opposing lawmakers aren’t currently talking to each other.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday the X-date could arrive as soon as June 1. But it has been a moving target.President Joe Biden on Monday called the top four congressional leaders, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, to discuss raising the debt ceiling, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Americans woke up Monday to news that a third US bank, First Republic, had failed. Having catered to wealthy coastal clients, First Republic had been on the edge of collapse since March, when two other regional banks failed.First Republic Bank was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Monday, and most of its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase. The culmination of government regulators and the banking industry came together to protect creditors and maintain confidence in the banking system as a whole without exposing taxpayers to an unpopular bailout.“Nobody is crying over First Republic Bank,” said Christine Romans, CNN’s chief business correspondent, during an appearance on “CNN This Morning.”“But you don’t want chaos and turmoil to spread to the rest of the banking system,” she added, explaining the takeover.The former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, speaking to Bloomberg before the takeover, said it’s important to tamp down troubles in the banking system because they can easily spread.“These things are like forest fires,” said Summers. “It is much easier to prevent them than it is to contain them after they start to spread.”Praising the intervention, Biden tried to reassure Americans that the banking system was “safe and sound” during an appearance in Washington, DC, on Monday.None of that means this is a golden chapter for the American financial system. The failure of three banks this year suggests a hard look at how banks are overseen. And the Federal Reserve has lost some credibility among top economists.“It remains to be seen whether the still-simmering financial turmoil triggered by SVB’s (Silicon Valley Bank) collapse will boil over into a deeper crisis, but investors and depositors have no reason to trust the Fed’s assurances that it will not,” Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor and Nobel laureate, wrote for MarketWatch. “Only meaningful reforms of deposit insurance, governance, regulatory structure and supervision can restore confidence in banks and the Fed’s credibility.”In fact, the FDIC is advocating to raise the amount of deposits insured above the current $250,000 cap. Read more on that developing story.If only American lawmakers could take a cue from the First Republic saga and get into a room to solve the debt crisis.Instead, Republican and Democratic lawmakers are still posturing even though the country is a month or so away from the X-date, when it begins defaulting on its debts.What exactly would happen immediately after the X-date is not entirely clear, but it could lead to a crisis of confidence in the US government, making it more difficult to continue to finance Social Security and Medicare; threaten the value of the dollar, which has been a cornerstone of the world economy; and tip the country into a recession. Read more predictions here.Rather than clearing their calendars to make sure the government can continue to write checks for all the debt it has already accrued, lawmakers are still in their partisan corners.Last week, House Republicans made their opening bid in the negotiations by passing a bill to indiscriminately lop off billions in federal spending, revert to 2022 spending levels, undo anti-climate change spending championed by Democrats and impose new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The bill, which is a nonstarter in the Senate, would also guarantee another debt debate this time next year.This week, rather than hash things out, McCarthy is in Jerusalem, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“The president still hasn’t talked to me,” McCarthy said, making clear he wants to negotiate with Biden.The White House, meanwhile, has argued there should be no negotiation over paying bills for debt sold to cover spending already authorized by Congress.“America is not a deadbeat nation,” Biden said during that event in Washington, using the term associated with parents who fail to pay child support. “We have never ever failed to meet the debt. And as a result, one of the most respected nations of the world, we pay our bills and we should do so without reckless hostage taking from some of the MAGA Republicans in Congress.”I asked Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, what separates the debt crisis from the banking crisis.He told me over the phone he’s not at all worried about the money he has deposited in an American bank, arguing he has complete confidence in the FDIC to cover deposits, as it and banks have done for all three banks that failed this year.He also pointed out the bank failures represent three relatively small institutions by US standards.But he is extremely worried about the US defaulting on its debt.“This generation of bank regulators learned from the mistakes of the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis,” Wolfers said, suggesting they have no qualms about stepping in early to maintain confidence in the financial system.There is no similar confidence in the nation’s politicians to do the same.“There’s a great fear that this generation of legislators are more irresponsible, more polarized and more willing to do damage than any previous generation,” he said.We will, at some point in the very near future, get to the place where Biden and McCarthy, along with other top Democrats and Republicans, must come together to avoid a default or deal with the aftermath of its occurrence. The question is whether the economy is damaged in the meantime.“I will tell you that I am more worried than I’ve ever been in my career, at this moment, about the sky actually falling,” Wolfers said, noting that in previous standoffs over the debt ceiling, Republicans have ultimately stood down in the face of pressure from more moderate wings of the party. It’s not clear that will happen this time.",business,0.0

The run of banking crises has been partly caused by damage to banks – which had profited from years of low interest rates – from the Federal Reserve’s quick rate hikes to fight high inflation.Challenges to the economy are already causing political reverberations for Biden, who launched his reelection bid last week arguing that he had engineered a strong exit from the Covid-19 storm for the economy, notwithstanding high inflation that caused significant pain for American families last year. Inflation has not yet fallen to low levels typical of recent decades, which has fueled an era of price stability.But JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon told reporters on Monday morning that the banking system is “getting near the end” of its problems and that despite the failure of First Republic – which had been widely viewed as in good shape mere weeks ago – the situation was nothing like the 2008-2009 banking and financial crises.“The American banking system is extraordinarily sound,” Dimon said. “Obviously, if going forward, you have recessions and rates going up and stuff like that, you’ll see some other cracks in the system, but that has to be expected. The system is very, very sound.”Yet the pain in the regional banking industry comes amid growing anxiety about a separate challenge to the sector posed by tens of billions of dollars in commercial real estate loans held on buildings whose values have tumbled following a slow return to offices in many cities and a reshaped work culture after the pandemic.A surprisingly resilient economy has resisted an expected tumble into a recession for many months at a time of near historic low levels of unemployment. But the new banking drama will add to worries about the near-term future that were stirred by a slowing of economic growth to an annualized and seasonally adjusted rate of 1.1% in the first quarter of the year, according to official data published last week.The new concerns over the banking sector put the administration back in an unappealing position. During the previous round of banking disruption earlier this spring, administration officials strenuously denied that their interventions – designed to protect depositors rather than industry executives who made rash decisions – amounted to a bailout.This position was a recognition of the political hangover left by massive government-funded rescues of the sector during the 2008 financial crisis, which helped nurture the Tea Party movement in the Republican Party and angered Americans amid a sudden escalation of unemployment.But the charge that the administration is engaging in a 2008-style bailout for wealthy banking executives – even if it is not accurate – is an easy one for Biden’s political opponents to make and is complicated for the White House and the Treasury Department to refute. At the same time, however, the likely political impact of a possible widespread banking crisis had First Republic simply been allowed to fail could have proven even more damaging to Americans generally and to the Biden administration, especially ahead of 2024.Prospects for the economy are also being darkened by the deepening standoff between Biden and congressional Republicans, who are demanding steep spending cuts in return for raising the government’s borrowing authority. If the debt ceiling is not lifted by the summer, the US could default on its obligations, setting off an economic plunge that could cause a recession, create an unemployment crisis, gut America’s reputation as a safe haven for investors and harm the global economy. The president is accusing Republicans of holding the economy hostage to politically motivated demands, and said he will only discuss spending matters in the context of the budget, not in relation to the debt ceiling.Some progressive Democrats have balked at the idea that already mighty banks will get bigger by stepping in to snap up assets of troubled banks. They have also claimed that banking deregulation efforts by the Trump administration made failures more likely.Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna represents a California district that includes part of San Francisco – home to some troubled regional banks that have played an important role in expanding the high-tech sector. On Sunday, he called for a shift in federal government policy to ensure all bank deposits. Currently, the government only insures deposits up to $250,000.“Right now, they may need to work with banks and private capital to save First Republic. I mean, that is the state we’re in. But we can move quickly,” Khanna said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”Khanna argued that the FDIC should pursue the lowest cost option to save First Republic depositors.“We also need reform. I mean, look at what has happened. … Every time the economy heats up, we somehow say, deregulate, deregulate, and it never works out.”The First Republic crisis built last week after shares in the bank plunged from $122.50 on March 1 to around $3 a share as of Friday amid what turned out to be unfounded expectations that the FDIC would step in by end of day and take control of the San Francisco-based bank and its deposits and assets.The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that JPMorgan Chase and PNC Financial were among the big banks bidding on First Republic in a potential deal that would follow an FDIC seizure of the troubled regional bank. There was no immediate comment from the FDIC or those banks.Some of the country’s biggest finance firms, JPMorgan and PNC, had previously attempted to stabilize First Republic with $30 billion in deposits, but the move failed.This story has been updated with additional information.",business,0.0
81,86,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/politics/nationalism-conservatism-what-matters/index.html,‘Nationalism’ redefines the American right,2023-05-06 08:03:00,"The American right wing, long identified with the conservative movement, is increasingly latching onto something very different – nationalism – which frightens some students of history but is inspiring to a new breed of Republicans.Some recent examples:These moments, which seem unremarkable to a regular consumer of news, remind us that the Republican Party has been struggling for decades to reconcile its internal partnership of nationalists and conservatives. If you just woke up to American politics in the past 30 years, the two terms seem synonymous, but they haven’t always been.So what is a nationalist and what is a conservative? And does it matter if we use these terms interchangeably?First, a quick definition: When academics use “nationalism” by itself, it’s the concept that some kind of identity matters more than philosophy. That can be a place, an ethnicity or a religion. In current US politics, we typically see that identity with Christian nationalism or White nationalism.Whether you throw all the way back to the philosopher Edmund Burke or start with former President Ronald Reagan, conservatism has typically meant a resistance to radical change and a faith in caution, especially when it comes to government’s role in a citizen’s life.Many conservatives bristle at being lumped in with the very idea of nationalism, even without add-ons like “Christian” or “White.” Their version of conservatism is irrespective of place.Former Heritage Foundation Executive Vice President Kim Holmes argued in 2019 that “American conservatives have argued that one of the great things about America was that it was different from all other countries. Different from all other nationalisms.”Trump flipped that more open principle of conservatism around when he declared himself to be a “nationalist” in 2018. Most of his policy proposals as president were focused on putting “America First.”For Holmes, American identity is “based on a universal creed … grounded in America’s founding principles.” Holmes sees kindred spirits and a shared struggle with conservatives elsewhere in the world who might share those principles.Conservativism as a concept wasn’t even partisan in the 20th century. Joe Biden embraced the term during his first term in the US Senate, telling Kitty Kelley of the Washingtonian in 1974, “When it comes to civil rights and civil liberties, I’m a liberal but that’s it. I’m really quite conservative on most other issues.”Over time, the term has evolved. As Lee Drutman, a political scientist at the think tank New America and author of “Breaking the Two-Party Doom Loop: The Case for Multiparty Democracy in America,” told me, “Once upon a time, there was a consistent meaning, but now you can be a national security conservative, an economic conservative, a social conservative. It’s become more of an identity.”Holmes said when conservatives lose confidence in the strength of their philosophy, it risks becoming an identity. “They think that traditional fusionist conservatism and the American exceptionalism idea are not strong enough. These ideas are not muscular enough. They want something stronger to stand up to the universal claims of globalism and progressivism that they believe are anti-American.”Such a partnership between nationalism and conservatism, argues Angie Maxwell, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, was forged in the middle of the 20th century when the Republican Party worked to break the hold the Democratic Party had on the South since the Reconstruction to the late 20th century.“We see the Republican Party try to adopt the specific brand of Southern White conservatism,” she said.Maxwell said while the party was divided over the strategy, various Republican campaigns noted they could pick up voters by emphasizing Christian values, anti-feminism and racial resentment. In the 1960s, she noted, sentiments on those three dynamics would split evenly among members of both parties, while today those views are disproportionately felt by Republican voters.Which leads us to today, where Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, says plainly, “We need to be the party of nationalism and I’m a Christian, and I say it proudly, we should be Christian nationalists.”“There’s nothing conservative about Marjorie Taylor Greene, if conservative means we should tread with caution, we should not blow things up, we should have restraint and humility,” argued Drutman, harkening back to Burke, who many consider the founder of modern conservatism. “In some ways, (former President Barack) Obama is much more of a Burkean conservative.”Drutman noted that some forms of nationalism are benign: “You can argue that’s what’s great about America – that we have a diverse and pluralist society, (that) America is the greatest nation in the world because we welcome everyone.”What concerns Drutman is Greene’s kind of identity-driven nationalism.“What is changed in our politics is the extent to which our political divisions have led us to see competing viewpoints as illegitimate. For half the country to treat the other half as if they were a threat to the country,” Drutman said. “Maybe there are some issues where we should be more conservative. They become dangerous when their adherents deny that there is legitimate opposition.”That also concerned Holmes, writing in 2019 before Greene was elected, when he warned, “Nationalism is devoid of a common idea or principle of government except that a people or a nation-state can be almost anything. It can be fascist, it can be authoritarian, it can be totalitarian, or it can be democratic.”",politics,0.0
82,87,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/politics/green-investment-red-states-climate-crisis-fault-lines/index.html,More green investment hasn’t softened red resistance on climate,2023-05-02 00:14:00,"Even as billions of dollars in new clean energy investments surge into Republican leaning communities around the country, state and federal GOP officials are hardening their resistance to efforts to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels.That stark contrast has dashed a central hope and expectation among environmentalists: the belief that more economic opportunity in red places would mean less political opposition from Republicans to the transition toward a clean energy economy that scientists say is necessary to reduce the risk of catastrophic global climate change. The persistence of GOP opposition to that transition underscores the limits of economic incentives to overcome ideological inclinations – and points toward years of pitched partisan conflict that could make it virtually impossible for the US to set a consistent course on climate policy.This dynamic was encapsulated last week when virtually every House Republican voted, in the party’s debt ceiling plan, to repeal the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats passed last year, even though those incentives have already triggered investments in 72 Republican-held districts, including over two dozen districts that have received massive investments of $1 billion or more in new plants or expansions of existing facilities. It’s also apparent in decisions by Republican state attorneys general from states that are among the top beneficiaries of new clean energy investments and jobs to launch a flurry of lawsuits and other legal proceedings against proposals from President Joe Biden’s administration to speed the transition toward a low-carbon economy.This opposition contravenes the traditional assumption that politicians almost always support the economic interests creating opportunity for their constituents. With growing boldness, Republicans and conservative activists are framing defense of fossil fuels and skepticism of clean energy alternatives as a form of culture war – with the transition to wind, solar and electric vehicles taking its place alongside transgender rights, “woke” indoctrination in the classroom or restrictions on gun ownership as an example of “coastal elites” trying to erase traditional American values.In opposing measures to promote clean energy even in places benefiting from new investments to produce it, “Republicans believe – and the next election will help us see whether this is a good strategy or not – that culture war is going to be better to help them win than talking about jobs and the economy,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University.In all these ways, climate change has become another fissure along the central fault line in modern American politics. Like attitudes toward demographic and cultural change, perspectives on shifting the nation’s energy mix from its historic reliance on fossil fuels toward low-carbon alternatives now pit the Democratic “coalition of transformation” that largely embraces the way America is changing on every front against the Republican “coalition of restoration” that resists it.For many Republicans, the Inflation Reduction Act’s sweeping provisions to encourage carbon-free energy sources aren’t “a bipartisan domestic energy agenda,” even though those incentives are channeling substantial jobs and investment to red places, said Robert McNally, a Republican energy consultant and former White House energy adviser for President George W. Bush. “This is a left wing, coastal ‘let’s change the world by having the federal government intervene at a time of high inflation kind of thing.’ When a Republican member does the pros and cons, it’s not like they don’t see the pros, but they see a lot of cons.”Republican-leaning states, as I’ve written, are generally more integrated into the existing fossil fuel economy than blue-leaning places. Trump won 20 of the 21 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector per each dollar of economic activity, mostly states between the coasts that are either big producers of fossil fuels (Wyoming, West Virginia, Texas) or big consumers of it to power robust agricultural and manufacturing sectors (Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana). Biden in turn won 19 of the 21 states with the least emissions, most of them coastal states that produce little oil, gas or coal and have transitioned more rapidly into the post-industrial economy of services and high-tech jobs, such as Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and California. Representation in the House and Senate, and control of state governments, follow these same tracks, with Republicans dominating the high-emitting states and Democrats dominating those with lower emissions. Oil and gas companies now routinely direct about four-fifths of their campaign contributions toward Republicans in Congress.But the energy transition now underway is remaking this picture. Red places are among the clear winners in the emerging clean energy economy. Of the five states that produced the most wind-generated electricity in 2022, according to federal statistics, four are solidly red: Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Kansas; Illinois is the sole exception. Big solar generating states include Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – places where Republicans control the state legislature, the governorship or both.The Inflation Reduction Act that passed last year on a party line vote is further diffusing these opportunities, though no Republican legislators in either the House or the Senate voted for it.Overall, as of March 31, companies have announced “191 new clean energy projects in small towns and bigger cities nationwide totaling $242.81 billion in new investments,” according to a recent report by the environmental advocacy group Climate Power. Those investments are projected to create some 142,000 jobs, the group calculated. Of the 10 states that have received the most announced clean energy projects, the group found, only two are safely Democratic (New York and California.) The rest are either battleground states (Michigan, Arizona and Georgia) or Republican-leaning (Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee).The red tilt on investment is similarly pronounced at the congressional district level. In another study, Climate Power found that over half of all the new clean energy projects announced since the bill’s passage have been located in Republican-held congressional districts. The Republican district projects account, stunningly, for nearly four-fifths of the total clean energy investments that have been announced. The group found that two dozen House Republicans hold seats where clean energy companies have committed to investments of $1 billion or more since the passage of the IRA. The district that has received the most investment is held by New York Republican Rep. Brandon Williams (whose New York seat is the site of a massive plant that will manufacture semiconductors for EVs) and the district projected to receive the most jobs is held by Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei (which has attracted four separate projects). A South Korean company is building a $2.5 billion solar panel manufacturing facility in the Georgia district of far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.Many reasons may explain why so much of the new clean energy investment has flowed into red places. Most important may be that Republican states and districts tilt more toward rural areas where space for large manufacturing facilities is easier to acquire. In those states, taxes are typically lower and state regulations more lenient as well. Some companies are also attracted to the non-union environment in most red states.Whatever the motivation for the companies, environmentalists have hoped that channeling more economic benefits from the energy transition into red places would soften the opposition of Republicans toward deemphasizing fossil fuels. The model some cite is how the spread of defense contracts across virtually every congressional district maximizes support for the Pentagon budget.Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, sees that precedent as critical to sustaining a long-term federal effort behind promoting clean energy. “What we need it to become is the defense authorization act, where every single congressional district has a piece of it – and it can’t be undone and we are set on this path of reaching our goals because of how diffuse it is,” she says.But establishing those political roots, she acknowledges, will take time, and in the near term, the torrent of new investment has not diminished Republican resistance. If anything, as Biden leans into measures to accelerate the energy transition, Republicans are stiffening their opposition.“The harder one side pushes, the harder the other way the other side wants to push back,” said Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a conservative group that supports action on climate change.Last week, almost every House Republican voted for the sweeping bill to raise the debt ceiling that included the repeal of the extensive incentives in the IRA for both producers and consumers to shift to clean energy sources. Earlier this year, every House and Senate Republican, under an act allowing Congress to challenge federal regulations, voted to overturn a Department of Labor rule that would allow pension fund managers to consider so-called ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) goals in making investment decisions – which is considered one important way to encourage more investment in green industries.Biden vetoed that change, but a coalition of Republican state attorneys general are still seeking to block the regulation in court. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 GOP presidential candidate, recently organized a coalition of 19 Republican governors to fight such ESG measures, which he derides as “woke capitalism.”West Virginia’s Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has hinted that when the federal Environmental Protection Agency completes its proposed fuel economy regulations requiring a rapid shift toward electric vehicles, GOP AGs will sue to overturn that, too. No one would be surprised if such a coalition of Republican-controlled states sues as well to block the regulations the Biden EPA is developing to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. (Such a coalition successfully sued to block former President Barack Obama’s regulations on the same topic.) And it seems inevitable that whenever the EPA completes both its fuel economy and power plant regulations that congressional Republicans will attempt to override them as well. From Republicans, predicts McNally, there will be “complete and total opposition on all fronts” to the coming Biden climate regulations. “It will be kitchen sink – everything will be going at it.”Reams is cautiously optimistic that if Republicans obtained unified control of the White House and Congress in 2025, they would preserve at least some of the IRA’s clean energy incentives as part of an “all of the above” strategy to encourage more domestic production of both fossil fuels and low-carbon sources. But McNally, in a view shared from across the political spectrum by Lodes, predicts that if Republicans win unified control, they will “gut” the IRA clean energy incentives that they voted to eliminate last week. “Ninety-eight percent of this is going to go,” he says.When I reached out to several House Republicans last week to ask why they voted to rescind the IRA incentives although their districts have received big clean energy investments, most either did not respond or refused to comment. (In the latter camp was Utah Rep. John Curtis, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus and whose district has received $11 billion in clean energy investments, according to Climate Power.)One who did respond was Amodei, the Nevada Republican. He exemplifies the depth of Republican skepticism to the Democratic agenda to combat climate change. His northern Nevada district contains not only a massive (and expanding) Tesla plant, but also a factory being built by another battery company, Redwood Materials. Between them, the Redwood plant and Tesla expansion are expected to create 4,600 permanent manufacturing jobs as well as many construction jobs, according to news accounts.Yet Amodei voted last week to repeal all the IRA’s incentives to encourage more production and consumption of electric vehicles. In an interview, he said the pace at which Biden and Democrats want to transition transportation toward EVs was unrealistic. “Do I think electricity is the future? Absolutely,” Amodei said. But he added, “even with all these billions of dollars being poured into these things in the form of subsidies and penalties” the rate at which Biden hopes to shift Americans into electric vehicles “borders on suicidal.”Moreover, he asserted that Nevada companies are largely being excluded from the construction jobs generated by the big plant expansions in his district, and that the bigger concern for most constituents he represents is the risk that the IRA’s increased spending will fuel inflation. “The benefits” of the bill, he says, “I don’t think outweigh the negative stuff in terms of debt, inflation and oh, by the way, how much really came to Nevada?”Amodei is one of the Republican members that Climate Power and the League of Conservation Voters have already targeted with ads criticizing their votes. Lodes says his claim that Nevada residents aren’t benefiting from the new jobs in his district “just doesn’t hold water.” She says the group’s challenge is to make clear to voters in the Republican districts benefiting from clean energy investments that their Representatives voted to repeal the incentives encouraging that spending. “The case we will have to make to voters is that every single one of these MAGA extremists put their agenda ahead of their constituents,” she says.That argument could prove effective in some swing districts, particularly those with a large number of college-educated voters. But most House Republicans represent solidly GOP-leaning areas. And demand for action against climate change has remained minimal inside the GOP coalition. Leiserowitz says that in Yale’s polling, only a very small percentage of even moderate Republicans cite climate as an important issue for government to address and that the share of all Republicans who support developing more clean energy sources is actually dropping. Republican voters are far more likely to say they support more domestic drilling for oil and gas. The vast majority of Republican voters even say they will never consider buying an electric vehicle, according to a recent Gallup poll. Democrats mostly take the opposite positions, placing far greater priority on climate change as a problem and expressing much more interest in changing not only public policy but also their personal behavior to combat it.Reams says that disparity has created a striking dynamic, with Republican-leaning communities producing the clean energy favored by Democratic-leaning consumers: “You have a phenomenon of red supply for blue demand,” she says.Like many environmentalists to her left, Reams believes that as the clean energy industries become more “ingrained” in GOP-leaning areas, “more Republicans will say ‘I can’t repeal that.’” The historical behavior of members of Congress says she’s right; but those precedents may no longer apply.Over time, more clean energy investments and jobs in Republican-leaning places should make the case for transition more compelling. Likewise, even in those red areas, more consumers may also experience benefits from renewable power sources or the cost savings of operating electric vehicles. “Clean energy, electric vehicles, all the things associated with these things are going to become part of normal life in America,” says Leiserowitz. The result is that people “will ask, ‘How can you be against something when everybody is doing it?’”But all these traditional dynamics could be offset if clean energy continues to get pulled into the right’s culture war case against “woke” elites. Across a panoramic range of issues – from abortion, LGBTQ rights and guns to classroom censorship and book bans – Republicans, especially in red states, are looking to impose the cultural values of their predominantly conservative electoral coalition against what they consider liberal efforts to uproot the US from its traditions. So long as Republican voters are convinced to see the clean energy transition as part of that threat, even gleaming new factories and fat new paychecks may not much soften the party’s sweeping resistance to climate action.",politics,0.0
83,88,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-counties-2020-election-lies/index.html,"Fact check: Trump, in 2023, tells a new lie about the 2020 election",2023-05-02 10:52:00,"Add another election lie to the long, long list.Former President Donald Trump has tried for nearly two and a half years to convince Americans that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 presidential election he lost fair and square to Joe Biden. He is still trying today, in 2023, as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination once more.But Trump’s latest supposed piece of evidence, like his previous supposed pieces of evidence, is complete bunk.In a speech to a Republican gathering in Florida on Friday, during which he repeated his usual lie that the 2020 election was “rigged and stolen,” Trump pointedly noted that Biden got more votes than Trump in fewer than a fifth of US counties in 2020. Trump then said, “Nothing like this has ever happened before. Usually it’s very equal, or – but the winner always had the most counties.”Facts First: Trump’s claim that the winner of every presidential election before 2020 always carried the most counties is false. The two previous Democratic winners before Biden, Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, carried a minority of counties in each of their victories. Obama won about 28% of counties in his 2008 victory and even fewer, about 22% of counties, in his 2012 victory, according to figures provided to CNN by David Wasserman, a prominent analyst of election data who is a senior editor at The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. Like Biden, Obama won the national popular vote by millions even as he carried fewer than a third of counties.Biden carried about 17% of counties while beating Trump in 2020, a smaller percentage of counties than Obama carried while winning in 2008 and 2012, but there is nothing odd about the 2020 figure. In fact, it’s easy to explain. Land doesn’t vote, people do. In the current political era, Democratic presidential candidates have tended to be dominant in the most populous counties, some of which have hundreds of thousands or even millions of people, while Republicans have tended to do best in areas with fewer residents.“There is nothing suspicious about winning the presidency with a smaller number of counties,” William Frey, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution think tank, said in an email. “Counties vary widely in size, with large urban and suburban counties – areas where Biden did best – housing far larger populations than most of the outer suburb, small town and rural counties that Trump won.”Here’s an example of why winning a county is not inherently significant. Trump handily carried Loving County, Texas, in 2020 – but that county had an estimated mid-2020 population of 65 people. Biden, conversely, handily carried Harris County, Texas, which had an estimated mid-2020 population of 4.7 million people.If you’re counting all county victories as equal, that’s a tie, one county for Trump and one county for Biden. But Biden netted more than 217,000 extra votes from the 1-for-1 trade.The split between vote totals, which determine who wins the election, and the counties-carried tally, which is an inconsequential matter of trivia, could keep getting wider. Said Frey, a well-known demographer: “The residents of Biden-won counties represent faster growing parts of the population – people of color, college graduates, foreign born and single people – than those the that dominate Trump counties. Trump counties will continue to grow more slowly than Biden counties.”Here is what happened in the last five presidential elections won by Democrats; all of these candidates lost a majority of counties while comfortably winning the Electoral College and popular vote. The county figures are all courtesy of Wasserman. He excluded Alaska, which uses a system of boroughs rather than counties.Bill Clinton, 1992: Won 1,524 counties out of 3,112, or about 49%. Won the Electoral College 370 to 168. Won the popular vote by 5.81 million.Bill Clinton, 1996: Again won 1,524 counties out of 3,112, or about 49%. Won the Electoral College 379 to 159. Won the popular vote by 8.20 million.Barack Obama, 2008: Won 875 counties out of 3,113, or about 28%. Won the Electoral College 365 to 173. Won the popular vote by 9.55 million.Barack Obama, 2012: Won 693 counties out of 3,113, or about 22%. Won the Electoral College 332 to 206. Won the popular vote by 4.98 million.Joe Biden, 2020: Won 538 counties out of 3,113, or about 17%. Won the Electoral College 306 to 232. Won the popular vote by 7.06 million.",politics,0.0
84,89,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/29/politics/fact-check-trump-mental-institutions-migrants-doctor/index.html,Fact check: Trump’s own campaign can’t find proof for his ‘mental institutions’ immigration story,"09:35 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","On at least three occasions over the last two months, former President Donald Trump has claimed that the leaders of unnamed South American countries are deliberately emptying their “insane asylums” and “mental institutions” to send the patients to the United States as migrants.In each version of the dramatic story, Trump has claimed he recently read about a doctor at a South American mental institution who said he used to be busy but now has no work to do because all of his patients have been released into the US.In a mid-April speech to the National Rifle Association, Trump said: “I read a story not long ago where a man who takes care of a large segment of people in a mental institution in a South American country, a doctor, sounded like a great man actually – he said he no longer has anything to do. He used to work 24-hour days. He said, ‘All of our patients have been released into the United States of America.’”Trump added more color to the story in a Thursday campaign speech in New Hampshire: “There was a story recently about a psychologist. Or psychiatrist. But a psychologist. Who worked in mental wards in South America. And he said, ‘I worked 24…’ – a good man – he worked 24 hours a day taking care of very mentally ill people. And he was sitting there reading a newspaper and they asked him, what – what’s he doing? He said, ‘I have no more work. The people have all been let go into the United States.’ Can you believe? This is what we’re doing.”But Trump has given listeners no reason to believe him on this.Facts First: Trump’s campaign was unable to provide any evidence of the existence of a news story about a no-longer-busy doctor at a South American mental institution – and the campaign also failed to provide any evidence that South American countries are emptying mental health facilities to somehow send patients into the US. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told us they had not heard of anything that would corroborate any of Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.It is extremely difficult to definitively prove that a news article about an unnamed mental institution in an unnamed country doesn’t exist, so, in the interest of caution, we won’t declare with certainty that Trump’s story is a fabrication – and we will update this article if someone does provide belated proof. At the very least, though, people should treat his story with great skepticism.How we searched for proof of Trump’s storyCNN conducted a broad search for any proof for Trump’s story.First we reached out to Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung to ask for proof. In response, Cheung sent us links to news articles that were not proof. These articles did not mention anything about South American mental health facilities being emptied under President Joe Biden, nor feature any quote from a doctor at any such facility.Cheung did cite a report that late Cuban despot Fidel Castro included mental health patients in the Mariel boatlift of 1980 (they made up a small percentage of the people involved in the boatlift), but that was 43 years ago; Trump’s stories have all been present-tense claims about events purportedly happening during Biden’s presidency. And Cheung highlighted a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about Venezuela supposedly freeing criminals from prison to become migrants. Breitbart’s vague and unverified claim did not mention mental health facilities or doctors at all.We then reached out to a pro-Trump super PAC asking for evidence for Trump’s “mental institution” story, but a spokesperson didn’t respond. We next turned to two groups that advocate for reduced immigration, the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which would be good candidates to be aware of any such evidence. The center’s Mark Krikorian and the federation’s Ira Mehlman also noted the 1980 boatlift from Cuba, but they said they hadn’t seen anything that would corroborate Trump’s claims about the present.Three experts from organizations favorable toward immigration – Migration Policy Institute president Andrew Selee, American Immigration Council policy director Aaron Reichlin-Melnick and Washington Office on Latin America director for defense oversight Adam Isacson – also said they had seen nothing to support Trump’s claims. And our own search of online search engines and a database of news articles did not turn up anything.As a last resort, we posted Trump’s quotes on Twitter and invited the public to try to find support for them.

Gov. Mark Robinson, the current Republican favorite to be the party’s nominee for governor in 2024, has a long history of remarks viciously mocking and attacking teenage survivors of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, for their advocacy for gun control measures.In posts after the shooting, Robinson called the students “spoiled, angry, know it all CHILDREN,” “spoiled little bastards,” and “media prosti-tots.”Robinson, whose political rise as a conservative Internet personality started when a clip of him speaking at a city council meeting in April 2018 went viral, as he was speaking against a proposal to cancel a local gun show after the Parkland shooting. He also began attacking the Parkland survivors after they launched the “March for Our Lives” movement that called for new gun control measures, comparing the students to communists.Robinson’s comments about the school shooting survivors were frequently personal, mocking their appearance and intelligence. In one post on Facebook, Robinson shared a photo of several students posing for photos, with the caption, “the look you get when you let the devil give you a ride on a river of blood to ’15 minutes of Fameville.’”In another comment on Twitter in April of 2018, Robinson shared several crying laughing emojis in response to a post that blasted conservatives who mocked the survivors, writing that when children “got sassy,” adults needed to make sure the “CHILDREN knew their place.”Robinson did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.As Robinson became known for his fierce defense of gun rights, he was frequently featured in videos and promoted by the National Rifle Association. Robinson leveraged his often viral and unapologetic Facebook posts to win his party’s nomination for the state’s lieutenant governorship in 2020, winning the race to become the state’s first Black lieutenant governor.Though the position is largely considered a ceremonial role – and the state has a Democratic governor because the jobs are elected separately – Robinson has now set his sights on the top job. Roy Cooper, the current Democratic governor, is term-limited, and Robinson would likely face Josh Stein, the state’s attorney general, a Democrat finishing out his second term.CNN’s KFile examined his mostly unreported remarks, as the candidate is coming under renewed scrutiny in his bid for the governor’s mansion. Robinson, who frequently posted in defense of law enforcement, often attacked left wing protesters, going so far as defending the shooting of students at Kent State protesting the Vietnam War in May 1970, commonly known as the “Kent State Massacre.”Robinson said such a response deserved to be emulated today.“The shooting that happened at Kent State now, I don’t know how much you know about that shooting at Kent State, but people have got to understand it,” Robinson said on one podcast in 2018. “We have the constitutional right to peacefully assemble. Now peacefully assemble does not mean you could throw bricks at National Guardsmen, bust out windows and block traffic. Once you cross that line into violence and the disruption of public transportation and public services and start blocking the entrances of a federal building, you are no longer a protester.”“You are are now a criminal and you need to be dealt with like a criminal,” he continued. “And we need some politicians in office in some of these cities that’s gonna let people know from the get-go, you go in the street and block traffic, if you block buildings, if you destroy property, you are going to be dealt with swiftly and harshly. We are not going to tolerate it. That is exactly the message that needs to go out to these people. You wanna apply for a permit to protest at the park, that’s fine, but it’s gonna be peaceful and you’re not going to bother anybody, and you’re not going to destroy anything. If you do, you will be dealt with harshly and swiftly.”Though there were violent clashes between local police and protesters in the days leading up to the shooting, the Nixon administration-established President’s Commission on Campus Unrest said that the shooting was unjustified, writing in a 1970 report, “Even if the guardsmen faced danger, it was not a danger that called for lethal force. The 61 shots by 28 guardsmen certainly cannot be justified.”Robinson was also frequently critical of the “March for Our Lives” rally itself, calling it, “a march of pawns in Washington today” and mocked attendees.One photo shared by Robinson mocked an attendee at the “March for Our Lives” rally in Washington, DC, saying the college-aged student needed to “put that sign down and go read a book dummy” and “They live. They breathe. They’ll procreate. #funnybutscary.”His harshest rhetoric was saved for then-18-year-old Parkland activist David Hogg, calling the student a “commie stooge,” in a post that also mocked 18-year-old Parkland student X Gonzáles as “that bald chick,” referring to the pair as “stupid kids.”In another post on Facebook, less than two weeks after the shooting in 2018, Robinson shared the laughing crying emoji with a photoshopped chyron on a picture of Hogg on MSNBC with the title “Media Hogg,” and a day later shared a crude photoshop of the student’s face on body of Boss Hogg from “The Dukes of Hazzard” calling the student “just as corrupt as the TV character.”",politics,0.0

Ron DeSantis for supporting as a former member of Congress and congressional candidate.Trump made the comments in 2000 in a book he authored called “The America We Deserve,” when he was considering a third-party run for president as a member of the Reform Party.Trump, his campaign and a supporting PAC have repeatedly cited votes from DeSantis in Congress for nonbinding budget resolutions that would have raised the retirement age to 70.The campaign has also cited DeSantis’ praise of Paul Ryan’s budget plans during his 2012 congressional campaign with comments that expressed support for privatizing Social Security and Medicare – but a CNN KFile review found Trump himself also once praised Ryan on Medicare, along with the 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, without praising their specific policy proposal, which called for similar changes to Ryan’s plan.In his book, Trump lamented big cuts the program would need without changes, and said he would consider privatization.“The truth is undeniable, the workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme,” Trump wrote. “The solution to the Great Social Security Crisis couldn’t be more obvious: Allow every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds.”“We can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy,” he wrote.The Trump campaign told CNN that that as president, Trump “has consistently showed he would always protect entitlements. In contrast, DeSantis has consistently voted to cut entitlements, and has long advocated raising the age of retirement.”“When President Trump was elected and went to Washington, DC, he saw just how corrupt and dangerous Paul Ryan was and prevented his disastrous ideas like cutting Social Security and Medicare from coming to fruition,” Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesman, said in the statement.In a 1999 interview with NBC News’ Tim Russert prior to the release of the book, Trump said he didn’t want to privatize the program but was open to it.“I don’t like the idea of privatizing Social Security. I think it’s certainly something that could be looked at. I think the Social Security system is in very serious trouble. Obviously, it’s always going to be backed by the country, but I think it’s in very serious trouble. I would look at privatization. I don’t know that that’s the answer.”“But you’d open to it?,” asked Russert .“I’m open to it, yes,” he said.By the 2010s, Trump broke from what was then Republican orthodoxy and said GOP efforts to change entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare would be political disasters and blasted the Ryan budget – urging Romney not to embrace it as the nominee of the party.But in the 2012 presidential race, he defended the Republican ticket – and praised Ryan – saying the pair would save the program. Their plan at the time was similar to the Ryan proposals that Trump has hammered DeSantis for supporting.“I think Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will save Medicare,” Trump said to Fox News in August 2012. I know they will. And people are starting to understand it. They’re going to be very happy with what’s going on, but they’re going to be very, very unhappy if Obama gets in. I think actually if Obama gets in, and if Obamacare isn’t ended, I really think Medicare will be a thing of the past.”In October 2012, Trump again strongly praised Ryan on Medicare in an appearance on Fox News – saying his qualm with Ryan’s budget was he should’ve waited until after the election to make his plans public.“I certainly think it probably would’ve been more appropriate to have waited,” Trump told Sean Hannity. “But I like the energy he brings. I like a lot of the things he’s saying. He’s smart. He truly understands what’s going on with the 17 trillion and the budgets and everything else.“And I think he’s very strongly in favor of – I know for a fact that he’s gonna save Medicare. The other side’s gonna destroy Medicare. He’s going to save Medicare. And as we know it right now – not with big deductions and big cuts and big, he’s going to save Medicare. Medicare cannot exist with the other side in office. It will explode.”As a candidate for the Republican nomination in 2016, Trump reiterated his approach to not touching entitlements, saying his administration would not change either program.A budget from Trump’s White House did eventually call for reducing spending on Medicare, according to the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, but those reductions would largely affect doctors and hospitals. At the same time, in an interview he later walked back, Trump said cuts to entitlements would eventually be on the table.“At some point they will be,” Trump said in January 2020 in an interview with CNBC, comments that made their way into a response ad last week from a super PAC supporting Ron DeSantis in a potential bid for the White House.Asked by CNBC whether he was willing “to do some of the things that you said you wouldn’t do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare,” Trump said: “We’re going to look.”In another interview in 2020, which he again walked back, Trump said he’d be cutting entitlements.When a Fox News host noted that trimming the national debt would require cutting entitlement programs, Trump responded that it would be happening along with economic growth.“Oh, we’ll be cutting, but we’re also going to have growth like you’ve never had before,” Trump said.",politics,0.0

Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in Friday’s ruling.Glossip has maintained his innocence, having been convicted in 1998 of capital murder for ordering the killing of his boss.A review launched by Oklahoma’s Republican attorney general found that prosecutors had failed to disclose evidence to Glossip that they were obligated to produce and that the evidence showed that the prosecutors’ key witness – the supposed accomplice of Glossip’s who committed the murder – had given false testimony.Despite Oklahoma’s assertions that it could no longer stand by Glossip’s conviction, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeal declined Glossip’s request that his execution be halted.In their filings with the US Supreme Court, Glossip’s attorneys argued that – in addition to the obviously irreparable harm he would suffer if the execution moves forward – Oklahoma “will also suffer harm from its Department of Corrections executing a person whom the State has concluded should never have been convicted of murder, let alone sentenced to die, in the first place.”Glossip’s case has been before the Supreme Court before, including in a major challenge the justices heard in 2015 that he and other death row inmates brought to the lethal injection protocol used in executions.In that case, the court’s conservative majority rejected the inmates’ claims that the lineup of the lethal drugs, which had come under scrutiny after several botched executions, violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.Glossip has narrowly avoided being executed on several occasions, including months after the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling, when the execution was called off at the last minute by state officials because of questions about the drugs they were planning to use.This story has been updated with additional details.",politics,0.0

Brian Kemp of Georgia signed legislation Friday that will create an oversight commission with the power to remove local prosecutors and district attorneys from their jobs. The measure has been heavily criticized by Democrats, including an Atlanta-area DA, who is seriously weighing charges in connection with former President Donald Trump’s actions in Georgia during the 2020 election.Prior to the signing, Kemp’s office said that the measure, known as SB 92, would create “an oversight mechanism for district attorneys and solicitors-general across Georgia to ensure accountability in upholding constitution and statutory duties.”“As hardworking law enforcement officers routinely put their lives on the line to investigate, confront, and arrest criminal offenders, I won’t stand idly by as they’re met with resistance from rogue or incompetent prosecutors who refuse to uphold the law,” Kemp said in a press release after signing the bill. He added that the creation of the commission “will help hold prosecutors driven by out-of-touch politics than commitment to their responsibilities accountable and make our communities safer.”The GOP-led state legislature passed the bill earlier this year, mainly along party lines.Democrats have expressed concerns that commissioners could misuse their authority to punish or remove local prosecutors unnecessarily.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who plans to announce this summer whether she’ll bring charges against Trump or his allies for their attempts to overturn Georgia’s 2020 presidential election result, has vocally opposed the the legislation, warning that it would be “dangerous” to undo decisions made by voters.In testimony before the Judiciary Committee of the Georgia Senate earlier this year, she also described the bill as racist and retaliatory.“This bill was never deemed necessary until a historic thing happened in 2020. And let’s just talk about it and tell the truth,” Willis testified, saying that in 2020, Georgia went from having five minority district attorneys to 14. Willis’ office did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on Friday.Republican lawmakers have not specifically targeted Willis in the new legislation.Under the new law, the commission will consist of eight members. Five will sit on an investigative panel tasked with investigating “alleged conduct constituting grounds for discipline” and the other three would be a part of a hearing panel that adjudicates charges and issues “disciplinary and incapacity orders.”The new commission will convene by July 1 and put forth rules and regulations no later than October 1. Under the law, the commission will not be able to receive complaints before October 1 and will not be able to receive complaints about misconduct that happened before that date unless it is related to “a continuous pattern of conduct that continues beyond that date.”",politics,0.0

In letters to his parents and to his friends, Caserta said he was constantly hazed and bullied in the Navy, and he saw no other way out.“It took way too long for something like this to take place,” Teri Caserta told CNN earlier this week. “A bill like this that can save military service members’ lives, we should not have had to fight this hard.”After the Brandon Act was passed into law as part of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, it languished for more than a year as the Defense Department said it was working how best to implement the requirements of the act.“For over a year, I’ve been working with Brandon Caserta’s family to push the Department of Defense to implement the Brandon Act, which will help servicemembers access the mental health support they need,” said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine on Friday. ““The Casertas lost their son under unimaginably horrific circumstances and have turned their grief into an effort to help other servicemembers. I’m glad DOD is finally implementing this important bill to honor Brandon and prevent future tragedies,” Kaine added.",politics,0.0

The Daily Beast has said that Walker did not respond to requests for comment on its reporting.Walker lost his Senate bid to Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock in a December runoff.In a statement, Jon Bennion, a spokeperson for Washington, confirmed that a “certain portion” of the family’s political contributions went to a “non-political account.” Once discovered, he wrote, “the Washingtons immediately requested and received a full refund of such funds.”Bennion said Washington’s team would have no further comment on the matter.In its complaint, CREW argues that soliciting excess campaign contributions – even if later refunded – still amounts to a violation of federal regulations.“The evidence we’ve seen so far raises so many questions about what was really going on here that only an immediate and thorough investigation will suffice,” the group’s president, Noah Bookbinder, said in a statement.Citing agency policy, officials in the FEC press office said Friday they could not confirm whether the commission had received the complaint or otherwise comment on it.",politics,0.0

Remus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The letter included snippets of Chung’s testimony, in which she told the committee that when she packed 13 boxes for Biden in June 2022, the boxes were not put in a locked closet.In an earlier statement, Richard Sauber, special counsel to President Biden said the classified documents “were discovered when the president’s personal attorneys were packing files housed in a locked closet to prepare to vacate office space at the Penn Biden Center,” in November 2022.According to a source familiar with Chung’s testimony, Chung was read Sauber’s statement during her transcribed interview and she said she had no reason to believe that statement was untrue.It is not clear whether those files were part of the documents Chung packed in June or whether Biden’s personal attorneys discovered additional files in November.The White House declined to comment, citing the ongoing special counsel investigation. In January, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to take over the investigation into Obama-era classified documents found at Biden’s home and former private office.CNN previously reported that Chung told the committee she was not aware there were classified documents in the boxes she packed for Biden.Excerpts from Chung’s interview with the committee also reveal that she was surprised that the boxes she packed up at the Penn Biden Center in June 2022 still had not been picked up in October 2022. In excerpts of Chung’s interview released by Democrats on the committee earlier this week, there was no mention of Chung inquiring why the boxes she packed up in June still had not been picked up in October.According to emails Chung shared with the panel that were revealed Friday, a Penn Biden Center employee emailed Chung on October 4, 2022, telling her that the boxes she packed up at the Penn Biden Center on June 28, 2022, still had not been picked up.Chung wrote back, “wait. Did they not pick up back in June,” and told the panel in her interview that she was surprised by this.On October 13, 2022, Chung notified Biden’s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, that the boxes still remained at the Penn Biden Center. Bauer texted Chung back to say that a former personal attorney for Biden, Patrick Moore, was going through the boxes. As CNN has previously reported, Moore made the initial discovery of classified material while packing up Biden’s former think tank office, and has spoken to federal investigators in the initial review of Biden’s handling of classified documents.“So we should get this organized in the near future,” Bauer said in the text to Chung.Chung also acknowledged in her interview that Hunter Biden, the president’s son, had asked if she was interested in serving as assistant to then-Vice President Biden back in 2012. Chung and Hunter Biden had previously worked together.“Hunter Biden called me and asked me if I was interested in the position,” Chung told the committee.Chung’s attorney has previously criticized Comer for how he has characterized Chung’s hiring.“For you to say she got the job ‘to help with the Biden family moving documents at the recommendation of Hunter Biden; and further that you expect to pursue some bizarre notion that Hunter Biden recommended her because of a purported interest in documents indicates to us the real possibility that you do not intend to treat Ms. Chung fairly,” Chung’s lawyer told Comer in a March letter, previously reported by CNN.",politics,0.0

Prosecutors allege the intent was to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information about Trump during the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges last month.In Thursday’s filing, Trump’s attorneys wrote that the former president “denies these were false records.”Trump “will assert that the statements in the purported business records at issue were in fact truthful statements because the money paid to Michael Cohen was, in part, ‘retainer’ or legal payments to Michael Cohen to act as President Trump’s personal attorney.”The district attorney’s office said in a statement, “We are reviewing the notice of removal and will file an appropriate response in court.”The motion from Trump’s legal team has been assigned to district Judge Alvin Hellerstein, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.Trump attorney Todd Blanche told New York Judge Juan Merchan during the tail end of a procedural hearing Thursday that Trump’s legal team would file the motion to move the case, in what appears to be a bid to try to undercut Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case against Trump.Still, the move could add another issue that would need to be litigated ahead of a trial next year.Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, said the move from Trump’s lawyers was unlikely to succeed.“While Trump can seek to remove a state-level criminal charge to federal court, he’d have to establish that the conduct somehow involved his performance of his official duties as president, which seems unlikely given that the hush money payments related to his pre-presidency candidacy,” Honig said.In their argument to move the case, Trump’s attorneys wrote that Cohen was hired as Trump’s personal lawyer to manage Trump’s finances while he was president “in order to separate his business affairs from his public duties.”“President Trump’s decision to retain Michael Cohen to act as his personal lawyer arose out of his duties as President and therefore gives rise to a federal defense to the charges in this case,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.Cohen, who worked for Trump for years and was charged in 2018 with tax crimes, is a key witness for the prosecution.In the filing, Trump’s lawyers also argued that prosecutors are trying to prosecute Trump based on a “novel theory” that Trump committed a felony under New York law by concealing a crime related to a federal election.“There are serious federal preemption issues with such a prosecution,” Trump’s lawyers wrote.Merchan told the district attorney’s office and Trump’s lawyers on Thursday he wanted them to decide on a trial date sometime in either February or March 2024, which would mean that the trial would occur in the midst of the 2024 Republican presidential primary.Once the date is set, Merchan cautioned, the attorneys involved – and Trump himself – could not agree to any engagements that could delay the trial.Thursday’s hearing was the first since Trump appeared in court for his arraignment last month. Merchan tried to iron out disputes between the two sides over a protective order that would limit Trump’s ability to publicize information about evidence from the investigation.Merchan indicated Thursday that he intended to keep in place the bulk of a protective order proposed by the district attorney’s office, saying that limiting Trump’s ability to speak about evidence turned over by prosecutors in the discovery process would not restrict his ability to talk about the case or defend himself as he runs for president in 2024.“This is not a gag order,” Merchan said.Trump’s lawyers objected to language in the protective order limiting what he could say about the case, arguing that his First Amendment rights should not be restricted as he campaigns for president in 2024.The district attorney’s office responded that Trump has a “an extensive history of making inflammatory remarks” about those who are investigating him – including Bragg – and said that Trump would not be restricted from discussing facts already in the public record.Trump’s attorneys also objected to the district attorney’s proposed restrictions that would limit the evidence that could be shared directly with Trump from witness cell phones included in the evidence, such as former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, a key prosecution witness.Merchan went line by line through the language with the lawyers to try to find middle ground on how personal material from cell phones would remain walled off, while evidence relevant to the case could be shared. The judge urged prosecutors and the defense attorneys to hash out compromise language.Once the language for the protective order is finalized, Merchan agreed that Trump, as the defendant, should be told about its contents on the record. The defense attorneys and district attorney’s office agreed that could be done virtually at a future court hearing, in order to avoid the massive police presence that was required in lower Manhattan for Trump’s initial court appearance last month.This story has been updated with additional developments.",politics,0.0
94,99,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/rochelle-walensky-leaving-cdc-director-job/index.html,Walensky leaving post as CDC director,2023-05-05 15:44:00,"Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is leaving her government post, the agency and President Joe Biden announced Friday.Walensky’s last day on the job will be June 30, according to an email sent to CDC employees Friday, which was shared with CNN.In a statement, Biden thanked Walensky for leading “a complex organization on the frontlines of a once-in-a-generation pandemic with honesty and integrity” and wished her well in her next chapter.“Dr. Walensky leaves CDC a stronger institution, better positioned to confront health threats and protect Americans. We have all benefited from her service and dedication to public health, and I wish her the best in her next chapter,” Biden said.Walensky said in a letter to Biden that the agency “saved and improved lives and protected the country and the world from the greatest infectious disease threat we have seen in over 100 years.”“The end of the COVID-19 public health emergency marks a tremendous transition for our country, for public health, and in my tenure as CDC Director,” she wrote. “I took on this role, at your request, with the goal of leaving behind the dark days of the pandemic and moving CDC – and public health – forward into a much better and more trusted place.”Beyond the Covid-19 pandemic, the CDC under Walensky also responded to health crises such as outbreaks of Ebola in Uganda and mpox in nations around the world.“Rochelle Walensky has been an extraordinary leader and a terrific partner,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s Covid-19 response team leader, said Friday on Twitter. “She has done the critical work of launching major reforms to ensure we have an even more effective CDC.”Last year, after acknowledging missteps in its response to Covid-19, the CDC underwent an independent review of those efforts as well as close examinations of its operations. In August, Walensky laid out a sweeping plan to overhaul how the agency works and remake the culture so it can respond more quickly to health problems.“My goal is a new, public health action-oriented culture at CDC that emphasizes accountability, collaboration, communication, and timeliness,” she said in a statement at the time.Part of Walensky’s plan involved asking Congress for new flexibilities in funding and new powers such as mandates that jurisdictions share health data.“Changes are under way on everything from expanding the number of staff who are ready to respond to a disease outbreak to the implementation of plain language trainings to the overhaul of CDC’s website, so that it’s easier for people to find the public health information they need,” Friday’s CDC statement notes.“While at CDC, I had the true gift of meeting, working with, and giving voice to thousands of people at the agency who work 24/7 to worry about health and public health so that the rest of the nation does not have to,” Walensky said in the statement. “I have never been prouder of anything I have done in my professional career.”Before joining the CDC, Walensky was chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The Maryland native was also chair of the National Institutes of Health’s Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council, chair-elect of the HIV Medical Association and an adviser to the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.“Here is the analogy I would make about Dr. Walensky’s tenure at the CDC,” Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN on Friday.“Ed Asner, probably best known for his role on ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show,’ said that when he was a young actor, he had a confrontation on the set of a movie with John Wayne. There was a scene in which Asner was supposed to toss Wayne something to catch. He threw it in a way that Wayne could only look awkward catching it.“I think this is what happened to Dr. Walensky, who is a wonderful clinical researcher and teacher but was thrown a ball in a manner in which she could only look awkward catching it,” Offit said.“Nonetheless, Dr. Walensky did the best she could to explain Covid-19 and Covid-19 vaccines to the public. No one was more empathetic on national television than she was. You could see the pain that we were all suffering during this pandemic on her face. We were lucky to have Dr. Walensky. I’m sorry to see that she will be leaving.”",health,0.0
95,100,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/florida-legislature-ron-desantis/index.html,These are the key bills signed by DeSantis this year,2023-05-05 14:49:00,"Throughout this year’s session, the Republican-controlled Florida legislature has pushed through several pieces of legislation that are considered big policy wins for GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis.As the session came to a close Friday – and as the countdown for DeSantis to jump into the 2024 presidential race begins – here’s a breakdown of the key bills DeSantis has already signed and a look ahead at the measures, ushered through by the legislature’s Republican supermajority, that await his signature.A measure dubbed the Heartbeat Protection Act, signed by DeSantis in a closed-door ceremony last month, prohibits physicians from knowingly performing abortions after six weeks in most cases.Exceptions for rape, incest and human trafficking exist for up to 15 weeks into a pregnancy, but there is a caveat: Women “must provide a copy of a restraining order, police report, medical record, or other court order or documentation providing evidence.” Additionally, after six weeks, two physicians can certify in writing that the abortion is necessary to save the woman’s life or to “avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.”At a March news conference, DeSantis called the proposed exceptions “sensible.”Though enacted, the six-week ban won’t take effect until 30 days after the state Supreme Court either overturns its previous precedent on abortion or tosses out cases from Planned Parenthood and abortion rights activists challenging the existing 15-week abortion ban.In April, DeSantis unceremoniously signed legislation authorizing concealed carry without a permit in Florida.Under the law, which will take effect July 1, gun owners are allowed to carry a gun in public without a government-issued permit.“You don’t need a permission slip from the government to be able to exercise your constitutional rights,” DeSantis said at a March event to promote his new book at a gun store in Georgia.The law also ends an existing state requirement to undergo training before carrying a concealed weapon outside the home.The government-issued permit remains available for those who wish to obtain one. And it would remain illegal to carry a firearm in certain gun-free zones, including schools, courthouses and college campuses.Some gun rights advocates have said that the law doesn’t go far enough, while Florida Democrats have criticized DeSantis for signing the public safety bill, arguing that it achieves the opposite.DeSantis in April signed a bill that eliminated unanimous jury decisions for the death penalty, making Florida the state with the lowest threshold for administering capital punishment.Under the new law, “if at least eight jurors determine that the defendant should be sentenced to death, the jury’s recommendation to the court must be a sentence of death.”If fewer than eight jurors recommend the death penalty, the law requires the court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.”In January, DeSantis vowed to rid Florida of unanimous 12-member jury decisions for the death penalty, citing the verdict in the Parkland school shooting as a miscarriage of justice. The shooter was sentenced to life in prison without parole rather than death, due to three jurors recommending against the death penalty.“Today’s change in Florida law will hopefully save other families from the injustices we have suffered,” said Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was killed in the Parkland shooting.On Monday, DeSantis signed a bill that makes child rapists eligible for the death penalty with the minimum sentence of life in prison without parole.According to the measure, “a person 18 years of age or older who commits sexual battery upon, or in an attempt to commit sexual battery injures the sexual organs of, a person less than 12 years of age commits a capital felony.”“We’re putting pedophiles to death, hopefully,” DeSantis said, before sitting down to sign the bill in Titusville, Florida.The law runs afoul of a 2008 US Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from applying the death penalty for child rape if the victim did not die.“We think that in the worst of the worst cases, the only appropriate punishment is the ultimate punishment, and so this bill sets up a procedure to be able to challenge that precedent,” DeSantis said Monday.DeSantis signed a bill Tuesday that expands upon measures to block Florida investments based on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors while threatening banks and other financial institutions with sanctions if they deny business to people due to moral or political objections.“ESG is officially DOA in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said as he signed the bill in Jacksonville.The new law codifies a measure approved last year by the State Board of Administration, which oversees pensions, that prohibits state retirement fund managers from making investment decisions based on reasons other than maximizing the highest rate of return.“It takes what we did last year with Florida’s Pension Fund, and it codifies into law the idea that the fiduciary obligation is to produce the best returns possible for the beneficiaries, not to be diverted in that task by pursuing these ideological agendas,” DeSantis said.Under the law, financial institutions, including banks, credit unions and other lenders, face fines if they refuse to lend to people for reasons other than “an analysis of risk factors unique to each current or prospective customer.” Under the law, banks that operate in Florida could face punishment if they refuse to lend to gun manufacturers, fossil fuel companies or certain far-right groups.More bills await DeSantis’ signature.Disney will be subject to new measures heading to the governor’s desk, as tensions have escalated in recent weeks with dueling lawsuits between the entertainment giant and DeSantis’ handpicked board to oversee Disney’s special taxing district.Under one measure, the state would take over safety inspections in “any governmentally or privately owned fixed-guideway transportation systems operating in this state which are located within an independent special district created by local act which have boundaries within two contiguous counties.”This would apply to just one transportation system in the state: Disney World’s monorail, which crosses over Orange and Osceola counties.Lawmakers also gave final approval on Thursday to a bill that would allow an appointed board to review and void previous land agreements in the state – a win for the governor in his feud with Disney. DeSantis signed the bill Friday afternoon, after the legislative session ended.Ahead of a state takeover of Disney’s special taxing district, the company reached an agreement with an outgoing board to shift much of the power in the district to Disney. DeSantis and his appointees on the new board have sought to nullify those agreements. This is another tool to potentially void the agreements.Another measure would expand Florida’s ban on instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity from prekindergarten through grade 8, rather than kindergarten through grade 3. The state’s education board voted last month to ban teaching students about sexual orientation and gender identity through high school.Last year’s Parental Rights in Education Act, which opponents have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law, contained the original ban and is at the crux of the ongoing battle between DeSantis and Disney. Additionally, the new measure would prevent teachers and staff at public schools from using their preferred pronouns when talking to students.Also awaiting DeSantis’ signature is a sweeping 96-page elections package, which includes a provision that would allow the governor to run for president without resigning, as he prepares for an expected White House bid.The elections bill would also have larger implications by placing new restrictions on Florida voters and third-party registration groups.Other legislation awaiting DeSantis’ signature would change the lives of transgender people in Florida.The bills would prohibit transgender children from receiving gender-affirming treatments and ban transgender people from using a bathroom in a government building that does not match their biological sex.This story has been updated with additional developments.",politics,0.0

Of course, I’m sure there’ll be conversations about the length. You saw the length in the congressional Republicans’ bill that would take us into this situation again this time next year,” Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young told reporters Thursday at the White House.“I’m sure one of the things on the table we will have to work through is how long? I’m not going to take anything off the table. The important thing to do is to make sure we do this and leave the drama behind regardless of what length we end up in,” she added.Asked whether President Joe Biden would sign a bill that would raise the debt limit for a shorter period of time, Young indicated it would be a positive sign for the negotiations, but said they are not there yet.“At least that part of the conversation about length – I would love to be in that part of the conversation. Because we’re at least in the positive: default is off the table. So I’m happy when we get to that part of the conversation. We’re not there yet. And the idea is to put brinksmanship to bed and get to talking on making sure we avoid default. And once we’re talking about timeframe, that means we’re at least on the right side of this debate,” she said.Young’s comments come ahead of a high-stakes meeting with congressional leaders at the White House set for Tuesday. Republicans have repeatedly advocated for spending cuts tied to the debt ceiling while the White House has emphatically maintained it will not negotiate on the matter.The White House later sought to clarify Young’s comments, telling CNN that she was not explicitly making an endorsement of a short-term increase.A White House official said Friday that Young “wasn’t endorsing a short-term increase, she was making clear we welcome a conversation about how long to increase the debt ceiling instead of whether to increase it.”And later Friday, the official offered a statement more strongly walking back any openness to a short-term fix: “We are not weighing a short-term extension. We are focused on removing the threat of default which will erase our economic progress,” a White House official told CNN nearly 24 hours after Young appeared in the briefing room.Pressed on whether the president could invoke the 14th Amendment, which gives a president an unprecedentedly expansive view of executive power with regard to raising the debt ceiling, she reiterated: “It is Congress’ duty to ensure we don’t default.”Asked once more, she said: “We continue to have the position that this is Congress’ duty to do.”Young warned against a default, which she said is both “catastrophic” for the economy but would also “(set) us on a road to be ineffective in the appropriations process.”The White House has warned against dire and devastating effects the economy should the US default, including the possibility of an “immediate, sharp recession” and the loss of up to 8 million jobs.“Of course we’re concerned. We’re calling on the reasonable people in this town to do the right thing,” Young said Thursday.She continued, “Congress can put a bill on the floor tomorrow, avoid default. The DC drama, the political brinksmanship. That’s what that is. Nothing is preventing Congress from moving to avoid default. And they need to do that, whether it’s tomorrow or next week.”This story has been updated with additional developments.",politics,0.0

Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chief of the Air Force, as his choice for the next top US general, according to a source familiar with the matter.If approved by the Senate, it would mark the first time in United States history that the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs are both African American, a notable milestone for an administration that has prided itself on the diversity of its leadership.Brown would succeed Gen. Mark Milley, who was nominated by former President Donald Trump in 2018. He would be only the second Black man to become chairman, after Gen. Colin Powell served in the position between 1989 and 1993 under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.The announcement is expected sometime before July, according to a second US official, though the exact timing is not clear.Politico first reported the expected pick.The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serves a four-year term. Though the chairman is the top-ranking officer in the military, the position does not command any troops, instead serving as the top military advisor to the president.Milley will see his term expire at the end of September. Biden referenced Milley’s departure during remarks to the Combatant Commanders’ White House dinner Wednesday evening.“You probably don’t think about it, but you’re just remarkable, remarkable, remarkable group of people, I mean that sincerely – except for Milley, I’m not so sure,” he joked, relaying the conversation to the senior officers. “Actually, I don’t want to – I’ve embarrassed him. I said, ‘You know, I’m going to really miss you.’ He said, ‘I’m not going anywhere yet. Don’t get sentimental on me, Biden. I’m from Boston.’”Brown commissioned into the Air Force in 1984 after graduating from Texas Tech University’s ROTC program. An F-16 fighter pilot with more than 3,000 hours of flying experience, Brown has served as the deputy commander of US Central Command and the commander of Pacific Air Forces among his other assignments.

99,104,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/politics/sonia-sotomayor-neil-gorsuch-book-recusal-supreme-court-cases/index.html,2 Supreme Court justices did not recuse themselves in cases involving their book publisher,2023-05-05 13:01:00,"Two Supreme Court justices did not recuse themselves from cases that came before the court over the past decade involving a publishing company that’s paid them in lucrative book deals.In two separate copyright infringement cases concerning the publishing conglomerate Penguin Random House, the high court declined to take up the appeals, with the court saying in 2013 that it wouldn’t hear the first case, and the second case being turned away from the court in 2019 and again in 2020. In both cases, the publisher won at the lower court level, and those decisions stood.Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who joined the court in 2009 and has been paid millions of dollars from the publisher over the years, declined to recuse herself in all three instances.Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court in 2017 and also has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in book deals with the publisher, declined to disqualify himself from the more recent case when it came before the court for consideration.The justices’ actions were earlier reported by Fix the Court, a watchdog group that presses for more transparency from the judiciary, and The Daily Wire.The Supreme Court has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following a series of reports on ethical lapses among some justices related to a lack of transparency around their financial disclosures. Watchdog groups have been especially focused on the court’s recusal practices, an area they say is ripe for reform given that no mechanism exists for ensuring a justice won’t participate in a case in which they might have a conflict.The Supreme Court did not respond for comment.The court does not typically say publicly how a justice voted in a decision over whether to take up an appeal, but it does briefly note when a recusal has occurred.In both cases, former liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who also has received book royalties from the publisher, recused himself.Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, told CNN that the federal law concerning recusal has long been interpreted as applying to stock ownership on the part of the justice or a close family member.Roth said that Breyer, who retired in 2022, likely recused himself from the cases because he owns stock in a company that for a time had a large stake in Penguin.For her part, Sotomayor, who is currently the court’s senior liberal, has published several books since joining the bench, including a few children’s books and a memoir, “My Beloved World,” which was published in 2013 by Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. The group is part of the publishing conglomerate Penguin Random House.In financial disclosure forms for 2010 and 2012, Sotomayor reported receiving book advances from Knopf Doubleday that totaled $3.1 million. Her disclosure forms for the years 2017 through 2021 show that the company has paid her nearly $500,000 in book royalties and advances during that period. The disclosures for 2022 are not yet available.Gorsuch published “A Republic, If You Can Keep It” in 2019 through Penguin. The justice has received a total of $655,000 from the publishing conglomerate in recent years, according to his 2018, 2019 and 2020 disclosures.Roth, whose group has for years kept track of instances in which justices should have recused themselves from a case, said he could not point to other examples where a justice should have disqualified him or herself from a case concerning their book publisher.Roth noted that Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson also have books in the works.“I think these entities should be added to the justices’ recusal sheets, and they should not participate in petitions involving their book publishers that are very clearly enriching them,” Roth said.When it comes to recusals, the standards for recusal at the high court are necessarily more restrictive because the Supreme Court allows only its own members to hear a dispute – unlike the lower courts that can freely substitute one district or circuit court judge for another.In a statement last month by all nine current members of the court that they said was meant to provide “clarity” to the public their ethics practices, the justices explained why individual jurists “rather than the Court” must decide recusal issues.“If the full Court or any subset of the Court were to review the recusal decisions of individual Justices, it would create an undesirable situation in which the Court could affect the outcome of a case by selecting who among its Members may participate,” they said in the statement.",politics,0.0

Madison Cawthorn pleaded guilty Friday to bringing a loaded handgun through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport last year, according to his attorney.Cawthorn, whose trial was set to start Friday, entered a guilty plea for the third-degree misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon on city property, according to his attorney Missy Owen.The former Republican congressman was fined $250, without probation, and his firearm will be returned, his attorney said.“Mr. Cawthorn accepted responsibility for this mistake. Law enforcement noted his cooperative attitude at every step. He chose to resolve this case in a manner that would ensure his uninterrupted right to possess a firearm.  He remains staunchly committed to responsible gun ownership,” Owen added.The incident in April 2022 was the second time in just over a year that airport authorities had stopped Cawthorn with a gun. In February 2021, agents at the Asheville Regional Airport found an unloaded gun and a loaded magazine in Cawthorn’s carry-on bag, according to reporting from the Asheville Citizen-Times. Cawthorn’s weapon was “secured at the airport and he retrieved it after his flight,” the newspaper reported, citing the airport spokesperson. In July 2021, when the story was published, a Cawthorn spokesperson told the Citizen-Times that the congressman had brought the gun “by mistake.” He was not charged in the incident.Cawthorn was first elected to Congress in 2020 as a strong ally of President Donald Trump. But the firebrand lawmaker angered and annoyed a wide swath of his Republican colleagues with a steady stream of controversial antics and remarks. He claimed on a podcast that he had been invited to an orgy in Washington and had personally seen leaders in the efforts to curb drug addiction doing cocaine.Cawthorn ultimately came up short in his bid for a second term. Despite having Trump’s endorsement, he lost in the Republican primary to Chuck Edwards, who had the backing of several top North Carolina Republicans. Edwards easily went on to win the general election for the western North Carolina seat.This story has been updated with additional details.",politics,0.0

Jurors were deadlocked and the court declared a mistrial for the other 18 counts – which included charges of wire fraud and conspiracy – against him and co-defendant Sharon Lettman-Hicks.Gillum, a once-rising Democratic star who nearly won a 2018 race for Florida governor, was indicted last year on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and making false statements.“They’ve quite literally tried to take everything from us. And the beauty is, is that in our system, the powers at be don’t always get to decide. Everyday people like you and me sometimes get our swing at the at the ball,” Gillum said following the jury’s decision.“(A)s far as I’m concerned, they realized 2 through 19 is bogus. Now hopefully we can get our lives back, when the government decides to stop wasting its money, our money, our tax dollars, all of your tax dollars,” Lettman-Hicks said.According to CNN affiliate WCTV, the jury reached the verdict on the charge of lying to the FBI after deliberating for  five days and more than 30 hours.A 26-page grand jury indictment that was unsealed last year alleged Gillum and longtime associate, Lettman-Hicks, engaged in a yearslong scheme to turn political donations and grant funds into personal income. According to a Department of Justice news release, the two obtained funds through “false and fraudulent promises and representations that the funds would be used for a legitimate purpose.”Gillum was also accused of lying to the FBI during an investigation into corruption inside Tallahassee City Hall, where he served as mayor, and was accused of promising political favors to those who financially supported him.",politics,0.0
102,107,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/biden-enthusiasm-michigan-voters/index.html,Can Trump exhaustion lead to Biden enthusiasm? One Michigan county will provide a test,2023-05-05 07:00:00,"President Joe Biden delivers a standard two-word answer whenever he is asked about his fitness to serve a second term, smiling as he declares with an air of boastful confidence: “Watch me.”That’s exactly what Kathi Harris is doing. So far, she is unbothered by it all.“Age is just a number,” said Harris, a loyal Democrat and longtime civic leader here in western Michigan. “Until God takes him home, he has the strength right now to do what he needs to be doing for the country.”Yet that does not mean she is particularly enthusiastic about the road ahead or doesn’t wish voters would be given choices beyond Biden, 80, and a potential rematch with former President Donald Trump, 76.“Do I get excited? No!” she said. “I just think of, again, all that craziness.”A week after declaring his bid for reelection, a wave of new Biden campaign ads touting his accomplishments are already airing in Michigan as the president works to elevate his standing among Democrats and independents who backed him four years ago.Khara DeWit, a small businesswoman who opened South East Market two years ago to bring fresh groceries to an underserved Grand Rapids neighborhood, exhaled when asked about the next presidential race and whether she intended to cast her vote once again for Biden.“I personally only voted for him as a way to debunk Trump,” said DeWit, who fondly recalls seeing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her preferred candidate, on a visit here before the Michigan primary in 2020. “But I really thought our democracy was in jeopardy and I wanted someone else.”For more than two years, she has watched Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and is not displeased with their record or governing style.Of the president, she said: “He is about getting the job done.” Of the vice president: “I was really pleased she was elected. She needs more of a platform.”A tone of respectful reluctance toward Biden comes alive in interviews with many voters here, but DeWit and others expressing some points of skepticism said they had little hesitation at the notion of supporting the ticket again.Asked whether she would be motivated to cast a ballot for Biden or one against Trump, should he become the Republican nominee, DeWit didn’t hesitate, saying: “Trump is the motivator. How do we make sure he doesn’t get elected?”Even as the Republican primary race is still taking shape, Trump dominates the political conversation – among Democrats and Republicans – in Grand Rapids and surrounding Kent County, which he lost in 2020 after winning four years earlier. Once again, this western swath of the state will be among the most competitive pieces of terrain in battleground Michigan.Terry Almquist, a retired professor, said he understands myriad questions about health, stamina and age that are an undercurrent to the doubts a majority of Americans have about the president running again.If elected, Biden would be 82 when taking the oath of office and 86 by the end of his term, setting new records for an American leader.“It will be an issue to a lot of people. I don’t think it should be, but I think it will be,” Almquist said. “But what can I say, I’m 80 years old myself, so he’s one of my people.”A tepid sense of excitement for Biden is palpable in conversations with many people who supported him, like Sarah Laman, who opened Last Mile Coffee in Grand Rapids during the pandemic. She said she has mixed feelings toward the Biden administration as she tries to keep her business on track during high inflation.“Just because somebody has my vote,” Laman said, “doesn’t necessarily mean I’m a massive advocate of them.”Asked whether she intended to vote for Biden again, she paused for a moment and finally said: “I don’t know. I don’t know.”She lamented the limited choices for voters and wondered aloud if a third-party candidate could find an enthusiastic reception or simply be a spoiler, saying: “I have not voted third-party in a presidential election before, but maybe I would be inspired to.”At this early stage of the presidential race, her sentiment helps frame pivotal questions of the 2024 campaign: Can Trump exhaustion lead to Biden enthusiasm? Could that enthusiasm be fleeting if the president faces a new opponent – or two – next year?Nancy Wagner, a retiree and political independent, said she voted for Trump in 2020. But she recoils at the thought of a rematch with Biden.“I think it sounds awful,” Wagner said, stopping to chat after attending a town meeting with her congresswoman, Hillary Scholten, on Tuesday evening. “We need a new generation of leaders. We need people with fresh ideas.”Wagner addresses a quiet concern among some Democrats, too, that Biden may be well-positioned to confront Trump, but may not be the right man for the job if the Republican nominee is someone else who can mount a generational argument for change.Scholten, who last fall became the first Democrat to represent western Michigan in three decades, believes her party must better explain its accomplishments. From the landmark infrastructure law to the investments made to create jobs in the Inflation Reduction Act, Scholten said her constituents aren’t always aware of the Biden administration achievements.“I look at the approval ratings. We all know there is still some dissatisfaction with national Democrats, despite everything they have delivered on in the last two years,” Scholten told CNN. “It’s not an everyday reality for people just yet. These large major improvements are going to take time to come through.”That sentiment underscores a central challenge facing the White House: touting the administration’s record without assuming that all Americans can feel or appreciate the benefits.Driving across Grand Rapids, signs of those accomplishments come into sharper view, like major road construction projects along Eastern Avenue or Interstate 96 or the major expansion of a terminal at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport.“I think the president is not getting the credit for what he has done. We need so much more in the way of infrastructure,” said Almquist, the retired professor. “We’re just scratching the surface.”Almquist said he voted for Biden without hesitation last time, but acknowledges he wasn’t sure how the longtime senator and former vice president would fare in the Oval Office. After watching the president for more than two years, he now believes those doubts were misplaced.“I knew he was a competent person, but I didn’t know how he would present himself on the main stage,” Almquist said. “I must admit, I was wrong. I think he’s handled the whole situation very well.”",politics,0.0
103,108,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/montana-abortion-restrictions-greg-gianforte/index.html,Montana governor signs slate of bills restricting abortion rights,2023-05-05 05:40:00,"Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed on Wednesday a collection of bills restricting access to abortion, triggering legal action and challenging a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling on the procedure.While abortion remains legal in Montana, the legislation specifies that access to the procedure until viability is no longer protected under the right of privacy in the state’s constitution – contradicting the court’s two decades old ruling.“For years in Montana, abortion activists have used the cloak of a shaky legal interpretation to advance their pro-abortion agenda. That stops today,” Gianforte said in a statement Wednesday, describing the new laws as “giving a voice to the voiceless.”The restrictions come as states navigate a new abortion landscape in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, which removed federal abortion protections. Several Republican-led states have enacted restrictions, while some Democratic-led states have passed legislation expanding access to their residents and those seeking care from other states.One of the new laws Gianforte signed Wednesday establishes a “right of conscience” that allows health care providers or institutions to refuse to perform abortions if it violates their “ethical, moral, or religious beliefs or principles.”Another bill, HB625, signed by Gianforte Wednesday, requires health care providers, in the rare case a baby is born alive after an attempted abortion, to give care to the infant or face fines and imprisonment. However, it is already considered homicide in the US to intentionally kill an infant that is born alive.While Gianforte said that the slate of “pro-family, pro-child, pro-life bills will make a lasting difference in Montana,” Democrats and abortion rights advocates argue that the new laws add “unnecessary” provisions to restrict access.Abortion rights advocates secured a preliminary victory Thursday, with a Montana judge temporarily blocking one measure, HB575, that would require a patient to have an ultrasound and get a written determination of viability from a provider in order to get an abortion.The state’s Planned Parenthood chapter had filed an emergency relief request Wednesday after the provision took effect, arguing that requiring an ultrasound before a procedure effectively bans telehealth medication abortion. Such procedures have surged since the Supreme Court’s ruling on abortion last summer.“Instead of trusting us to make our own decisions about our bodies and lives, Montana lawmakers are once again forcing their way into our exam rooms and blocking our access to essential health care,” said Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana.“By adding unnecessary and burdensome red tape to a safe and legal medical procedure, these politicians have made clear that it was never about our health and safety,” Fuller said in a statement Wednesday. “It was always about undermining our personal freedom and shaming people who seek abortions.”This move is one of several legal battles related to reproductive rights playing out in state and federal courts. Near-total abortion bans in Indiana and Ohio remain in limbo after judges issued orders halting the restrictions.",politics,0.0

The bill must then be sent back through committees to be reconsidered before being heard on the Senate and House floors.”In response, Democratic Majority Leader Kate Lieber on Wednesday called on the absent senators to “do your job,” and referenced a constitutional amendment passed in November that disqualifies legislators from reelection at the end of their term if they have 10 unexcused floor absences.“It is no coincidence that Republicans are employing these embarrassing antics as the Senate is about to vote on bills that protect reproductive health freedom and establish common sense gun safety laws,” Lieber said in a statement.“Voters were clear last year when they passed Measure 113 by an overwhelming margin and in every state senate district: elected lawmakers should be in the Capitol doing their jobs.”",politics,0.0
105,110,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/20/politics/donald-trump-legal-clouds/index.html,Notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023,2023-05-04 22:35:00,"It’s been nearly eight years since he rode down the escalator in Trump Tower and more than two years since the January 6, 2021, insurrection, but the legal drama surrounding Donald Trump has never been more intense.In New York, a hush money payment to an adult film star has resulted in his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury over his alleged role in the scheme – the first time in American history that a current or former president faces criminal charges.The civil battery and defamation trial for columnist E. Jean Carroll against Trump is ongoing.In Atlanta, a select grand jury has investigated the efforts by Trump and allies to overturn his election loss in Georgia in 2020.In Washington, a Justice Department special counsel is looking at the 2020 election aftermath and the removal of presidential documents to Florida.Trump and his company deny any wrongdoing or criminality in all matters, state and federal, and he has aggressively maintained his innocence.Here’s an updated list of notable investigations, lawsuits and controversies:Trump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.The former president surrendered and was placed under arrest April 4, before he was arraigned in a historic and unprecedented court appearance, at which he pleaded not guilty.Prosecutors, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.The indictment has sent shockwaves across the country, pushing the American political system – which has never seen one of its ex-leaders confronted with criminal charges, let alone while running again for president – into uncharted waters.The $130,000 payment was paid by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to Daniels to remain quiet about an alleged affair between Daniels and Trump years earlier.Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels and says the probe by Bragg, a Democrat, is politically motivated.Trump is now seeking to move the case to federal court.Special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing the Justice Department’s criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and into parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.The Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were taken to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury has interviewed potential witnesses regarding how Trump handled the documents.RELATED: The big numbers from the Mar-a-Lago searchThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.Any unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.Smith’s purview also includes the period after Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden and leading up to the insurrection at the US Capitol.As part of its investigation, the special counsel’s office has sought testimony from a number of key White House insiders, including former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.Aspects of the Justice Department’s probe include the use of so-called fake electors from states that Trump falsely claimed he had won, such as Georgia and Arizona.Trump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying about certain conversations, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators.Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis oversaw a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia.Willis, a Democrat, is considering bringing conspiracy and racketeering charges, CNN’s Don Lemon has reported.The probe was launched in 2021 following Trump’s call that January with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.The grand jury issued a report – which remains mostly under seal – that found there was no widespread voter fraud in the state and also suggested perjury charges be considered against some people who testified.Overall, the grand jury recommended charges against more than a dozen people, the foreperson said in interviews in February.The House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack uncovered dramatic evidence of Trump’s actions before and on January 6, especially efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election.It issued an 845-page report – based on 1,000-plus interviews and documents collected, including emails, texts and phone records – that alleges Trump “oversaw” the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost. Evidence shows, the report said, that Trump actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives.”In a symbolic move, the committee referred Trump to the Justice Department on at least four criminal charges before it concluded at the end of 2022, ahead of Republicans taking control of the House.Trump’s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted in December by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.Manhattan prosecutors told a jury the case is about “greed and cheating,” laying out an alleged 15-year scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks like luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme. He was released after serving four months in jail at Rikers Island.New York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.James alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.James is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds.Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has called the investigation politically motivated based on the electoral ambitions of James, a Democrat.A trial is set for October 2023.Former magazine writer E. Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and defamed her when he denied the rape, said she was not his “type” and alleged she had made the claim to boost sales of her book.Trump denies all claims brought against him by Carroll.Trump and the Justice Department said he was a federal employee and that his statements denying Carroll’s allegations were made in response to reporters’ questions while he was at the White House. They argue that the Justice Department should be substituted as the defendant, which, because the government cannot be sued for defamation, would end the lawsuit.A Washington, DC, appeals court is reviewing if Trump was acting within the scope of his employment when he made the allegedly defamatory statements.Carroll also sued Trump last year for battery and defamation. That trial will begin Tuesday.Several members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the 2021 riot.The various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating Washington laws that prohibit incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.Trump and his top advisers have not been charged with any crimes. The former president and others who have been sued have argued they are not responsible for the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol.A federal appeals court is considering Trump’s attempt to throw out the cases.Former top FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who was fired by the FBI in 2018 after the revelation of anti-Trump texts he had exchanged with a top lawyer at the bureau, Lisa Page, has sued the Justice Department alleging he was terminated improperly.Strzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies as part of the larger ire Trump expressed toward the FBI during the Trump-Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok’s ouster until he was fired in August 2018.A federal judge ruled that Trump and FBI Director Christopher Wray can be deposed for two hours each as part of the lawsuit.A federal judge in September dismissed Trump’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, several ex-FBI officials and more than two dozen other people and entities that he claims conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign by trying to vilify him with fabricated information tying him to Russia.“What (Trump’s lawsuit) lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,” US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks wrote.Trump is appealing the decision, but Middlebrooks also ruled that the former president and his attorneys are liable for nearly $1 million in sanctions for bringing the case in the first place.“No reasonable lawyer would have filed it,” Middlebrooks wrote. “Intended for a political purpose, none of the counts of the amended complaint stated a cognizable legal claim.”Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.Cohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started an anti-Trump social media campaign in summer 2020. Cohen said he was sent back to prison in retaliation and spent 16 days in solitary.A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in November. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen’s position but that Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.In 2020, Mary Trump sued her uncle, Donald Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump’s estate, alleging that “they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.”In November 2022, a New York state judge threw out the lawsuit, saying Mary Trump’s claims are barred by an earlier settlement she reached over 20 years ago. Mary Trump has appealed.Trump sued journalist Bob Woodward in January 2023 for alleged copyright violations, claiming Woodward had released audio from their interviews without Trump’s consent.Woodward and publisher Simon & Schuster said Trump’s case is without merit.Woodward conducted several interviews with Trump for “Rage,” published in September 2020. Woodward later released “The Trump Tapes,” an audiobook featuring eight hours of raw interviews with Trump interspersed with the author’s commentary.The former president in 2021 sued his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.Trump’s lawsuit – which is seeking “damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be no less than One Hundred Million Dollars” – alleges that Mary Trump’s disclosure of the tax information to the Times amounted to an illegal breach of contract, among other claims, because the disclosure allegedly violated the 2001 settlement agreement among the Trump family.A judge in May threw out the lawsuit against the Times.“The Times’s coverage of Donald Trump’s taxes helped inform the public through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest,” the Times said in a statement. “This lawsuit is an attempt to silence independent news organizations and we plan to vigorously defend against it.”Donald Trump also sued CNN in a southern Florida federal court last fall, accusing the network of a “campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander” that “escalated in recent months.”CNN has asked the judge for the case to be “dismissed with prejudice.”This story has been updated in May with additional developments.",politics,0.0

Kyrsten Sinema and Republicans are hoping to seize on those tensions in a state trending away from them.“It’s grab your popcorn and watch,” said GOP state Rep. Justin Wilmeth, who described the race as “the Wild, Wild West.”Sinema, who was elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 2018, became an independent in December, though she continues to caucus with her former party colleagues in the chamber. She has not yet said whether she will seek a second term in 2024.But her broken ties with Democratic voters and groups that once backed her was on display Wednesday at what was billed as a “Sinema Sold Out” rally at the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix.Carrying a papier-mâché pig as a prop to describe what they called Sinema’s courting of rich donors, members of progressive groups representing labor, immigrants and veterans called on the former Democrat to resign. Nearly all of the groups had organized and canvassed voters in the Arizona heat to elect Sinema in 2018. None of the group members CNN spoke with said they would support her again.“We’re going to work to elect a new senator who does a far better job of representing Arizona,” said Alex Alvarez, executive director of Progress Arizona. “It’s time for Kyrsten Sinema to step aside. It’s become clear that Arizonans do not want her to run again.”The contours of Arizona’s Senate race could take longer than other high-profile 2024 contests to develop. Arizona’s filing deadline is next April, and the state’s primaries aren’t until August next year.Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb last month became the first major Republican to enter the race. His campaign declined an interview request. But several other high-profile GOP contenders are weighing bids.Kari Lake, the losing Republican nominee for governor in 2022 and a prominent election denier, has teased a potential Senate bid and this week announced the release of her memoir, a move that typically precedes a political campaign.Abe Hamadeh, who lost the 2022 attorney general’s race, and Karrin Taylor Robson, who lost last year’s gubernatorial primary to Lake, have also met with National Republican Senatorial Committee officials, CNN has reported. Also in the mix could be GOP businessman Jim Lamon, who lost the party nod for the state’s other Senate seat last year.For now, though, Republicans in Arizona, after losing Senate races the past three election cycles, say they are glad the drama is on the other side at the moment.“I mean, I’m a politician, man. I’m a Republican,” said Wilmeth, the state lawmaker. “And knowing that your opponent is having problems getting to the line of scrimmage and executing their plays is good for me.”Progressives have largely rallied behind US Rep. Ruben Gallego. The five-term Phoenix-area congressman and Iraq War veteran outraised Sinema, nearly $3.8 million to $2.1 million, in 2023’s first quarter that ended March 31, Federal Election Commission filings show. But Sinema still held a significant cash advantage, with about $10 million in the bank to her opponent’s $2.7 million.Gallego has been sharply critical of the senator, casting her as beholden to lobbyists and business interests and arguing she has lost touch with Arizona since her 2-point victory over Republican Martha McSally in 2018.“She broke trust with a lot of the people of Arizona. They don’t trust her values anymore, and she’s not trying to repair that relationship,” Gallego said in an interview.Sinema’s office declined an interview request. “Kyrsten is focused on delivering real solutions, not campaign politics,” press secretary Pablo Sierra-Carmona said in a statement.A Sinema reelection bid as an independent is far from the only potential landscape-altering development ahead of Arizona’s 2024 election, though.No Labels, the business-aligned centrist group, has gained ballot access in several states. The organization has described its effort as an insurance policy if the national parties offer unacceptable presidential candidates, but Democrats in Arizona fear the group could align with Sinema in the Senate race.Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, in March recognized the “No Labels Party” as having gained ballot access in the state after meeting the minimum requirements.The Arizona Democratic Party said it filed a complaint in Maricopa County court in late March, seeking to reverse No Labels’ recognition as a political party. No Labels is registered as a nonprofit and does not disclose its donors – which the state party argued means it does not meet the requirements for a political party, including disclosing donors, registering with the FEC and following contribution limits.Meanwhile, a group of Arizona political veterans have launched Save Democracy Arizona, which advocates open primaries and ranked choice voting – a process that proponents say would give candidates incentives to appeal to moderate voters, rather than their parties’ extremes. But as supporters work to place a ranked choice initiative on the ballot next year, Republican state lawmakers are looking to advance their own ballot measure that would prohibit any experiments with the voting method.While Sinema has touted herself as an “independent voice” for a state roughly evenly divided between Republican, Democratic and unaffiliated voters, she could face a challenge attracting independent support if she runs for reelection.At a monthly meeting this week in Mesa, a group of frustrated independent voters gathered to begin organizing the petition process for ranked-choice voting. Some were supportive of Sinema. But others, like Becky Wyatt, who maintains her Democratic registration while identifying as an independent voter, said she felt the senator was inaccessible to Arizona voters.“I gave her money. I gave money on behalf of my parents for their Christmas presents in support of her,” Wyatt said. “And she is dead to me.”Other members of the group said they felt Sinema had misled voters.“Running for one party and then turning around right when you’re done and switching to independent? That’s just wrong. So she doesn’t have my support,” said Brady Busby, an independent who attended the meeting.Another independent, C.J. Diegel, said: “She just makes a lot of people angry who are responsible for her electoral future.”Clint Smith, who got 6% of the vote last year running for a deep-red US House seat outside Phoenix, said winning as an independent would be a daunting challenge despite Sinema’s huge advantages in cash on hand and name recognition.“I feel like people retreat to their corners when push comes to shove,” he said.",politics,0.0

Four months later, that position is in limbo.The internal differences emerged soon after Republicans took control of the House. In January, an effort to pass a resolution expressing support for law enforcement agencies, which was meant to serve as a messaging tool, fell apart. The House GOP’s behind-the-scenes disagreements reflect growing divisions inside the conference over whether to defund or restrict the Department of Justice and FBI. The contentious political issue is returning to center stage as CNN has learned that some House Republicans are actively sketching out ways to limit certain federal law enforcement programs through the appropriations process.The sponsor of the January resolution, GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, a former federal prosecutor, wanted to offer broad support for all levels of law enforcement. But a faction of hard-line members, led by House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio, wanted to restrict it only to state and local authorities, multiple sources told CNN.“The language that they wanted to incorporate was not something that I could agree to,” said Buck.Describing the diverging viewpoints over the issue within the House GOP conference, a separate source familiar with the negotiations in January told CNN, “We were starting a big oversight of the FBI, we didn’t want to lock ourselves in here,” referring to the Judiciary committee’s effort to investigate the FBI.Conversations with more than a dozen lawmakers since the January dust up reveal that a growing number of House Republicans are proposing ways to act on calls made by former President Donald Trump to crack down on federal law enforcement. Support started building after Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home was searched by the FBI in August 2022, as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents. And that support to act on the calls was super-charged by Trump’s indictment by the Manhattan District Attorney at the end of March.This comes as Jordan and the “weaponization” subcommittee he leads have waged a protracted campaign against the DOJ and FBI, and as House Judiciary Republicans are considering recommending various budget cuts to DOJ through the Appropriations process, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.One of the cuts House Judiciary Republicans are exploring, which could be proposed as its own legislation or part of a broader House spending package, includes restricting funding to specific DOJ departments that refuse to respond to oversight requests, a source familiar with the discussions tells CNN.Other proposals include reigning in the ability for DOJ to give out grants, and clawing back civil asset forfeiture funds obtained through a program that allows the federal government to coordinate with state and local officials to seize cash, drugs, guns and other assets from suspects before they have been convicted of a crime, the source added.CNN has also obtained multiple letters sent by House Republicans to the House Committee on Appropriations that outline specific cuts that could be made to DOJ.DOJ declined to comment. CNN has reached out to the FBI.Democrats, meanwhile, are painting any Republicans who voice support for defunding federal law enforcement as hypocritical, just as Republicans were once framing Democrats as the party that wanted to defund the police. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has said he will introduce a measure condemning Trump’s calls to defund the DOJ, seeking to create a political liability for Republicans.Calls to defund, restructure or decentralize federal law enforcement vary across the House Republican conference, both in degree and specificity. With many moderate Republicans still balking at the idea, and since the conference has yet to reveal its budget, it is unclear if any of these proposals have broad support.Some lawmakers on the far right such as Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Paul Gosar of Arizona, have carried Trump’s mantel in calling for a full defund of the FBI.GOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who floated the idea of defunding the FBI and DOJ at the Conservative Political Action Conference last year, told CNN, “I would suggest that we look internally at a line item by line-item basis in those two areas, DOJ and FBI, and make them justify everything. Start it out at a 0 basis.”Buck, meanwhile told CNN, “I will not support any drastic cut in appropriations.”While Jordan said he wanted to support rank-and-file agents at the FBI, he said vaguely “everything should be on the table” when asked what parts of federal law enforcement need to be cut and referenced a since withdrawn memo from an FBI field office focusing on extremism in the Catholic Church as an example of the kind of actions he believes need to change. Jordan has often argued, without much specificity, the best way to hold DOJ and FBI accountable is through “the power of the purse.”Some House Republicans, however, are more specific about how to restrict certain activities or restructure certain components.Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio, who acknowledged the role Trump has had in swaying members on this issue, told CNN he believes the problem “has less to do with funding and more to do with structure,” and floated an idea of using US Marshals to take over a lot of FBI’s current responsibilities, with “an entirely different law enforcement entity” taking over the bureau’s international aspects.Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN he does not believe the FBI needs a new headquarters and said he would like federal law enforcement to focus less on domestic terrorism.“I would like to take it back at a minimum to pre-9/11 to focus on crime and working with local and state jurisdictions to combat crime and not be so much dwelling on the domestic terrorism bit, which they exploited in ways that I don’t think is particularly beneficial,” he said.Roy was also one of 12 Republicans to send a letter, obtained by CNN, to the Committee on Appropriations in March requesting Congress “prohibit funding” for DOJ to enforce the FACE Act, which protects individuals obtaining an abortion as well as religious freedom.Twenty-eight House Republicans sent a separate March letter to the Appropriations subpanel that oversees DOJ funding, which was reviewed by CNN, calling for appropriators to prohibit the federal government from taking “any discriminatory action” against an individual who has the “sincerely held religious belief, or moral conviction that marriage is, or should be recognized as, a union of one man and one woman.”Another effort led by Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana to defund “woke programs” and initiatives across the federal government has included letters to each of the 12 House Appropriations subcommittees in March, and calls for no more funding to certain programs within DOJ that target diversity, equity, inclusion and climate.Multiple Republicans told CNN that they are looking to Jordan’s “weaponization” subcommittee to outline cuts for the Committee on Appropriations to carry out.Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida said the “weaponization” subcommittee must “identify and isolate” what types of cuts to the DOJ and FBI need to be made for GOP appropriators to then “take a scalpel and cut them out.”GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who serves on Jordan’s weaponization subcommittee, said the subpanel’s job is to “expose” parts of the DOJ and FBI he believes to be hurting freedom of speech for appropriators to take up.“I think at a minimum, no funds may be used to do ‘X’ are likely to be either in the bill or in amendments, where we specifically deny them certain activities,” the California Republican said. “However, you know, nobody that I know of is talking about defunding these organizations, but defunding programs.”Another weaponization committee member, Rep. Dan Bishop, acknowledged to CNN that details of what should be defunded, restructured or decentralized still need to be worked out. But the North Carolina Republican said he intends to see reforms take effect “if I do nothing else in Congress.”“The FBI and the Department of Justice obviously require very substantial reform. Precisely what that is, we’ll see,” Bishop said.Republicans on the Appropriations committee receiving these requests also present a spectrum of opinions.Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia, who sits on the specific subcommittee that oversees DOJ’s budget, told CNN, “It seems like that one of the few things that three letter agencies listen to is their budget.”Another one of those appropriators, Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas – who said he saw some “shortcomings” from DOJ and FBI leadership, but offered support to rank-and-file agents – acknowledged of his Republican colleagues on the right, “I will tell you, I know there are members of our conference that would like a pound of flesh.”Despite increasing pressure, Appropriations Committee member GOP Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio said that while things will “take a haircut” as the result of the House GOP’s proposal on the debt ceiling, “in reality, I don’t think there is ever going to be a blanket defund.”Looking at the process from across the aisle, the top Democrat on Jordan’s select subcommittee, Del. Stacey Plaskett of the US Virgin Islands, told CNN she is worried about the groundwork Republicans on the subcommittee are laying.“I am concerned about them trying to outline through their conspiracy theories and others going down their rabbit holes that they are making an argument that the FBI is an enemy of the state,” she said. “I’m concerned about they’re trying to fracture rule of law here in the country.”",politics,0.0
108,113,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/politics/north-carolina-abortion-ban-roy-cooper/index.html,North Carolina advances likely veto-proof abortion ban to governor’s desk,2023-05-04 20:02:00,"North Carolina’s Republican-controlled state Senate on Thursday passed legislation that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks.Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has vowed to veto the bill, but the GOP supermajority in the legislature can override him.The measure sped through the legislature this week, passing both chambers on party-line votes less than 48 hours after being introduced. The state House had advanced the bill on Wednesday after it was introduced Tuesday night.Cooper has previously said he plans to veto the “extreme” legislation, but if all members vote along party lines, North Carolina’s Republican state legislators have enough votes in both chambers to override any veto from Cooper.North Carolina Republicans gained a veto-proof supermajority last month when then-Democratic state Rep. Tricia Cotham switched parties. Cotham, who campaigned in favor of abortion rights as a Democrat, voted for the bill. She also sponsored legislation earlier this session to codify Roe v. Wade.In March, the state legislature overrode the governor’s veto on a bill that now makes it legal to purchase a gun without a permit in the state.Cooper doubled down on his promise to veto the abortion ban in a video statement posted to Twitter Thursday and called on a handful of Republicans, including Cotham, to keep their campaign promises.“A number of them promised their constituents that they would protect women’s reproductive rights,” Cooper told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Thursday evening. “We want to hold them to these promises.”“This is the kind of thing that happens when you let right-wing politicians into the exam room with women and their doctors,” he said, adding that “we’re going to work the next few days to make sure that we have a Republican that will stand up and vote.”CNN has reached out to the state House speaker’s office for comment.Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act,” would ban any licensed physician from performing surgical abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It would provide exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks. Under the bill, the procedure could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines an abortion is necessary to avert death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.”Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. A reduction to 12 weeks would be significant but less restrictive than some other GOP-led states that have recently enacted six-week or near-total bans on the procedure.Additionally, the bill would prohibit any health care provider who objects to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.“The refusal of a physician, nurse, or health care provider to perform or participate in these medical procedures shall not be a basis for damages for the refusal or for any disciplinary or any other recriminatory action against the physician, nurse, or health care provider,” it states.It also calls for in-person examination by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and would prohibit people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman. The bill would mandate that doctors confirm that the “probable gestational age” of a fetus is no more than ten weeks, before they can sign off on a medication abortion.This comes as a legal battle over mifepristone, one drug used in many nonsurgical abortions, looms over the US Supreme Court. North Carolina’s proposed legislation also includes significant new penalties for doctors who do not adhere to the new rules.North Carolina had been a haven for women seeking abortion care as Southern states tightened restrictions after the Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion rights back to the states.Democratic leaders across the state had spoken out against the bill and, like Cooper, said it was too extreme.US Rep. Deborah Ross said the bill was “extreme and out of touch with the needs of women and the will of the people” of the Tar Heel state.The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has praised the legislation, saying it will “lessen abortion tourism in the state.”This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
109,114,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/politics/immigration-bill-introduced-title-42-expiration/index.html,Bipartisan team introduces narrow immigration bill ahead of expiration of Covid-era border policy,2023-05-04 19:07:00,"A bipartisan group of senators led by Republican Thom Tillis of North Carolina and independent Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona introduced immigration legislation Thursday intended to counter an influx of migrants expected at the border when a Covid-era border restriction ends next week.The legislation is not a true extension of Title 42, which allowed border authorities to quickly expel certain migrants citing a public health emergency, and it’s not expected to pass before the border policy expires.But the narrow bill, according to a Sinema aide, would seek to give the Biden administration more flexibility in how it handles migrants at the border. It would give the administration a two-year expulsion authority that would apply to migrants who were trying to come to the US illegally without proper documents. The bill will include some exceptions and carveouts for migrants whose lives could be in jeopardy or who could be tortured if they were returned to their home countries. The aide said the bill would also provide some exception for migrants who are experiencing an urgent medical need.Without Title 42, the primary border enforcement tool since March 2020, authorities will be returning to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere, which is raising concerns about a surge in migrants after the border restriction is lifted – a potential political vulnerability for President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats facing reelection next year. The new legislative effort comes as the Biden administration has been racing to set in motion plans to stem the flow of migration.“What we’re trying to do is make it as clean as possible, basically extending the current policy,” Tillis told reporters. “I think that you will, after next week, have a growing number of people saying we at least need this in place so that we can sort out the fundamental problems at the border.”Sens. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, and Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, also signed onto the bill.The legislation reveals a narrow area of bipartisan support on immigration – an issue that could play a major role in the 2024 campaign. Manchin and Sinema are both weighing if they will run for reelection. Both would be among the most vulnerable senators facing reelection next year, but both have said they have time to decide on their political futures.“Despite ample notice about the pending expiration of Title 42, the Administration has failed to properly secure our southern border,” Manchin said in a statement. “The immigration crisis is only getting worse and our broken immigration system is ill-equipped to handle it. Our bipartisan legislation creates a two-year temporary solution to prevent a complete collapse at our southern border,” he said.Tillis acknowledged that the bill can’t become law before Title 42 is lifted next Thursday.“Is this bill gonna get out of the Senate, go to the House and go to the president’s desk before next Thursday? No. Is there going to be a growing sense that if the president’s not going to put any other option on the table, that it’s going to be unsustainable, unsafe and politically unwise? Yes. So, we’ll start having those discussions in the next couple of weeks,” Tillis said.",politics,0.0

Dianne Feinstein on Thursday pushed back on claims that her extended absence from the Senate, and the Judiciary Committee, as she recovers from shingles has caused a significant delay in advancing and confirming judicial nominees. Feinstein indicated in the statement that she still plans to return but did not say when that would happen.“The Senate continues to swiftly confirm highly qualified individuals to the federal judiciary, including seven more judicial nominees who were confirmed this week. There has been no slowdown,” the California Democrat said in a statement.But she acknowledged that some nominees have been blocked from moving forward during her absence. Without Feinstein, the committee is tied. Under the power-sharing agreement in the last Congress, which had a 50-50 Senate, there was a provision that allowed for a tied nominee to be discharged from committee and put on the floor. That rule is no longer in place, according to an aide on the committee. So, unless a judge has bipartisan support, the nominee fails in committee and doesn’t come to the floor.“I’m disappointed that Republicans on the committee are blocking a few from moving forward. I’m confident that when I return to the Senate, we will be able to move the remaining qualified nominees out of committee quickly and to the Senate floor for a vote,” she said.While Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has not called for Feinstein to resign, he previously acknowledged to CNN that the 89-year-old senator’s absence has slowed down their push to confirm nominees.“I can’t consider nominees in these circumstances because a tie vote is a losing vote in committee,” Durbin said.Asked if her absence has longer ramifications on the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Senate chairman said, “Yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time.In April, Feinstein asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace her on the Judiciary Committee, and he proposed that Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin take her spot. However, Senate Republicans made it clear that they would block any attempt to put someone else on the committee.The committee’s top GOP member, Sen. Lindsey Graham, said at the time, “She’s a dear friend and we hope for her speedy recovery and return back to the Senate. With all due respect, my colleague, Senator Schumer, this is about a handful of judges that you can’t get the votes for.”Feinstein announced in early March that she had contracted shingles and was hospitalized. Since then, she has been recovering at home in California. Feinstein has not voted in the Senate since February 16.",politics,0.0

Unlike the other defendants in this trial, Pezzola is not alleged to have a leadership position in the organization and was inactive in Proud Boys group chats.All five defendants were found guilty of other charges related to January 6, including: obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging any duties; obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder; and destruction of government property and aiding and abetting.Each of the defendants were convicted of at least one charge that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence, and could face a lengthy amount of time behind bars. A sentencing date for the five defendants has not yet been scheduled. District Judge Timothy Kelly said it is likely to happen in late July.The jury did not reach a verdict with regards to some defendants on charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers as well as destruction of government property and aiding and abetting. A mistrial was declared on those counts.In court, as each juror was polled, Tarrio – dressed in a three-piece suit – peered over the desk, straining his neck to watch the jury. Rehl shook his head as he was convicted of seditious conspiracy while the others sat still in their chairs.After the jurors left, several defendants and attorneys shook hands, hugged, and exchanged brief words. Family for the defendants cried together in a hallway outside the courtroom.Attorney General Merrick Garland said the verdict “makes clear that the Justice Department will do everything in its power to defend the American people and American democracy.”“The evidence presented at trial detailed the extent of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, and the central role these defendants played in setting into motion the unlawful events of that day,” he told reporters at the Justice Department.Garland said that the DOJ’s massive investigation into the Capitol riot “has secured more than 600 convictions for a wide range of criminal conduct” during the attack and in the days leading up to it.Lawyers for some of the defendants provided mixed reactions to reporters outside the courthouse, with Tarrio’s attorney, Nayib Hassan, saying that although he did not agree with the jury’s decision, he respected it.“At this point in time we’re currently drafting all the appellate paperwork to proceed forward,” Hassan said.Steven Metcalf, a defense attorney for Pezzola, said he, too, would be appealing the verdict, but praised the jury for acquitting Pezzola of seditious conspiracy.“Dominic Pezzola was ultimately separated from the seditious conspiracy charge,” Metcalf said. “Which is what I set out to do over a year and a half ago and which I was able to accomplish.”Asked how Rehl was feeling, attorney Carmen Hernandez told reporters that her client was “not happy.”“This week is his wife’s birthday, his wedding anniversary, his little girl will be two years old in June. It’s not a happy day,” she said.“We’re very disappointed,” Hernandez said. “I don’t believe he committed seditious conspiracy … but the jury has spoken and that’s our system of justice. I’m very disappointed in the verdict.”Nick Smith, who represents Nordean, declined to comment on the verdict to reporters inside the courthouse. Biggs’ attorney, Norman Pattis, also declined to comment, but later said on Twitter, “It was a difficult trial. The appeal is promising. Much love to the Boys and their supporters.”The conviction of Tarrio is especially significant, even though he was not in Washington, DC, on January 6. According to the indictment, the Proud Boys leader helped to create a command structure within the Proud Boys in the lead up to January 6.Text and Signal messages highlighted in the indictment suggest that Tarrio was preparing for a “revolution,” and reviewed documents that set forth a plan to occupy a few “crucial buildings” in Washington, including House and Senate office buildings around the Capitol.Tarrio was arrested on January 4, 2021, for bringing high-capacity rifle magazines to DC and ordered to leave the city.During the trial, using messages and videos posted by the defendants and other members of the group, prosecutors laid out the case that the Proud Boys, animated by Trump and his election lies after the 2020 defeat, began calling for violence and revolution against the incoming Biden presidency.Members of the group saw Biden and others on the left as a threat to the country, according to prosecutors, and messaged one another about the need for “war,” “revolution,” and firing squads for traitors.On January 6, prosecutors said, many of the defendants didn’t attend Trump’s speech that day but instead began a march to the Capitol.Proud Boys were at the front lines of the mob on Capitol grounds and were there when the first barriers were breached. Prosecutors have alleged that leaders of the group riled members up and communicated with them, through hand signals, to move ahead.After rioters had arrived at Senate wing doors of the Capitol building, Pezzola used a police riot shield he stole during the attack to break open a window, prosecutors said, which rioters entered the Capitol through.Defense attorneys have argued that their clients never had a plan to storm the Capitol and stop the electoral college vote that day. The messages and videos show nothing more than stupid, vulgar rhetoric, defense attorneys said, hardly a seditious plot against the US government.Often teetering into disarray with legal battles, evidentiary disputes, sealed hearings, countless calls for a mistrial and several shouting matches with the judge, the trial concluded last Tuesday with the final closing arguments from defense counsel and federal prosecutors.During the trial, jurors listened to testimony from multiple officers who defended the Capitol on January 6 as well as FBI agents who investigated the Proud Boys and testimony from several Proud Boys members, including two of the defendants, none of whom said there was ever a specific plan to take the Capitol.The countless delays, brought on by newly unveiled evidence and informants, a juror who believed they were being followed, and internecine squabbles among attorneys pushed a trial originally estimated to last five to seven weeks to stretch across four months.This story has been updated with additional developments.",politics,0.0

Previous administrations have deemed such a move as unworkable.“There is no way to protect our financial system and our economy other than Congress doing its job and raising the debt ceiling,” Yellen said.Adeyemo also tamped down the feasibility of using the 14th Amendment when asked about it Sunday, saying the “the only way” to “guarantee” that the US can pay its bills is to raise the debt ceiling.Biden, whose White House has said that it will accept only a clean proposal to raise the debt limit, is set to sit down with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, and other congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss the debt ceiling.House Financial Services Chairman Patrick McHenry expressed “modest pessimism” Sunday at the prospect of a debt deal coming together.The North Carolina Republican suggested on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the ultimate compromise to raise the debt limit would look “a lot like the bill we passed out of the House,” adding that “at this stage of the game, the one key ingredient I don’t have is what the administration would come to terms with.”That bill, which would raise the nation’s $31. 4 trillion borrowing limit by an additional $1.5 trillion and slash federal spending, is unlikely to be taken up by the Democratic-led Senate. But the measure is primarily aimed at boosting Republicans’ efforts to negotiate with Democrats.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York called the GOP proposal a “ransom note” on Sunday, labeling it the “Default on America Act.”“Either Republicans want us to accept these dramatic cuts or accept a catastrophic default on our nation’s debt. That is what is the unreasonable position and hopefully in a few days Republicans will come to their senses and do what’s right by the American people,” Jeffries said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, meanwhile, said Republicans and the White House must explore options for raising the debt ceiling because neither position has the votes to pass.“The reality is the bill that Kevin (McCarthy) and his colleagues passed through the House is not going to be the solution. The votes do not exist in the United States Senate to pass that. But what the president is offering is not a realistic solution either. There’s not going to be just a simple clean debt limit. The votes don’t exist for that,” Sinema told CBS on Sunday.She said the two sides need to negotiate a solution that will “protect the full faith and credit of the United States of America.”This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
113,118,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/business/lululemon-dupe-culture/index.html,Lulu who? A cult brand takes on the booming culture of ‘dupes’,2023-05-07 12:27:00,"Scroll through TikTok, and there’s a dupe for seemingly everything.Don’t want to spend $98 on lululemon leggings? Try these $27 alternatives. If a Skims bodysuit is too much, a smiling influencer will show you exactly where you can find a similar one in their Amazon storefront. Even dupes for the $45 Stanley water bottle exist.The hashtag #dupe – or cheaper alternatives to household names or luxury brands, but not considered counterfeits because most don’t make an effort to fake logos – has racked up billions of views. And one pricey brand is taking the trend head on by offering the real thing.This weekend, athleisure giant lululemon is hosting a dupe swap at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles. Bring a knock-off pair, lulu said, and they’ll swap it out for the black Align High Rise Pant 25”.The Align Pants, which launched in 2015, have something of a cult. Fans of lululemon claim the real ones are lightweight and buttery-soft. But they are also one of the most duped products on TikTok.Go on TikTok, and you’ll see a pair of twins wearing Aligns and a $27 Amazon dupe side-by-side (their Amazon storefront is linked in the bio). “Lulu who?” another said, holding up two tank tops with “literally” the exact same stitching.Because, instead of hiding a knockoff’s true origins, it’s pretty cool to find a dupe now. Call it recession-core or Gen Z’s anti-consumerism sentiments, but #dupe has amassed more than 3.5 billion views on TikTok. One trend shows young people loudly (and ironically) shouting “DUPE!” through store windows.Before, finding knock offs was a lowkey way to way to find affinity to a luxury brand. But now “it’s a flex to have the dupe,” Northwestern marketing professor Jacqueline Babb said.Lulu has been “hyper aware” of dupe culture, its Chief Brand Officer Nikki Neuburger said in an interview with CNN Business. (The #lululemondupe tag has 180 million views alone, the  company said.)“We saw it as a really fun way to play into something that is a real part of our culture, but in a way that really puts the focus back on the original,” she said. The LA location was chosen strategically – it’s a center for creators and content generation. Similar events are planned in London, Shanghai and Seoul.Lulu is making sure customers don’t go hold on to their fakes, which will be sent to a textile recycling company. “The premise of the event is to trade in your qualifying dupe product and experience lululemon’s Align Pant,” says the website.Though lululemon has acknowledged dupes exist, there isn’t much brands can do to stop their popularity through social media, Northwestern marketing professor Alexander Chernev said.“You have people who are able to tell the story or inform other people about what’s in fashion, influence this behavior, and they can do it faster than the original product,” Chernev said, adding it’s difficult for companies to legally protect and keep up with copies of their design.Dupes could come from dubious places and can easily be found online. HeyNuts, one of the brands with thousands of reviews hailing it as a Lulu dupe, doesn’t have a clear store origin, though the leggings are made in China and available on Amazon.Amazon has “no tolerance for counterfeit items,” a spokesperson said, and has measures in place to pursue bad actors who attempt to use social media to sell them.Some TikTokkers are turning dupes into a major source of income.22-year-old Hannah Slye’s account, whose bio says she “can’t stop buying things,” has more than 98,000 followers and about 3.7 million likes. During the two-day Prime Early Access Sale in October, Slye earned upwards of four to five thousand dollars through her affiliate links.Slye’s favorite dupe is a gold chain that resembles a necklace from Christian Dior – but no one has called her out for the fake. It’s just about having the designer inspired look.“I’m from a very, very small town in Pennsylvania,” Slye said. “So you know, we don’t see a lot of people wearing designer around here.”Some experts argue dupe culture encourages a trend cycle that makes products out of date within months. Why invest in a high-quality piece, one could say, when they could mindlessly scroll and purchase the dupe with free two-day shipping?Impulse buying has become a chronic way to spend time, Baylor University researcher on consumer behavior James Roberts said, exacerbated by constant access to cheaper goods.“They send you products are consistent with algorithms, lots of products for things you need for lower prices, and it can become a vicious cycle,” Roberts said.Some legacy brands can be immune to this – Patagonia and Nike are examples, Babb said, of brands that have a lot of meaning. And Gen Z, who tends to be more concerned about where their money goes, is probably more attuned to brands like this than they’d like to admit, Babb said.“Patagonia wants you to wear their jacket until it rips, then they fix it for you. That is much more resonant with Gen Z,” Babb said.Indeed, there’s a lot of loyalty to legacy brands. Though lululemon may be leading in dupe hashtags on TikTok, the Align line that began in 2015 remains its top seller, the company said.",style,0.0
114,119,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/media/writers-strike-reliable-sources/index.html,No end in sight for the writers strike as talks break off and both sides brace for long standoff,2023-05-07 10:24:00,"It’s a script without an ending.Since the Writers Guild of America went on strike Tuesday after failing to hammer out a deal with the major studios, all of which are represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the two sides have been at an absolute standstill.I’m told that there have been no negotiations since the strike commenced and that there are no negotiating sessions currently on the books. When I asked a studio executive on Wednesday evening when they expect talks to resume, the person replied, “No idea, no idea.”“There is no way of knowing,” the executive added.Both sides have dug their heels in the sand over a small number of significant issues, and neither side is willing to budge at the moment. It is, after all, impossible to negotiate until a non-negotiable condition for one party becomes a negotiable.What the executive I spoke to did underscore is that the studios have plenty of content in the bank to keep their hungry audiences happy. And in recent years, the executive pointed out, viewers have actually struggled to keep up with all the new shows and movies that have been released on streaming platforms.“We are not going to have test patterns on any TV any time soon,” the executive joked, noting that streaming catalogs are filled to the brim with shows and movies for people to watch.The executive is not wrong. Outside of fans of the venerable late-night comedy institutions, it is going to take quite a while for the average viewer to see the impacts of the ongoing strike. Think for a minute: Has the strike impacted your television viewing habits yet? I’m betting not.In other words, the standoff will likely have to endure for a lengthy period until it becomes unbearable for either side. And it just might.The WGA has signaled that the work stoppage could last for many months. And if the guild wants to apply real pressure to the studios, it’s hard to see how it would not push the strike deep into the summer.Which is all to say, strap yourself in for the long haul.",business,0.0
115,120,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/business/stocks-week-ahead/index.html,Wall Street’s still worried despite Friday’s fakeout,2023-05-07 07:35:00,"Stocks saw a comeback on Friday after four consecutive days of declines. But there are several key signs that show the market is far from shedding its worries.The Dow surged about 547 points on Friday, marking its biggest one-day gain since early January. The S&P 500 rose 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%.Still, the Dow and S&P 500 fell for the week, and the Nasdaq just barely eked out a gain. The major indexes saw steep sell-offs earlier in the week after First Republic’s collapse, its subsequent sale to JPMorgan Chase and reports that other regional banks were exploring strategic options spurred fears about the banking sector’s stability.Investors say Friday’s move was a short-term reversal, and not indicative of long-lasting optimism. In other words, Wall Street still has concerns about the banking sector’s health, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory and the possibility of recession.“The larger themes that we’ve been thinking about are still very much in place,” said David Keller, chief market strategist at StockCharts.com.That was evident in several aspects of the market.Defensive sectors: The S&P 500’s health, utilities and information technology sectors rose for the week and outperformed the broad-based index. That suggests investors are positioning themselves defensively to weather potential market turbulence ahead.Health and utility stocks tend to perform well during recessions, since consumers prioritize paying for necessities like electricity and health care over discretionary purchases when their budgets are tight.While information technology is not a traditionally defensive sector, its gains were driven by mega-cap tech stocks like Apple that have been popular safety picks for investors this year.Oil: Crude prices fell for the third straight week, as turmoil in the banking sector and the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hike strengthened fears that the economy is headed for a downturn.West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US benchmark for oil, last week fell briefly below $70 a barrel for the first time since late March. Crude prices this year have also fallen well below record highs from 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent prices soaring above $100 a barrel.Oil prices also saw a flash-crash early Thursday, falling briefly to about $63 a barrel, indicating that Wall Street is fearful about how a potential recession could stymie oil demand.VIX: The VIX, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose roughly 9% this week after falling for six straight weeks.The April Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index are on deck for next week. Both are key inflation prints that could help determine the Fed’s next course of action in its battle against inflation.In March, annual CPI plunged to its lowest rate since May 2021, while the PPI saw a dramatic cooldown. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, also eased.But a strong April jobs report has renewed concerns that the economy is still too hot. The economy added 253,000 jobs in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployment fell to 3.4%, matching a 53-year low reached in January. Economists had expected 180,000 jobs to be added and a 3.6% unemployment rate, according to Refinitiv.The unexpected jump in job gains after cooling economic data in recent weeks suggests that the Federal Reserve could have more room to tighten the economy. If next week’s inflation data further supports the notion that the economy is hot, that could increase the likelihood that the central bank keeps interest rates higher for longer.“Even with the improvements that we’ve seen over the past few months in year-over-year inflation data, the level of overall inflation remains too high on an absolute basis,” said Sam Millette, fixed income strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.While economists and investors believe the Fed could pause interest rates at its next meeting in June, some are concerned that the central bank’s willingness to raise rates even after three bank failures suggests that it could continue inflicting pain on the economy. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter point and opened the door to a pause later this year.“What it really says is that the economy is not in trouble, can easily handle slightly higher rates, and that the regional banking indigestion of the higher rates is not a reason to stop the fight to slow inflation,” Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates, wrote in a note Friday.Monday: March wholesale inventories and first-quarter Fed Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.Tuesday: Earnings report from Airbnb (ABNB).Wednesday: April Consumer Price Index and earnings report from Disney (DIS).Thursday: April Producer Price Index, mortgage rates and jobless claims.Friday: University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations for May.",business,0.0

Instead, the latest jobs report showed the unemployment rate fell to 3.4% in April after 253,000 jobs were added last month.But hiring isn’t strong across the board, and is concentrated in a handful of industries.“Employers continue to hire for in-demand skills while pulling back on non-essential headcount,” said Becky Frankiewicz, president and chief commercial officer at ManpowerGroup, a staffing agency.The bulk of the new jobs last month came from gains in professional and business services, health care, leisure and hospitality, specialized construction contractors and food and drinking services.In total these five industries hired 165,000 new workers in April. That amounts to 65% of the overall jobs added.Professional and business services, which include a wide range of jobs such as accountants, lawyers and engineers, added 43,000 jobs, the biggest gain across all industries. Average hourly earnings for workers in the industry rose by $0.24 to $40.20. That’s 20% higher than what the average private-sector worker earned last month.Even though the jobs report showed a net positive gain, there were some sizable layoffs.The largest cuts hit workers who are involved in helping other workers get hired, such as recruiters, careers coaches and human resources professionals. Across that industry, known as employment services, there were 24,000 layoffs last month.“It’s the year of efficiency,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. “Companies are telling recruiters to do more with less and to cut costs after two years of spending whatever it takes to fill vacancies.”Some of the other notable job cuts were in transit and ground passenger services, where 8,100 workers were laid off; and building construction, where 3,600 workers were laid off. Transit and passenger service jobs include people who work within mass transit system as well as taxi and school bus drivers.Commercial real estate is under a lot of stress lately. Many employees continue to work from home, leaving an abundance of office building floors vacant. Higher interest rates have also caused developers to delay new construction projects.",business,0.0

No cap.The fitness center franchiser and operator, which runs 2,400 gyms in the US and Canada, has launched its third year of its High School Summer Pass program during Mental Health Awareness Month.Touted as a way to keep high schoolers active during summer in a “fun, safe and judgment-free zone,” the annual program is open to teens aged 14 to 19.No gym class for three months? No problem. Included in the summerlong freebie: exercise plans tailored to their age group and workouts with certified trainers.A Wired Research survey commissioned by and for Planet Fitness found teens want to make positive, healthy lifestyle changes: 75% of surveyed teens said they’re “ready and willing” to start working out at the gym.For those in need of a little motivation, Planet Fitness is throwing in an incentive. Ten teens participating in the program could win $10,000 individual academic scholarships through a TikTok video contest. They have to share an online clip describing their High School Summer Pass experience to be considered.Data reveal teens struggle with their overall wellness. It’s a key reason Planet Fitness launched the program, which enrolled 3.5 million high schoolers last year, the company said.Around 22% of 12 to 19-year-olds in the US are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which labels childhood obesity as a serious health problem.Kids between 5 and 17 years old should be moderately or vigorously active with mostly aerobic exercise for at least an hour a day to reap the physical and mental health benefits, the World Health Organization recommends.This year’s High School Summer Pass launch during Mental Health Awareness Month is no accident. Planet Fitness program organizers want teens to make both mental and physical wellness a priority while their academic, extracurricular and after-school activities are on pause, according to the company’s news release.The CDC’s 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found 29% of high schoolers suffer from poor mental health – and the percentage has steadily increased since the survey was first conducted in 2011.The Wired Research survey s found 61% of teens face mental health struggles.Physical activity has been shown to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in young people, according to a 2020 British Medical Journal study.Planet Fitness referenced 2020 research from the Human Kinetics Journal, which found students who exercised enough performed better in school compared to those who didn’t.Teens can register now before free club access starts May 15, and those under 18 have to sign up with a parent or guardian, Planet Fitness said in the news release.

120,125,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/media/south-korea-youtube-influence-politics-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,How YouTube became a force for free speech in South Korea,2023-05-07 03:07:00,"YouTube’s most watched daily live program in South Korea might surprise you. It is not about K-pop, it is not a K-drama, and has nothing to do with BlackPink.It is a provocative current affairs talk show called “Gyeomson (Modesty) is Nothing,” fronted by an irreverent host, Kim Ou-joon, whose lack of deference to authority is making waves in a country where traditional media has a reputation for respectful coverage.Kim’s style is reminiscent of a US late-night chat show host. Openly partisan, he says his aim is to counter-balance what he sees as a bias toward the conservative government with a liberal voice.“Conservative media are actively making biased reports, and I think they can do that based on their political stance,” Kim told CNN. “The problem here is that they’re pretending to be fair, hiding behind the mask of fairness.”Kim’s brash style stands out all the more given recently raised concerns by the US Department of State that South Korean officials are using defamation lawsuits to restrict freedom of expression.It highlighted in a March human rights report the case of broadcaster MBC, which is being sued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry for a story in which it claimed the South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had been caught on a hot mic making less-than complimentary remarks about US lawmakers.The presidential office has criticized the State Department report for “a lack of accuracy,” claiming it had “simply collected and announced the claims of civic groups or media reports.”But taking on the conservative administration doesn’t faze Kim, who has been sued for defamation on several occasions.Kim’s critics meanwhile say his taste for controversy goes only one way, accusing him of paying less attention to reports involving the liberal Democratic Party.Still, the show’s reputation for daring to go where others fear to tread has done wonders for its viewing figures. Every morning at 7:05 a.m., about 160,000 people tune in to hear Kim’s takes on the biggest issues of the day.Industry observers say the program’s popularity – it has more than 1 million subscribers and can rake in donations of 90 million won ($70,000) a day – reflects a changing media landscape.Increasingly, they say, current affairs programs are turning to YouTube to disseminate their content, drawn both by large audiences and the perception that the online arena grants greater space for freedom of expression.“Modesty is Nothing,” for instance, is the reincarnation of a radio show called “News Factory” that was taken off air after a row with the government.YouTube has a high penetration in South Korea. According to Statista, a market and consumer data statistics site, there were over 46 million YouTube users in South Korea as of January this year – more than 90% of the population (compared to over 70% in the United States).Most traditional media outlets now run their own YouTube channels, as do an increasing number of smaller, independent companies, of all political persuasions – like the right-wing Tubeshin (1.46 million subscribers) and the left-wing Newstapa (over 1 million).YouTube’s growing influence was demonstrated in the run-up to last year’s general election, when Yoon – then a candidate for the People Power Party – saw his popularity fall following a stumbling performance in a Christmas Day YouTube interview with 3ProTV.Before the show he had been neck-and-neck with opponent Lee Jae-myung from the (then ruling) Democratic Party of Korea; soon after a Gallup survey showed him trailing by around 8% points.The clout of both right and left-wing channels has also been shown in recent movements. Right-wing channels fueled rallies in support of the former President Park Geun-hye after she was impeached in 2017 over a corruption scandal; they also backed protests outside the retirement home of her liberal successor Moon Jae-in. Left-wing channels backed counter-rallies outside the current President Yoon’s home.Last year the former leader of Yoon’s party hit out at what he said was the “evil influence” of YouTube channels.YouTube channels are seen as offering a space for free speech that is all the more important given the concerns voiced by the US State Department.Jung June-hee, a professor of media at South Korea’s Hanyang University ERICA campus, said most traditional outlets avoided criticizing the government – partly because of their own right-wing leanings but also because they feared being sued.“After President Yoon Suk Yeol came to power, there have been many cases where the presidential office filed complaints to the media,” Jung said.“The fear of being targeted, whether you’re on the same side or not, is significant,” Jung said.Over time, the lack of critical coverage meant citizens had lost confidence in traditional media and turned to the internet instead, said Rhee June-woong, a professor in communication at Seoul National University.“We can’t say that traditional newspapers and broadcast media have been completely abandoned, but more and more citizens are dissatisfied with them and are seeking information, interpretation, and expression in internet media,” Rhee said.CNN asked the presidential office to comment on its recent defamation lawsuits, but it has not yet received a reply.It’s a dynamic that’s not lost on Kim. His previous show, the publicly funded “News Factory” program, had for years been Seoul’s top-rated radio program (and made him one of the country’s highest paid presenters).Debuting in 2016 on TBS in a two-hour slot Monday to Friday, its format was simple, featuring Kim’s comments on the topic of the day and a news roundup, followed by segments featuring newsmakers from politicians and professors to journalists, artists and scientists.Its no-holds barred approach to news analysis and its live interviews broke the mold in South Korean media and made it a go-to show for politicos, said Jung June-hee, a media professor at Hanyang University.“(Previously) politicians didn’t appear on radio shows, and morning radio shows … (mostly) used to summarize news from the night before and deliver information such as real-time traffic updates,” Jung said.But its oppositional style angered conservatives, as did its coverage of the scandal surrounding former President Park. When a conservative administration returned to power in 2022 (following a stint by liberal Moon Jae-in, under whom the show enjoyed a heyday), its days were numbered.Soon after, the conservative city council announced it planned to cut TBS’s budget in a move widely seen as reflecting its displeasure with “News Factory.”While Seoul’s Mayor Oh Se-hoon denied the link, in February he criticized the show for being “one-sided,” and the network TBS for “crossing the line that public broadcasting cannot possibly cross.”“In any country, people can never be patient when public broadcasting is biased and in favor of a particular political party,” Oh said.Kim took “News Factory” off air in December. The next month, he launched “Modesty is Nothing.”The only real differences between the shows are the name and medium. The format is the same and even the studio is a replica, though it has now grown bigger – in line with Kim’s ambitions.Within a week, it had surpassed a million subscribers. It has since consistently ranked top in terms of real-time daily viewership on YouTube in South Korea.To Professor Jung, it’s a success that demonstrates “voices cannot be silenced.”Kim, meanwhile, hopes to build a show with as much recognition as any on traditional media.“I will create a type of press that has not yet existed on YouTube,” Kim said. “This is a declaration that I will show that canceling the show for a political reason was wrong.”",politics,0.0

So far this year, it is faring better, posting an underwriting profit of $703 million in this year’s Q1, thanks to higher average premiums and lower advertising costs, despite lower claims frequencies.However, Berkshire’s energy company and freight railroad company, BNSF, had a decrease in earnings compared to this quarter last year.Berkshire also bought back approximately $4.4 billion in stocks, and its cash hoard increased to $130.6 billion from $128 billion in 2022 Q4.Coined “Woodstock for Capitalists,” the annual meeting will feature Buffett, 92, and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, 99, who took the stage on Saturday to answer questions from shareholders and engage in discussion about the business and broader economy.",business,0.0

Many venues and markets opened fully for the first time since the global pandemic began in 2020.But the success comes at a time a handful of bills are wending their way through Congress that target the company’s controversial and widely criticized ticketing practices and near-monopoly in the business.CEO Michael Rapino, in a release, credited the company’s most recent results in part to  stadium tours for superstars Beyonce, Drake and Bruce Springsteen.“Demand was so strong that even when artists added a number of additional shows, they still were not able to meet all of the fan demand,” Rapino said.In a single day last November, more than two million Taylor Swift tickets were sold on Live Nation’s Ticketmaster, a record for any artist. But those sales came with hours of delays, confusion and misinformation.A near-meltdown of the site ended up denying millions of fans – including those with presale codes – the chance to buy tickets.Eventually, the ticketing company canceled the public sale due to “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand.”But this week the company posted earnings above analyst expectations and $320 million in first-quarter adjusted operating income, up 53% from a year ago. Live Nation stock rose about 15% on the news, to close at about $77 a share.Rapino said the company is “watching what’s going on” in regards to legislation in an earnings call. In February, the company announced support for the FAIR ticketing act, which would let artists decide resale rules and crack down on bots and resellers.“Through all of the noise, most people are ending up in the industry and politics at exactly where we are and the principles of what the FAIR Act is,” Rapino said.Rapino also said some of the legislation “swirling around” should help rein in scalpers, which the company blamed for crashing the site during Taylor Swift.“The common theme in all of this legislation that you’re seeing come forward is around limiting and putting some handcuffs around the scalper and the business,” Rapino said.Ticketmaster and Live Nation face a lawsuit from Swifties across the country who filed the suit in December for “unlawful conduct” in the pop star’s chaotic tour sale, claiming that the ticketing giant violated antitrust laws, among others.Fans of the Eurovision Song Contest were also unable to access Ticketmaster’s site in March.Lawmakers grilled Live Nation president and CFO Joe Berchtold in a three-hour hearing in January, alleging the ticketing giant wields too much monopolistic control over the industry.Jack Groetzinger, CEO of SeatGeek, alleged in the hearing that many venue owners “fear losing Live Nation concerts if they don’t use Ticketmaster” and its services, and argued the company must be broken up.“I want to congratulate and thank you for an absolutely stunning achievement,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal pointedly said to Berthtold. “You have brought together Republicans and Democrats in an absolutely unified cause.”Blumenthal and Sen. Amy Klobuchar introduced legislation in April to “improve competition in live event ticketing markets.”“Right now, one company is leveraging its power to lock venues into exclusive contracts that last up to ten years, ensuring there is no room for potential competitors to get their foot in the door,” said Klobuchar in a release.",business,0.0
123,128,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/business/ntsb-automatic-driving-safety/index.html,"‘The federal government is not doing their job,’ NTSB chair says about automated driving tech",2023-05-06 08:04:00,"National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy sharply criticized federal regulators Thursday for not doing enough to monitor and test automatic driving technologies.She spoke at an event marking the opening of a Consumer Reports facility that will test increasingly common systems and features such as automatic braking, lane-departure technology and advanced cruise control. More than half of new vehicles sold today have at least some of these systems, according to Consumer Reports.“The federal government isn’t doing their job in that area. You’re ahead of them,” Homendy said of Consumer Reports. “The NTSB has called on regulators to set performance minimums for these features, to test vehicles rigorously against those standards and provide the results to consumers. But we’re still waiting.”Private groups like Consumer Reports and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by the insurance industry, have the ability to respond more quickly than government agencies in the face of rapidly advancing technologies, said Kelly Funkhouser, head of connected and automated vehicles at Consumer Reports.In reality, both public and private agencies are needed to prod safety improvements, she said. She gave the example of automatic emergency braking, a technology that has been proven to reduce crashes and which is now standard on most passenger vehicles sold in the US. That’s because the IIHS and Consumer Reports worked directly with automakers to get them to add it.“Consumer Reports and IIHS tried to get ahead of this because there was no movement from regulators,” she said.The NTSB is not a regulatory agency, and can only offer recommendations to private industry, such as automakers, and other agencies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.NHTSA is the federal agency that regulates auto safety and maintains a database of crash test ratings at SaferCar.gov. It also lists which basic crash prevention systems vehicles have, such as “Crash Imminent Braking”– more commonly called automatic emergency braking – and “Lane Departure Warning.” It also lists whether each one “meets performance criteria.”But it doesn’t provide comparative ratings or details. For instance, some emergency braking systems can stop collisions only at very low speeds, said Funkhouser. Also, some don’t stop for pedestrians or bicyclists, but others will.The NTSB has suggested NHTSA employ a five-star rating system to forward collision avoidance systems, for example, instead of just noting whether they meet minimum standards.And NHTSA has proposed updates to the rating system, including possibly requesting comment on ways to develop ratings systems for these technologies. It has also recently begun its own rulemaking process for automatic emergency braking technologyConsumer Reports’ new “ADAS Loop” at the organization’s auto testing center in Colchester, Connecticut is designed to test advanced driver assist systems like Tesla’s Autopilot, and similar systems from automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Nissan and General Motors.These systems can combine technologies like automated lane-keeping assistance and automated cruise control to make vehicles seem almost like they’re driving themselves.Crucially, though, vehicles with these systems are not self-driving cars. For the most part, these systems operate only in relatively simple driving situations, such as on multi-lane highways without intersections, and a human driver should be paying attention at all times.Consumer Reports test drivers will still use an actual interstate highway to test features that only function when the car recognizes that it’s on a divided highway. (Certain technologies from some automakers are restricted using GPS location settings and can be enabled only on an actual highway.)But the independent test track includes intersections, on and off ramps, curves and hills to test how the systems respond to a variety of different road situations.Test drivers will be able to check how well systems work compared to one another.They will also be able to compare how good of a job they do at making sure drivers are really paying attention and at alerting drivers if their attention wanders.“ADAS technologies need to be tested thoroughly,” Homendy said. “The stakes couldn’t be higher. People put immense trust in these features, sometimes too much.”The NTSB has investigated numerous crashes involving Tesla’s Autopilot automated driving system and has noted that it is too easy for drivers to become distracted. Many vehicles, including Teslas, rely on just the slight pull of a driver’s hand on the steering wheel to indicate that the driver is staying alert. Much better are systems that use cameras inside the car to watch the driver’s eyes and ensure that the driver is actually looking at the road, said Funkhouser.",business,0.0
124,129,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/economy/april-jobs-report-takeaways/index.html,"What the April jobs report means for you, your employer, and the Fed",2023-05-05 18:47:00,"High prices, rising interest rates and banking uncertainty be damned: The US labor market is still chugging right along.Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.That’s a good chunk more than economists were expecting, making this jobs report the 12th out of the last 13 to come in “hot.”Here are some takeaways from the report and what it could mean for workers, job seekers, employers, the Federal Reserve and everyone in between:When the Federal Reserve started its inflation-busting campaign back in March 2022, concerns grew about the potential collateral damage: How many Americans could lose their jobs as a result?The blunt-force effect of rate hikes — that make borrowing money more costly and in turn reduce demand and prices — was expected to send a chill through the nation’s red-hot labor market, which at the time had a historically low 3.6% unemployment rate.Fourteen months and 5 percentage points later, the economy added more than a quarter of a million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped down again to a decades-low 3.4%.“The American labor market right now is simply unstoppable,” RSM economist Joseph Brusuelas wrote in a note Friday. “It’s a little like how sports commentators used to describe defending basketball great Michael Jordan: One can’t stop him, one can only hope to contain him.”And for job seekers and workers, that’s a great thing:“You want a job, it’s yours for the asking,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in a note.Last month’s job growth may have been stronger than economists expected, but the latest BLS report also noted that the previously reported estimates for February and March were revised downward by a combined 149,000 jobs.Those revisions bring average job growth down to 222,000 for the past three months. While that’s above the average 183,000 monthly gain seen in the decade before the pandemic, it’s a far cry below what was seen during the economic rebound of the past two years (when monthly job gains averaged 399,000 in 2022 and 606,000 in 2021).“We are seeing a slowing in the labor market, and that’s good news from an inflation perspective,” Gus Faucher, chief economist with the PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN. “Businesses are still trying to hire, demand for labor is still strong, but it’s not quite as strong as it was even in late 2022. For businesses, it looks like they’re finding that perhaps it’s a little bit easier to find workers now.”The ongoing resilience of the labor market also helps to bolster hopes that it’s still possible for the Fed to bring down inflation without jettisoning millions of people to the unemployment rolls and triggering a recession.“This is what a soft landing would look like, with job growth gradually slowing to a more sustainable pace,” Faucher added. “That being said, we won’t know whether we’ve achieved a soft landing probably until the end of this year.”The Black unemployment rate tumbled to a record low in April for the second month in a row, providing fresh evidence of America’s historic jobs boom.The Black unemployment rate dropped to 4.7% last month, compared with 5% the prior month. That marks the lowest level on records that go back to 1972 and is a sharp drop from 5.7% as recently as February.The milestone comes just three years after the Covid-19 pandemic caused mass layoffs that pushed the Black unemployment rate as high as 16.8%.While on its face this is promising news, the rate decline was accompanied by a drop in Black labor force participation and employment, said Heidi Shierholz, a former Labor Department chief economist who now serves as the president of the Economic Policy Institute.“Make no mistake, the Black [unemployment] rate is still too high,” Shierholz tweeted. “Due to the impact of structural racism on the labor market, [Black & Hispanic workers] have much higher [unemployment] rates than White [workers]. But the strong jobs recovery has brought [Black and Hispanic unemployment] down far faster than in the past.”Friday’s jobs report showed that average hourly earnings grew in April by 16 cents, or 0.5%, to $33.36, the biggest month-over-month gain since March 2022, though wage growth had cooled since then.From a year earlier, wages increased 4.4%, up slightly from the prior month, but down from the 5.9% rise in March of last year.Strong wage growth complicates the Fed’s mission to bring down price increases because higher labor costs could put upward pressure on inflation.When wages go up, that’s good news for consumer spending and the economy. But for the Fed, it’s a roadblock, noted Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.“The more stubborn the resilience in job and wage gains, the longer the Fed will need to remain in a restrictive monetary stance, and the bigger the chance of an economic downturn at some point this year,” he wrote.For the first four months of the year, job growth has averaged 285,000 per month, more people are participating in the labor market, and job gains are occurring in even some of the most challenged sectors such as manufacturing and construction, Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese wrote in a note.But the storm clouds are gathering.“With each passing month, the tailwinds from efforts to restaff post-lockdowns are getting weaker, while the hiring headwinds from tighter monetary policy are getting stronger,” they wrote. “The jobs market remains on solid ground, but cracks are emerging. Jobless claims are ticking higher, job openings are rapidly declining, and temporary help employment fell once again in April, with the latter being a useful indicator of labor demand growth on the margin.”Plenty can happen and plenty of data will drop between now and the Fed’s next meeting, in June.Some important economic reports will be released next week, including the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Monday, which will provide some insight into lending conditions, and the key inflation gauges of the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index.Separately, President Joe Biden is expected to meet with congressional leaders to hold discussions about raising the debt ceiling.Not doing so would be “unprecedented,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week, adding that the consequences to the US economy could be highly uncertain and “quite averse.”— CNN’s Matt Egan and Bryan Mena contributed to this report.",business,0.0
125,130,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/business/april-jobs-report-final/index.html,"US labor market heats back up, adding 253,000 jobs in April",2023-05-05 16:29:00,"The US labor market that was poised for a spring cool just got a touch of heat.The economy added 253,000 jobs in April, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s a surprising increase at a time when many indicators were pointing to a slowdown in the job market.The unemployment rate fell to 3.4% — matching a 53-year low hit in January — from 3.5% the month before. The labor force participation rate held steady at 62.6%.Economists were expecting job growth to decline for the third consecutive month, 180,000 jobs to be added, and for the unemployment rate to increase to 3.6%, according to Refinitiv. Only three economists of the 87 polled by Refinitiv had projected job growth at or above 253,000.The net job gains seen in April represent a big jump from March’s tally, which was revised down to 165,000 from 236,000 jobs, BLS data shows. Some of the largest increases were in the sectors of private education and health services, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.“Payrolls came in better than expected, the unemployment rate fell, and wage growth reaccelerated; all of these data points show that the labor market remains on somewhat solid footing,” Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a statement. “While the [Federal Reserve] has laid the groundwork for a pause at the June meeting, additional strong economic data would keep them firmly on the side of a tightening bias.”In April, average hourly earnings trending up, rising 0.5% from the previous month and increasing to a 4.4% gain over the past year. In March, the monthly and annual measures of wage gains in the private sector was up 0.3% and 4.3%, respectively.Despite the upside surprise, the labor market does appear to be still slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth, Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN.February’s total was revised down as well — to 248,000 from 326,000 — resulting in average job growth of 222,000 for the past three months, BLS data shows. During the second half of last year, job growth averaged 353,000 per month.“So we are seeing a slowing in the labor market, and that’s good news from an inflation perspective,” Faucher said. “Businesses are still trying to hire, demand for labor is still strong, but it’s not quite as strong as it was even in late 2022. For businesses, it looks like they’re finding that perhaps it’s a little bit easier to find workers now.”That’s the case for one of the longest-operating businesses in Colorado.Brenda Fishman wears many hats at Lakeside Amusement Park, a 115-year-old family-owned landmark nestled in a tiny Colorado town near the northwest edge of Denver.On Thursday afternoon, she jumped in as switchboard operator when the phone rang.“The person who should be answering the phone, we haven’t been able find,” said Fishman, whose grandfather purchased Lakeside back in the 1930s.Fishman, who works in operations, has been poring through “hundreds and hundreds and hundreds” of job applications in recent weeks. Lakeside is gearing up for the summer season and its soft opening next week.“People need work,” she said. “People aren’t getting hired, and they want to work.”The number of applicants for this coming season is far greater than last year, she said.That would be a positive development for Lakeside, which last year resorted to limiting food options, closing games and shutting down some rides because of staffing shortages, she said.However, it’s not just the amount of people applying but also who’s applying for jobs that is putting a unique spin on this year’s hiring activities.Far more adults are vying for positions, she said, as well as people looking for a second job and people who previously worked in completely unrelated fields such as nursing, dental, and mid-level management.“This goes back to many, many decades ago when people were tightening their belts and saving up,” she said. “We did not see the same feeling when [the Great Recession] happened. This is more marked at the moment.”Nationally, the job gains would likely have been even higher if the labor market weren’t so supply-constrained, Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said in a note.The unemployment rate has been below 4% for more than a year, indicating a very tight labor market, she said.“Labor force participation was flat in April, holding hiring back,” she wrote. “With few people coming in off the sidelines, new jobs went to those actively seeking employment. As a result, Black and Hispanic unemployment continued to fall, with Black unemployment hitting a new all-time low [at 4.7%].”However, the job growth seen in April wasn’t fully broad-based, Gregory Daco, EY Parthenon chief economist, told CNN. He noted that the BLS’ diffusion index, which measures how many industries are adding jobs, measured 57.4% for last month, staying near a pre-pandemic low.“We are still seeing growth in some sectors, but we’re also seeing other sectors that are cutting back,” he said.Among those with net losses were wholesale trade and temporary health services.“The continued decline in temporary help services employment may start tripping some traditional recession alarm bells, but given the rapid pace of hiring in recent years, it may simply be another sign of moderation,” Nick Bunker, head of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, said in a statement. “Workers, employers, and policymakers should be encouraged about the current state of affairs, but it’s unclear how much longer it can endure.”Businesses in leisure and hospitality and health care — sectors that have wrangled with worker shortages during the recovery from the pandemic —have steadily added jobs and starting to find a better balance in the supply and demand equation, noted Patrick Combs, interim chief executive officer at the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership. The public workforce organization in Chicago recently hosted its sixth annual Hospitality Hires Chicago job fair, where dozens of the 300-plus attendees were offered jobs on the spot.“There was a much closer alignment to the number of people looking for work, and the number of employers looking to hire,” McCombs told CNN. “We’re definitely not at that place where we were six months to a year ago, where there was almost desperation on the side of hospitality employers to find people and where they were cutting hours or cutting down operations.He added: “It’s looking a lot healthier, I would say for that labor market.”The lion’s share of recent economic data pointed to a more pronounced softening in the labor market, which has been going gangbusters during the past three years to reclaim the 22 million jobs lost at the outset of the pandemic and grow beyond that.The BLS’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report for March showed that openings fell to the lowest level since May 2021, hiring was flat, quits dropped and layoffs spiked.The Challenger, Gray & Christmas read on layoff announcements showed that the January-April job cuts of 337,411 was the highest total for that period going back to 2009 (excluding 2020). And weekly jobless claims have slowly trended up in recent weeks, although they remain below historical averages.But one indicator warning of some potential heat came Wednesday, when payroll processor ADP released its monthly look at private-sector hiring and wage activity. ADP reported that private-sector employers added an estimated 296,000 jobs in April, crushing economists’ expectations for a gain of 148,000 and more than doubling the prior month’s tally of 142,000.A continued slowdown in job growth has been anticipated given the natural course of an employment recovery as well as the effects of the Fed’s interest rates and broader uncertainty around the banking sector.The persistent strength of the labor market, however, provides a sense of hope that a “soft landing” is still possible, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said this week, noting the path of bringing inflation down without an overwhelming rise in unemployment and subsequent recession.“This is what a soft landing would look like, with job growth gradually slowing to a more sustainable pace,” PNC’s Faucher said. “That being said, we won’t know whether we’ve achieved a soft landing probably until the end of this year.”And while a lot can happen and a lot of data will be released — including another jobs report — in the 40 days before the Fed’s next policymaking meeting, today’s hotter-than expected print could influence a more hawkish tilt from the central bank, which is weighing a pause after 10 straight rate hikes.“I think this is the type of report that is one that will keep the excessively data-dependent Fed on a tightening bias,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, said in an interview with CNN. “Unfortunately, the reality today is that excessive data dependence is a very risky proposition in such a volatile macro environment.”",business,0.0
126,131,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/economy/real-wages-inflation/index.html,Will wages outpace inflation for long? It depends on the job,2023-05-05 15:02:00,"Wages are now finally beating inflation, according to the latest quarterly data on wage growth. But, with a widely expected recession still looming, that might not last. That is, unless you work in a certain industry.In the first three months of the year, median weekly earnings for full-time and salaried workers were 6.1% higher compared to the same period a year ago, outpacing the 5.8% increase in consumer prices during that period. And Friday’s jobs report showed that workers’ paychecks grew in April by 16 cents, or 0.5%, to $33.36 an hour on average. That was the biggest monthly increase since March 2022, though wage growth had gradually slowed since then.Workers who switched jobs are still raking in higher wages than those who choose to stay; and employees in industries struggling to hire, such as leisure and hospitality, are also enjoying fatter paychecks, economists said.“The folks who left one company and went to another are the ones who are still benefiting from wage growth,” said Morgan Llewellyn, chief data scientist at Jobvite.Part of the continued strength in wage growth largely has to do with employers’ difficulty in hiring, which varies by industry. A recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business showed that 53% of small businesses reported “few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.” The report said that vacancies in construction, transportation and wholesale remain the hardest to fill.“This is still an incredibly tight labor market and employers are still having to beat out competition to secure talent,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. “And even if employers want to get back to normal and control wage growth, they just don’t have much choice but to raise wages to increase recruitment and retention.”Constrained labor supply might be a reason why employers are still having such a hard time hiring. Labor force participation, or the share of workers employed or seeking a job, stood at 62.6%, below 63.3% in February 2020, ahead of the pandemic. Participation among “prime age” workers, those between the ages of 25 and 54, has already made a full recovery, but it remains below pre-pandemic levels for workers in their early twenties and those older than 54.It could also be due to workers simply wanting other kinds of jobs, such as ones that pay more or allow for remote work, Pollak said.“Wage growth has still been higher for job changers than job stayers and that suggests that there’s still a shortage of labor for some companies,” said Dawn Fay, operational president at staffing firm Robert Half.Fay said that workers such as accountants, systems analysts and customer service professionals remain in demand and are still enjoying robust compensation packages, even from a year ago. She said she expects demand for those workers to persist even during an economic downturn because of their “core skill sets.”Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, expect the US economy to tilt into a recession later in the year. A recession is defined as a broad economic downturn that typically includes a weak jobs market. That means wage and payroll growth would slow considerably, but not for every worker.“If you think about a recession caused by rising interest rates, it won’t stop you from aging or needing a knee replacement, so there won’t be much of an impact on demand for health care,” said Llewellyn. “But it would have an effect on transportation, manufacturing, and other industries that are interest-rate sensitive.”Workers in the leisure and hospitality sector, which includes bars, restaurants and hotels, have also enjoyed some of the strongest wage gains. That’s because pent-up demand after pandemic lockdowns means consumers are still traveling at a strong clip. It’s also a sector that has been slow to bounce back after losing millions of workers in the first months of the pandemic — and now, many of those workers are reluctant to return to what they see as a low-pay, unstable work environment.If the economy heads into a recession and consumers cut back on discretionary spending like travel and dining out, that could potentially undo those wage gains in leisure and hospitality, Llewellyn said.Demand for health care might even become greater because of the country’s aging population, he said. Health care firms added 40,000 jobs in April and averaged a gain of about 47,000 jobs a month in the prior six months.Workers will also be less likely to switch jobs if there is a recession, thus weakening wage growth figures across the board, Llewellyn added.Still, the US labor market is still holding up, even as other data points to a slowing economy. Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, trouncing economists’ expectation, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, matching the lowest rate since 1969.At the same time, US economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.1% in the January-through-March period, a weaker rate than the prior two quarters; and a key measure of business investment, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, fell in three of the four months through March. The latest surveys released by the Institute for Supply Management showed that economic activity in the US manufacturing sector contracted for the sixth consecutive month in April.",business,0.0

Perhaps if I tell them that the footage came from a combination of WikiLeaks and Hunter Biden’s laptop, it will alleviate their concerns.”Carlson has not responded to CNN requests for comment about the footage.The watchdog group published a video clip on Wednesday showing Carlson speaking to colleagues on set between broadcasts candidly discussing the deposition he gave in Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation case against Fox. Carlson referred to a Dominion lawyer as a “slimy little motherf**ker” and confessed to his producer “the hate” that he felt for him.“I don’t want to feel that way. I think it’s wrong. It’s bad. It’s totally bad for you to feel that way,” Carlson said. “But that guy, he triggered the sh*t out of me.”The footage also showed Carlson trashing the right-wing network’s streaming service Fox Nation, expressing frustration that the platform “sucks” and complaining that its “unbelievable” shortcomings were a “betrayal” of his efforts.In other clips, Carlson is seen talking about sex ahead of an on-camera interview with Fox Nation host Piers Morgan, saying, “If we’re going to talk about sex, I’d love to hit some of the fine points of technique.”Others show him asking a makeup artist if “pillow fights ever break out” in the women’s bathroom, discussing his “postmenopausal fans” and describing a woman as “yummy.”",business,0.0

But you’d never know,2023-05-05 11:18:00,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, doesn’t want to be called a Chinese company.It was founded in Shanghai in 2017 but had to leave China just a few months later because of a major regulatory crackdown on the industry. Its origin story remains an albatross for the company, says CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ.“Our opposition in the West bends over backward to paint us as a ‘Chinese company,’” he wrote in a blog post last September. “In doing so, they don’t mean well.”Binance is one of several privately owned, consumer-focused companies that are distancing themselves from their roots in the world’s second largest economy even as they dominate their respective fields and reach new heights of international success.In recent months, PDD — the owner of online superstore Temu — has moved its headquarters nearly 6,000 miles to Ireland, while Shein, the fast fashion retailer, has moved to Singapore.The trend comes at a time of unprecedented scrutiny for Chinese businesses in the West. Experts say the treatment of companies such as TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has served as cautionary tales for businesses deciding how to position themselves abroad and has even led to the recruitment of foreign executives to help curry favor in certain markets.“Being [seen as] a Chinese company is potentially bad for doing global business and comes with a variety of risks,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“It may affect your image, it may affect how regulators around the world literally treat you and your access to credit, markets, partners, in some cases land, raw materials.”Temu, the online marketplace that has grown rapidly in the United States and Europe, casts itself as a US company owned by a multinational firm. The firm is Boston-based and its parent, PDD, lists its head office as Dublin. But it wasn’t always the case.Until earlier this year, PDD was headquartered in Shanghai and known as Pinduoduo, also the name of its hugely popular e-commerce platform in China. But in the last few months, the company changed its name and moved to the Irish capital, without providing an explanation.Shein, meanwhile, has long played down its origins.In 2021, as the online fast fashion giant gained popularity in the United States, its website did not mention its backstory, including the fact that it first launched in China. Nor did it say where it was based, stating only that it was an “international” firm.Another Shein corporate webpage, which has since been archived, lists frequently asked questions, including one about its headquarters. The company’s answer outlined “key operation centers in Singapore, China, the US and other major global markets,” without directly identifying its main hub.Now, its website clearly states Singapore as its headquarters, alongside “key operation centers in the US and other major global markets,” without mentioning China.As for Binance, there are questions about whether its lack of a physical global headquarters is a deliberate strategy to avoid regulation. In addition, the Financial Times reported in March that the firm had obscured its links to China for years, including the use of an office there until at least the end of 2019.In a statement this week, Binance told CNN that the company “does not operate in China, nor do we have any technology, including servers or data, based in China.”“While we did have a customer service call center based in China to service global Mandarin speakers, those employees who wished to remain with the company were offered relocation assistance starting in 2021,” a spokesperson said.PDD, Shein and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment on this story.It’s easy to see why companies are taking this approach.“When you talk about corporate entities that are seen as being in one way or another connected to China, you sort of start opening this can of worms,” said Ben Cavender, a Shanghai-based managing director of strategy consultancy China Market Research Group.“There’s almost this automatic take by the US government that these companies are potentially a risk,” because of the inference that they could share data with the Chinese government, or act in a nefarious capacity, he added.Huawei was the primary target of the political backlash a few years back. Now, consultants point to TikTok, and the ferocity with which it has been questioned by US lawmakers over its Chinese ownership and potential data security risks.The thinking goes that since the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, ByteDance and thus indirectly, TikTok, could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities, including possibly the transfer of data about its users. The same concern could, in theory, apply to any Chinese company.“I think downplaying their roots allows them to navigate these tensions and build relationships with US customers and regulators,” said Garrett Sheridan, CEO of corporate advisory firm Lotis Blue Consulting.“Against that backdrop, if you’re a Chinese entrepreneur and your goal is to maximize your access to consumers … it’s smart to try to make your company more multinational, more international and less kind of China-centric.”The risks for companies are rising as policymakers increasingly scrutinize whether a company is Chinese or has Chinese owners. Back in mainland China, a range of companies have faced regulatory pressure due to a yearslong crackdown, which seems now to be tapering off.As US-China geopolitical tension remains high, the American government has imposed restrictions on the sale of advanced technology, particularly semiconductors, to Chinese-linked firms.America’s allies in Europe have taken similar action, recently blocking two chip deals over their links with China.There is a risk of being stigmatized “even when they have a very remote linkage to China,” said Guoli Chen, professor of strategy at INSEAD business school.He noted that in 2020, India banned more than 200 mostly Chinese apps. The move was condemned by the Chinese government, which dismissed India’s grounds of protecting national security as “an excuse” to target businesses with Chinese ties.Binance’s Zhao also implied there could be prejudice at play. In his blog post, he pushed back on media descriptions of him as a “Chinese Canadian CEO,” saying: “I am a Canadian citizen, period.”“The inference is that because we have ethnically Chinese employees, and perhaps because I am ethnically Chinese, we are secretly in the pocket of the Chinese government,” Zhao wrote. “This is obviously not true.”There is a potential risk of “racism or general xenophobia” clouding some perceptions of Chinese-led companies, Cavender said.In 2020, former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi erroneously called Zoom",business,0.0

About the same time, so did Cicis and the owner of Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes. Operators cited occupancy restrictions, bans and health concerns. But now buffets are making a comeback.In March, visits to three leading buffets — Golden Corral, Cicis, and Pizza Ranch — were up 125% from January of 2021, according to data from Placer.ai, which tracks foot traffic at restaurants and stores.That figure outpaced the growth of visits to fast-casual chains and full-service restaurants during the period, according to Placer.“The higher quality concepts that stuck it out are reaping some rewards, like Golden Corral and Pizza Ranch,” said Jonathan Maze, the editor-in-chief at trade publication Restaurant Business Magazine.Golden Corral’s sales grew 14% last year from pre-pandemic levels, according to Nation’s Restaurant News.“People wanted the buffet back,” Golden Corral CEO Lance Trenary told the trade publication. The company plans to add up to 250 more Golden Corral buffets around the United States over the long run.Buffets are growing again in part due to financial strains on consumers.The median household income of Golden Corral, Cicis and Pizza Ranch customers is below the national average, according to Placer.Inflation has pushed more middle-class and lower-income customers to buffets, analysts say.“It shows that people are looking for value,” said R.J. Hottovy, the head of analytical research at Placer.The buffet comeback started in March 2022 as food prices began to climb, he said.Restaurant prices increased 8.5% in April from a year ago, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.That has forced customers to make trade-offs.More shoppers are also visiting dollar stores and buying at cheaper fast-food chains, including middle-income shoppers.Dollar General said last year that it has been attracting customers earning $100,000 a year in recent weeks. Inflation has pushed up prices for groceries and these shoppers have turned to Dollar General and others to try to save money.",business,0.0
132,137,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/tech/lemon8-tiktok/index.html,"Despite TikTok ban threat, influencers are flocking to a new app from its parent company",2023-05-05 09:38:00,"In the days after TikTok’s CEO was grilled by Congress for the first time, many TikTok users began posting about an alternative platform called Lemon8, sometimes with eerily similar language.Multiple creators described the app as being like “if Pinterest and Instagram had a baby, with TikTok’s algorithm.” Some compared it to TikTok circa 2020 and encouraged other influencers to join the app before it grows. They also asked followers to share their Lemon8 usernames in the comments.As it turned out, the app wasn’t just a random alternative to TikTok. Lemon8 is a social media platform launched in the United States earlier this year by TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance amid federal and state efforts to ban or restrict TikTok in the country over national security concerns.The similarities in the videos comparing the new service to Instagram and Pinterest, which were posted by both English and Spanish-speaking creators, raised questions about whether people were being paid to promote the new app on TikTok. But despite that speculation — and the mounting scrutiny on TikTok and ByteDance — a growing number of US users and influencers are now eagerly touting Lemon8, with its focus on photos and highly curated, informational or “aspirational” content.“We have to talk about TikTok’s new sister app,” a creator said in one such video.“I’ve seen a lot of bigger content creators that I love on it and promoting it on their Instagram stories, so I thought, ‘okay, it’s my time to hop on this bandwagon,’” said Melanie Cruz, who got her start creating content as a YouTube vlogger in high school around 2018. “I like that it’s something simple, it’s nothing too in your face … it’s not overwhelming.”Lemon8 has been downloaded just over one million times in the United States since it became available on US app stores in February, and had around half a million daily active US users last month, according to intelligence platform Apptopia.The early traction for Lemon8 hints at the whack-a-mole challenge lawmakers could face in reining in TikTok and other social media platforms. It also carries some hints of TikTok’s own rise, which was reportedly fueled in part by ByteDance spending heavily to advertise the service on rival platforms Facebook and Snapchat. This time, however, the best place to promote the next TikTok may be on TikTok itself.The New York Times reported last month that ByteDance had begun early marketing efforts for Lemon8 that included working with influencers. Now, some creators featured on Lemon8’s “for you” feed appear to be disclosing their work with the company using the hashtag #Lemon8Partner in their captions.A ByteDance company source said that Lemon8 is still in its early days and testing how to work with creators. They said ByteDance has not launched any formal marketing efforts for Lemon8, but in some cases has made deals to pay creators to post on the platform. However, they denied rumors that ByteDance had paid creators to promote the new app on TikTok.ByteDance has also recently listed open jobs for Lemon8 creator partnerships roles, according to postings viewed by CNN. “Lemon8 is a social media platform committed to building a diverse and inclusive community where people can discover new content and creators every day,” the job postings read.Lemon8’s photo-heavy focus marks a stark shift away from most of the major social apps that, following TikTok’s lead, have gone all-in on endlessly scrollable short-form videos in recent years.Lemon8’s homepage is a “for you” feed where users can scroll through content, similar to TikTok, but instead of videos, the feed is two columns of still images. When you click through to a post, it might be a single photo or a carousel of images. It’s also possible to post videos on the app, but they’re less popular.The app is heavily centered on beauty and lifestyle content — the “for you” page can be sorted into six categories including fashion, home and travel. Many of the posts feature lengthy captions, and users can also edit images to include text overlays. On top of similarities to Instagram and Pinterest, Lemon8 looks nearly identical to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu.Still, the app lacks some standard social platform features such as messaging and the option to tag other users in posts.A recent scroll through Lemon8’s “for you” page showed before-and-after photos of a botox treatment, a “no restrictions” day-long eating plan, book recommendations, black tie wedding attire tips and “10 recent girly Amazon buys I do NOT regret.”“It seems like people love it or hate it,” Madison Bravenec, a health coach and content creator, said of the app’s focus on aesthetics. But she added that the app’s targeted focus on certain types of content has made it easier to find a community that’s interested in the wellness content she likes to create, whereas the most popular posts on TikTok often have to appeal to a wider audience.Some creators say Lemon8 is filling a hole in the social media ecosystem that was left when Instagram moved to prioritize short-form video content in order to better compete with TikTok, frustrating many creators who joined the app for its original focus on photos.“We’re not videographers, we’re not the types of people who would like to change the ways we create content and communicate with others just because a platform is prioritizing one deliverable over the other,” said Can Ahtam, a professional photographer who joined Instagram more than a decade ago. “So all of us did feel the impact of reach being lower with the photos we were sharing [on Instagram].”Ahtam added: “If we were to compare them side-by-side right now, Lemon8 would have the upper hand in photos being shared.”Lemon8’s userbase remains a far cry from the 150 million users TikTok says it has in the United States.Still, in videos reviewing Lemon8, some creators have pondered whether the app could ultimately function as a replacement if TikTok were to get banned in the United States, preserving the content recommendation algorithm that helped make TikTok one of the country’s most popular apps and launched the careers of countless influencers.But if TikTok were to go down, Lemon8 would likely go with it, according to James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“The concern is still the same, which is that ByteDance is a Chinese company subject to Chinese law,” Lewis said. “If it collects [users’ personal] information, then you’ve got the same problem.”TikTok, for its part, has said that its app does not pose a risk to US users, and that the Chinese government has never asked for US user data.The practical ramifications for creators of a TikTok (and, perhaps by extension, Lemon8) ban — if one were enacted — would still likely be months away, if not more. Lewis said he doesn’t expect any nationwide legislation to be passed before the end of this year, and it would almost certainly face legal challenges that could drag out its implementation if it did.By launching a new app even with TikTok in the spotlight, “ByteDance clearly doesn’t feel like they’re at risk,” Lewis said. And many creators say they’re not necessarily worried either.Even if TikTok and Lemon8 were banned, Cruz said, “I already have a following on all the other platforms.”",business,0.0
133,138,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/business/jenny-craig-shutdown/index.html,Jenny Craig is going out of business,2023-05-05 08:05:00,"Jenny Craig, the weight-loss chain, has confirmed that it’s shutting down for good.“It’s with a heavy heart, we’re announcing the close of our business,” a note on its Facebook page late Thursday. “The last 40 years would not have been possible without you.”Uncertainty surrounding its future started last week on reports that the company was alerting employees of layoffs and “winding down physical operations” of its nearly 500 weight-loss centers in the United States and Canada. Roughly 1,000 people will be out of a job, according to NBC News.Jenny Craig hasn’t returned CNN’s request for comment. However, its website is no longer active and displays the same message from its Facebook page.Customers are being told that “all auto-delivery subscriptions have been canceled” and that “all coaching sessions, food orders and merchandise sales have ceased online and in corporate centers.”Jenny Craig’s program provided nutritionally balanced menus, including entrees, desserts and snacks, designed to help people lose weight. Bloomberg reported last week that the company has roughly $250 million of debt and is considering a bankruptcy filing if efforts to find a buyer for its assets failed.Named after its founder, the Jenny Craig business started when she couldn’t lose weight after giving birth to her second child. According to its website, she said working out at the gym alone “doesn’t lead to long-term weight loss.” She opened the first branded weight-loss center in 1983.Her advertisements were splashed all over the TV, featuring well-known celebrities like Valerie Bertinelli, Mariah Carey and Kirstie Alley. But there was controversy when the brand enlisted Monica Lewinsky for an ad. Craig told Larry King in 2001 that featuring her was a mistake.“She certainly lost weight, but unfortunately, people tended to focus more on who she was rather than her success on the program,” Craig said on “Larry King Live” about the Lewinsky ad.It’s the latest sign of major changes in the weight-loss industry, brought on by popular new prescription diabetes drugs such as Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus that can also be used to help people lose weight. These relatively new drugs work by stimulating the release of insulin, which helps lower blood sugar. They also slow the passage of food through the gut.The FDA approved Ozempic for the management of diabetes in 2017 and Wegovy for weight loss in 2021. Traditional weight-loss companies are scrambling to adjust.WeightWatchers, for example, is getting into the prescription weight-loss drug business. The company, now known as WW International, recently bought Sequence, a telehealth subscription service that connects patients with doctors who can prescribe weight-loss and diabetes drugs. The $106 million acquisition of Sequence will give WW a foothold into the growing market for prescription drugs to manage weight loss.Ozempic has gained popularity in part due to celebrities using it for weight loss. But there are many concerns with using diabetes drugs for weight loss, including high costs and shortages that are making it harder for people with diabetes to obtain the drugs.",health,0.0

135,140,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/business/delivery-workers-new-york-bathrooms-ebikes/index.html,How on-demand delivery services hobbled an American city,2023-05-05 07:06:00,"Accidents on sidewalks and intersections. Dangerously congested bike paths. Delivery workers with nowhere to pee. Exploding electric bikes and scooters.New York City is known for fast meals and easy access to everything, but its public spaces are being severely strained by the surge in on-demand deliveries, fueled by a pandemic boom in online orders and the rise of a new crop of ultra-fast delivery services.There are around 65,000 delivery workers on Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates and other apps who bike around the city’s five boroughs every day, pushing to bring impatient customers their meals as quickly as possible.But even the largest city in the country isn’t designed to handle the rise of online ordering and the influx of delivery workers.The lack of infrastructure for food delivery has created a new set of challenges for workers, pedestrians, residents and public officials. Lawmakers are taking action, with more bike lanes, new rules around bathroom access and an ongoing campaign to combat the risk of lithium-ion fires in electric bikes and scooters. But so far, it’s not been enough to keep up with the rapid growth.The city’s struggle to address these issues touches on a number of flash points, including the makeup of scarce public space, the rise of gig work, NIMBYism, safety concerns and the future of urban transportation.The way New York City handles these issues will shape the response in other major cities.“It’s an intersection of competing problems that no one place has authority over,” said Andrew Wolf, a research fellow at the Workplace Justice Lab at Rutgers University who studies the gig economy. “It’s a workers’ rights issue, but it’s also a transportation issue. And are the companies going to take more responsibility?”On-demand delivery workers, who are primarily low-income immigrants, are typically classified as independent contractors rather than employees of the apps or restaurants.The industry has been criticized for that freelance model as it means companies are not obligated to provide these workers with benefits such as overtime and paid sick leave. But it also means the companies are not required to ensure bathroom or rest stop access, provide charging stations for electric bikes, or provide bikes at all.The independent contractor model has left gaps in worker conditions, researchers and worker advocates say. Now, the city may be paying the price.“Before, when the workers worked for restaurants, they supplied bikes, bathrooms and rest areas,” Wolf said. “Now, companies have adopted the independent contractor model where they shift the burden to workers and the public.”Delivery app companies have opposed changes to this business model that would make them responsible for employing workers and providing them with a minimum wage and other benefits. This would increase their costs and could make it harder for them to stay in business, as many big name services have never turned a consistent profit. Companies, meanwhile, say their platforms offer flexible earning opportunities for workers that allow them to set their own schedules.That has left city officials to largely figure it out on their own.New York City has built more than 1,500 miles of bike lanes as it promotes different forms of transportation, but they are still clogged up with commuters and delivery workers, and accidents are frequent.An analysis by The City, a local news organization, found that complaints about cycling, scootering and even in-line skating occurring in unwanted locations have boomed from pre-pandemic levels. The bike lanes also are not designed for e-bikes racing at fast speeds.The city, which ranks 93rd in the nation when it comes to bathrooms per capita, with fewer than 1,200 public restrooms for its 8.5 million residents, has also taken some steps to address the shortage for couriers. But the progress has been limited, too.Joshua Wood, a courier for Uber Eats and DoorDash, often sits outside restaurants on the curb while he waits — unpaid — for an order, or seeks cover under scaffolding when it rains.When he needs to go to the bathroom, he says he sometimes gets turned away from restaurants, despite a local law passed in 2022 requiring them to give access to couriers if they pick up orders.“People view delivery workers as dirty, smelly and taking up too much space,” said Wood, a member of Workers Justice Project, an advocacy group for delivery workers in New York City. “They want us to be this invisible army that gets what they need done. They don’t want to pay attention to how the sausage gets made.”The most basic need delivery workers lack is bathroom access in restaurants or in public spaces, according to a 2021 report by the Workers’ Justice Project and The Worker Institute of Cornell University. The report included a survey of 500 app-based couriers doing deliveries in NYC, focus groups of workers, and individual interviews. Most of those surveyed reported that they have been denied bathroom use at restaurants.There’s been some movement to provide bathrooms and rest stops for delivery workers.New York City last year announced a $1 million investment to create hubs for delivery workers, turning empty spaces like vacant newsstands into rest areas and e-bike charging stations.But there has been opposition in some neighborhoods to the development of these hubs that has stalled their expansion. One New York City neighborhood voted against a proposed site.In February, Chick-fil-A opened a single temporary “Brake Room” for workers to stop by, open eight hours a day, six days a week. The pit stop had outlets where workers could charge their phones, couches, chairs and tables, and an indoor bike dock — although it banned e-bikes.The rest stop closed in April.There is also the growing challenge of electric bikes.An estimated 80% of delivery workers rely on e-bikes and motorbikes, according to Ligia Guallpa, director of the Workers Justice Project, an advocacy group. The growing dependency on e-bikes has been driven by demands on delivery workers, including faster delivery and bigger areas to cover.But there is a shortage of safe charging and storage infrastructure for e-bikes.Some of these bikes, powered by lithium-ion batteries, have caught fire when charging and caused deadly explosions. New York City has seen more than 63 fires and five deaths caused by lithium-ion batteries in 2023 so far. Fires related to lithium-ion batteries caused a total of six deaths in all of 2022.Online marketplaces, which some delivery workers may have turned to for more affordable options in the absence of company-provided options or subsidies, often make it hard to tell the origin of these products and the quality of their batteries.“E-bike fires are happening because of the lack of charging and parking stations and the lack of education” about e-bike safety, Guallpa said. “There is a shared responsibility from city government, corporations and consumers to ensure workers do this in a safe way.”New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ administration has announced initiatives here, including efforts to promote safe battery use and pilot programs for e-bike charging in parks, but it has echoed Guallpa’s point that the problem can only be fixed if the public and private sector work together.“This is a broad responsibility,” Meera Joshi, the city’s deputy mayor for operations, in March. “Agency partners, delivery apps, and labor partners must work together to ensure that this equipment critical to delivery worker’s livelihood does not take lives instead.”Some private companies are stepping up. Uber is funding a new program that aims to get electric bikes with non-certified lithium-ion batteries off New York City streets.The company said in April it will soon give the thousands of New York City delivery workers who use e-bikes the ability to trade-in their bikes for newer, safer models.Workers Justice Project has called for more to be done. The organization wants a “safety surcharge” fee on delivery orders for customers that would go toward funding bikes as well as charging and parking stations, and education campaigns around e-bike safety.Divya Subramanian, an associate director at NYU’s Center for Sustainable Business, supports a surcharge and, incentives to lower the cost of high-quality e-bikes, and more charging stations.“This is the kind of infrastructure we need for all citizens,” she said. “But delivery workers are on the front lines of this and it’s even more necessary for them.”",business,0.0

On Monday, he made headlines for leaving his role at Google, where he had worked for a decade, in order to speak openly about his growing concerns around the technology.In an interview Monday with the New York Times, which was first to report his move, Hinton said he was concerned about AI’s potential to eliminate jobs and create a world where many will “not be able to know what is true anymore.” He also pointed to the stunning pace of advancement, far beyond what he and others had anticipated.“If it gets to be much smarter than us, it will be very good at manipulation because it will have learned that from us, and there are very few examples of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing,” Hinton told Tapper on Tuesday.“It knows how to program so it’ll figure out ways of getting around restrictions we put on it. It’ll figure out ways of manipulating people to do what it wants.”Hinton is not the only tech leader to speak out with concerns over AI. A number of members of the community signed a letter in March calling for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.”The letter, published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit backed by Elon Musk, came just two weeks after OpenAI announced GPT-4, an even more powerful version of the technology that powers the viral chatbot ChatGPT. In early tests and a company demo, GPT-4 was used to draft lawsuits, pass standardized exams and build a working website from a hand-drawn sketch.Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who was one of the signatories on the letter, appeared on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, echoing concerns about its potential to spread misinformation.“Tricking is going to be a lot easier for those who want to trick you,” Wozniak told CNN. “We’re not really making any changes in that regard – we’re just assuming that the laws we have will take care of it.”Wozniak also said “some type” of regulation is probably needed.Hinton, for his part, told CNN he did not sign the petition. “I don’t think we can stop the progress,” he said. “I didn’t sign the petition saying we should stop working on AI because if people in America stop, people in China wouldn’t.”But he confessed to not having a clear answer for what to do instead.“It’s not clear to me that we can solve this problem,” Hinton told Tapper. “I believe we should put a big effort into thinking about ways to solve the problem. I don’t have a solution at present.”",business,0.0

In some cases, people who baited the new Bing were subject to some emotionally reactive and aggressive responses.“We’re getting better at speed, we’re getting better at accuracy … but we are on a never-ending quest to make things better and better,” Yusuf Mehdi, a VP at Microsoft overseeing its AI initiatives, told CNN on Wednesday.Bing now gets more than 100 million daily active users each day, a significant uptick in the past few months, according to Mehdi. Google, which has long dominated the market, is also adding similar AI features to its search engine.In February, Microsoft showed off how its revamped search engine could write summaries of search results, chat with users to answer additional questions about a query and write emails or other compositions based on the results.At a press event in New York City on Wednesday, the company shared an early look at some updates, including the ability to ask questions with pictures, access chat history so the chatbot remembers its rapport with users, and export responses to Microsoft Word. Users can also personalize the tone and style of the chatbot’s responses, selecting from a lengthier, creative reply to something that’s shorter and to the point.The wave of attention in recent months around ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI with financial backing from Microsoft, helped renew an arms race among tech companies to deploy similar AI tools in their products. OpenAI, Microsoft and Google are at the forefront of this trend, but IBM, Amazon, Baidu and Tencent are working on similar technologies. A long list of startups are also developing AI writing assistants and image generators.Beyond adding AI features to search, Microsoft has said it plans to bring ChatGPT technology to its core productivity tools, including Word, Excel and Outlook, with the potential to change the way we work. The decision to add generative AI features to Bing could be particularly risky, however, given how much people rely on search engines for accurate and reliable information.Microsoft’s moves also come amid heightened scrutiny on the rapid pace of advancement in AI technology. In March, some of the biggest names in tech, including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.”Mehdi said he doesn’t believe the AI industry is moving too fast and suggested the calls for a pause aren’t particularly helpful.“Some people think we should pause development for six months but I’m not sure that fixes anything or improves or moves things along,” he said. “But I understand where it’s coming from concern wise.”He added: “The only way to really build this technology well is to do it out in the open in the public so we can have conversations about it.”",business,0.0
139,144,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/27/tech/snapchat-my-ai-concerns-wellness/index.html,Snapchat’s new AI chatbot is already raising alarms among teens and parents,"09:36 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Less than a few hours after Snapchat rolled out its My AI chatbot to all users last week, Lyndsi Lee, a mother from East Prairie, Missouri, told her 13-year-old daughter to stay away from the feature.“It’s a temporary solution until I know more about it and can set some healthy boundaries and guidelines,” said Lee, who works at a software company. She worries about how My AI presents itself to young users like her daughter on Snapchat.The feature is powered by the viral AI chatbot tool ChatGPT – and like ChatGPT, it can offer recommendations, answer questions and converse with users. But Snapchat’s version has some key differences: Users can customize the chatbot’s name, design a custom Bitmoji avatar for it, and bring it into conversations with friends.The net effect is that conversing with Snapchat’s chatbot may feel less transactional than visiting ChatGPT’s website. It also may be less clear you’re talking to a computer.“I don’t think I’m prepared to know how to teach my kid how to emotionally separate humans and machines when they essentially look the same from her point of view,” Lee said. “I just think there is a really clear line [Snapchat] is crossing.”The new tool is facing backlash not only from parents but also from some Snapchat users who are bombarding the app with bad reviews in the app store and criticisms on social media over privacy concerns, “creepy” exchanges and an inability to remove the feature from their chat feed unless they pay for a premium subscription.While some may find value in the tool, the mixed reactions hint at the risks companies face in rolling out new generative AI technology to their products, and particularly in products like Snapchat, whose users skew younger.Snapchat was an early launch partner when OpenAI opened up access to ChatGPT to third-party businesses, with many more expected to follow. Almost overnight, Snapchat has forced some families and lawmakers to reckon with questions that may have seemed theoretical only months ago.In a letter to the CEOs of Snap and other tech companies last month, weeks after My AI was released to Snap’s subscription customers, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet raised concerns about the interactions the chatbot was having with younger users. In particular, he cited reports that it can provide kids with suggestions for how to lie to their parents.“These examples would be disturbing for any social media platform, but they are especially troubling for Snapchat, which almost 60 percent of American teenagers use,” Bennet wrote. “Although Snap concedes My AI is ‘experimental,’ it has nevertheless rushed to enroll American kids and adolescents in its social experiment.”In a blog post last week, the company said: “My AI is far from perfect but we’ve made a lot of progress.”In the days since its formal launch, Snapchat users have been vocal about their concerns. One user called his interaction “terrifying” after he said it lied about not knowing where the user was located. After the user lightened the conversation, he said the chatbot accurately revealed he lived in Colorado.In another TikTok video with more than 1.5 million views, a user named Ariel recorded a song with an intro, chorus and piano chords written by My AI about what it’s like to be a chatbot. When she sent the recorded song back, she said the chatbot denied its involvement with the reply: “I’m sorry, but as an AI language model, I don’t write songs.” Ariel called the exchange “creepy.”Other users shared concerns about how the tool understands, interacts with and collects information from photos. “I snapped a picture … and it said ‘nice shoes’ and asked who the people [were] in the photo,” a Snapchat user wrote on Facebook.Snapchat told CNN it continues to improve My AI based on community feedback and is working to establish more guardrails to keep its users safe. The company also said that similar to its other tools, users don’t have to interact with My AI if they don’t want to.It’s not possible to remove My AI from chat feeds, however, unless a user subscribes to its monthly premium service, Snapchat+. Some teens say they have opted to pay the $3.99 Snapchat+ fee to turn off the tool before promptly canceling the service.But not all users dislike the feature.One user wrote on Facebook that she’s been asking My AI for homework help. “It gets all of the questions right.” Another noted she’s leaned on it for comfort and advice. “I love my little pocket, bestie!” she wrote. “You can change the Bitmoji [avatar] for it and surprisingly it offers really great advice to some real life situations. … I love the support it gives.”ChatGPT, which is trained on vast troves of data online, has previously come under fire for spreading inaccurate information, responding to users in ways they might find inappropriate and enabling students to cheat. But Snapchat’s integration of the tool risks heightening some of these issues, and adding new ones.Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist in New York City, said the parents of some of her patients have expressed concern about how their teenager could interact with Snapchat’s tool. There’s also concern around chatbots giving advice and about mental health because AI tools can reinforce someone’s confirmation bias, making it easier for users to seek out interactions that confirm their unhelpful beliefs.“If a teen is in a negative mood and does not have the awareness desire to feel better, they may seek out a conversation with a chatbot that they know will make them feel worse,” she said. “Over time, having interactions like these can erode a teens’ sense of worth, despite their knowing that they are really talking to a bot. In an emotional state of mind, it becomes less possible for an individual to consider this type of logic.”For now, the onus is on parents to start meaningful conversations with their teens about best practices for communicating with AI, especially as the tools start to show up in more popular apps and services.Sinead Bovell, the founder of WAYE, a startup that helps prepare youth for future with advanced technologies, said parents need to make it very clear “chatbots are not your friend.”“They’re also not your therapists or a trusted adviser, and anyone interacting with them needs to be very cautious, especially teenagers who may be more susceptible to believing what they say,” she said.“Parents should be talking to their kids now about how they shouldn’t share anything personal with a chatbot that they would a friend – even though from a user design perspective, the chatbot exists in the same corner of Snapchat.”She added that federal regulation that would require companies to abide by specific protocols is also needed to keep up the rapid pace of AI advancement.",business,0.0
140,145,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/tech/white-house-ai-plan/index.html,Biden administration unveils an AI plan ahead of meeting with tech CEOs,2023-05-05 10:00:00,"The White House on Thursday announced a series of measures to address the challenges of artificial intelligence, driven by the sudden popularity of tools such as ChatGPT and amid rising concerns about the technology’s potential risks for discrimination, misinformation and privacy.The US government plans to introduce policies that shape how federal agencies procure and use AI systems, the White House said. The step could significantly influence the market for AI products and control how Americans interact with AI on government websites, at security checkpoints and in other settings.The National Science Foundation will also spend $140 million to promote research and development in AI, the White House added. The funds will be used to create research centers that seek to apply AI to issues such as climate change, agriculture and public health, according to the administration.The plan came the same day that Vice President Kamala Harris and other administration officials met with the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT-creator OpenAI and Anthropic to emphasize the importance of ethical and responsible AI development. And it coincides with a UK government inquiry launched Thursday into the risks and benefits of AI.“Tech companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure, and that they protect people’s rights before they’re deployed or made public,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters on a conference call ahead of the meeting.Officials on the call cited a range of risks the public faces in the widespread adoption of AI tools, including the possible use of AI-created deepfakes and misinformation that could undermine the democratic process. Job losses linked to rising automation, biased algorithmic decision-making, physical dangers arising from autonomous vehicles and the threat of AI-powered malicious hackers are also on the White House’s list of concerns.As Thursday’s meeting was underway, President Joe Biden stopped by for a surprise visit, a person familiar with the situation told CNN. A White House official said Biden has been briefed extensively on ChatGPT and has even tested it out himself.In a readout following the meeting, the White House said Biden and Harris “were clear that in order to realize the benefits that might come from advances in AI, it is imperative to mitigate both the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security.”Biden “underscored that companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe and secure before they are deployed or made public,” according to the White House.Harris, meanwhile, reminded the companies they have an “ethical, moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products,” and that they will be held accountable under existing US laws, according to a White House statement on the meeting.Harris also teased the possibility of additional future regulation of the rapidly evolving industry.“Government, private companies, and others in society must tackle these challenges together,” Harris said in a statement. “President Biden and I are committed to doing our part — including by advancing potential new regulations and supporting new legislation — so that everyone can safely benefit from technological innovations.”Speaking to reporters following the meeting, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the conversation as “honest” and “frank.”“We had four CEOs here meeting with the vice president and the president,” she said. “That shows how seriously we take it.”Jean-Pierre said greater transparency from AI companies, including giving the public the ability to assess and evaluate their products, will be crucial to ensuring AI systems are safe and trustworthy.One company that has invested heavily in AI and that was noticeably absent from Thursday’s meeting was Meta, Facebook’s parent. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has described AI development as the company’s “single largest investment” and has said the technology will be integrated into all of its products. But it currently does not offer a ChatGPT-like tool among its services.An administration official told CNN Thursday that Meta was not invited to the CEO summit. “It was focused on companies currently leading in the space,” the official told CNN, “especially on the consumer-facing product side.”Meta declined to comment on the matter.The meeting marked the latest example of the federal government acknowledging concerns from the rapid development and deployment of new AI tools, and trying to find ways to address some of the risks.Testifying before Congress, members of the Federal Trade Commission have argued AI could “turbocharge” fraud and scams. Its chair, Lina Khan, wrote in a New York Times op-ed this week that the US government has ample existing legal authority to regulate AI by leaning on its mandate to protect consumers and competition.Last year, the Biden administration unveiled a proposal for an AI Bill of Rights calling for developers to respect the principles of privacy, safety and equal rights as they create new AI tools.Earlier this year, the Commerce Department released voluntary risk management guidelines for AI that it said could help organizations and businesses “govern, map, measure and manage” the potential dangers in each part of the development cycle. In April, the Department also said it is seeking public input on the best policies for regulating AI, including through audits and industry self-regulation.The US government isn’t alone in seeking to shape AI development. European officials anticipate hammering out AI legislation as soon as this year that could have major implications for AI companies around the world.– CNN’s Donald Judd, Arlette Saenz and Donie O’Sullivan contributed to this report.",business,0.0
141,146,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/tech/writers-strike-ai/index.html,TV and film writers are fighting to save their jobs from AI. They won’t be the last,2023-05-04 17:28:00,"By any standard, John August is a successful screenwriter. He’s written such films as “Big Fish,” “Charlie’s Angels” and “Go.” But even he is concerned about the impact AI could have on his work.A powerful new crop of AI tools, trained on vast troves of data online, can now generate essays, song lyrics and other written work in response to user prompts. While there are clearly limits for how well AI tools can produce compelling creative stories, these tools are only getting more advanced, putting writers like August on guard.“Screenwriters are concerned about our scripts being the feeder material that is going into these systems to generate other scripts, treatments, and write story ideas,” August, a Writers Guild of America (WGA) committee member, told CNN. “The work that we do can’t be replaced by these systems.”August is one of the more than 11,000 members of the WGA who went on strike Tuesday morning, bringing an immediate halt to the production of some television shows and possibly delaying the start of new seasons of others later this year.WGA is demanding a host of changes from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), from an increase in pay to receiving clear guidelines around working with streaming services. But as part of their demands, the WGA is also fighting to protect their livelihoods from AI.In a proposal published on WGA’s website this week, the labor union said AI should be regulated so it “can’t write or rewrite literary material, can’t be used as source material” and that writers’ work “can’t be used to train AI.”August said the AI demand “was one of the last things” added to the WGA list, but that it’s “clearly an issue writers are concerned about” and need to address now rather than when their contact is up again in three years. By then, he said, “it may be too late.”WGA said the proposal was rejected by AMPTP, which countered by offering annual meetings to discuss advancements in the technology. August said AMPTP’s response shows they want to keep their options open.In a document sent to CNN responding to some of WGA’s asks, AMPTP said it values the work of creatives and “the best stories are original, insightful and often come from people’s own experiences.”“AI raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone,” it wrote. “Writers want to be able to use this technology as part of their creative process, without changing how credits are determined, which is complicated given AI material can’t be copyrighted. So it’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing.”It added that the current WGA agreement defines a “writer” as a “person,” and said “AI-generated material would not be eligible for writing credit.”The writers’ attempt at bargaining over AI is perhaps the most high-profile labor battle yet to address concerns about the cutting-edge technology that has captivated the world’s attention in the six months since the public release of ChatGPT.Goldman Sachs economists estimate that as many as 300 million full-job jobs globally could be automated in some way by the newest wave of AI. White-collar workers, including those in administrative and legal roles, are expected to be the most affected. And the impact may hit sooner than some think: IBM’s CEO recently suggested AI could eliminate the need for thousands of jobs at his company alone in the next five years.David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment, said screenwriters want clear guidelines around AI because “they can see the writing on the wall.”“AI is already displacing human labor in many other areas of content creation—copywriting, journalism, SEO writing, and so on,” he said. “The WGA is simply trying to get out-in-front of and to protect their members against … ‘technological unemployment.’”While film and TV writers in Hollywood may currently be leading the charge, professionals in other industries will almost certainly be paying attention.“There’s certainly other industries that need to be paying close attention to this space,” said Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester Research who focuses on AI. He noted that digital artists, musicians, engineers, real estate professionals and customer service workers will all feel the impact of generative AI.“Watch this #WGA strike carefully,” Justine Bateman, a writer, director and former actress, wrote in a tweet shortly after the strike kicked off. “Understand that our fight is the same fight that is coming to your professional sector next: it’s the devaluing of human effort, skill, and talent in favor of automation and profits.”AI has had a place in Hollywood for years. In the 2018 “Marvel Avengers Infinity Wars” film, the face of Thanos – a character played by actor Josh Brolin – was created in part with the technology.Crowd and battle scenes in films including the “Lord of the Rings” and “Meg” have utilized AI, and the most recent Indiana Jones used it to make Harrison Ford’s character appear younger. It’s also been used for color correction, finding footage more quickly during post production and making improvements such as removing scratches and dust from footage.But AI in screenwriting is in its infancy. In March, a “South Park” episode called “Deep Learning,” was co-written by ChatGPT and the tool was highly focused on in the plot (the characters use ChatGPT to talk to girls and write school papers).August said writers are largely willing to play ball with tools, as long as they’re used as launching pads or for research and writers are still credited and utilized throughout the production process.“Screenwriters are not luddites, and we’ve been quick to use new technologies to help us tell our stories,” August said. “We went from typewriters to word processors happily and it increased productivity. …. But we don’t need a magical typewriter that types scripts all by itself.”Because large language models are trained on text that humans have written before, and find patterns in words and sentences to create responses to prompts, concerns around intellectual property exist, too. “It is entirely possible for a [chatbot] to generate a script in the style of a particular kind of filmmaker or scriptwriter without prior consent of the original artist or the Hollywood studio that holds the IP for that material,” Gunkel said.For example, one could prompt ChatGPT to generate a zombie apocalypse drama in the style of David Mamet. “Who should get credited for that?” August said. “What happens if we allow a producer or studio executive to come up with a treatment or pitch or something that looks like a screenplay that no writer has touched?”For now, the legal landscape remains very much unsettled on the matter, with regulations lagging behind the rapid pace of AI development. In early April, the Biden administration said it is seeking public comments on how to hold artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT accountable.“We can’t protect studios from their own bad choices,” August said. “We can only protect writers from abuses.”The strike, and the demands around AI specifically, come at a time when both the writers and the studios are feeling financial pain.Many of the businesses represented by AMPTP have seen drops in their stock price, prompting deep cost cutting, including layoffs. The need to manage costs, combined with addressing the fallout from the strike, might only make the companies feel more pressure to turn to AI for scriptwriting.“In the short term, this could be an effective way to circumvent the WGA strike, mainly because [large language models], which are considered property and not personnel, can be employed for this task without violating the picket line,” Gunkel said. Such an “experiment” could also show production studios whether it’s possible “to get by with less humans involved,” he said.But Joshua Glick, a visiting professor of film and electronic arts at Bard University, believes such a move would be ill-advised.“It would be a pretty aggressive and antagonistic move for studios to move forward with AI-generated scripts in terms of getting writers to come to the negotiating table because AI is such a crucial sticking point in the negotiations,” said Glick, who also co-created Deepfake: Unstable Evidence on Screen, an exhibition at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York.“At the same time, I think the result of those scripts would be pretty mediocre at best,” he said.However the studios react, the issue is unlikely to go away in Hollywood. Film and TV actors’ contracts are up in June, and many are worried about how their faces, bodies and voices will be impacted by AI, August said.“As writers, we don’t want tools to replace us but actors have the same concerns with AI, as do directors, editors and everyone else who does creative work in this industry,” he added.",business,0.0
142,147,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/media/movie-theaters-at-risk-writers-strike/index.html,"Movie theaters are most at risk if the writers’ strike drags on, Moody’s says",2023-05-04 15:33:00,"Already strained movie theater companies could be hurt most from the Writers Guild of America strike, according to an analysis released Thursday.The strike by film and TV writers entered its third day Thursday, with no negotiations currently scheduled with the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers, which represents management for big studios such as Disney, NBC Universal and CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.“New big-budget tent-pole releases tend to fill theaters,” said Moody’s in its new analysis. “Theaters rely on these volumes for food and beverage sales as well, so exhibitors could feel the effects of a protracted strike more significantly.”Broadcast and TV networks would be hurt too, as viewers would be left without their favorite shows move to streaming. The streaming services themselves would be affected least, since their libraries of content could carry them through a prolonged strike. They could even get a cash boost, as they did during the pandemic when production was halted, according to Moody’s.But movie theaters have already been reeling from pandemic closures and the rising popularity of of streaming.“Movie theaters have low credit ratings and less financial flexibility as compared to most studio and TV network owners, which makes them more vulnerable to a long strike. But in terms of the volume of content produced, television (networks and streamers) has more exposure,” said Moody’s.The WGA is striking against streamers and movie studios over pay, employment levels and the changing way in which shows and movies are distributed. The strike comes at the beginning of the spring writing season for fall shows.“Television will bear the brunt of a long strike as the implications of the writers’ strike will play out more noticeably for TV networks, stations, cable channels, and streamers. TV networks, particularly broadcast networks, consistently schedule new prime-time shows to begin in the fall,” the Moody’s analysis said.This will hurt broadcasters’ ability to attract audiences and, in turn, advertisers. All four broadcast networks are owned by major studios.“A quick settlement or a limited strike resolved in a month or two, in our view, would have a nominal impact on the financial health of the affected media companies,” according to Moody’s. “If a protracted strike occurs, and lasts six months or longer, it could hurt many media companies, especially smaller production companies.”Media companies that are well diversified — that is, if they offer sports, news, or have a strong content library — will weather the storm the best. But Moody’s warned that customers may eventually have to pay higher prices to help offset the strike’s impact.“We believe the strike will be temporary and unlikely to cause the investment grade issuers to see rating pressure in isolation, but it could cause some disruption and ultimately a settlement is highly likely to result in higher costs for all producers and distributors, and potentially for consumers, which could moderately impact subscription growth and churn rates,” said Moody’s.The WGA said its proposal to the studios would result in approximately $429 million per year for writers, while AMPTP’s offer is about $86 million per year. Moody’s estimated a new three-year contract would likely cost media companies an extra $250-$350 million a year.",business,0.0
143,148,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/business/writers-strike-analysis/index.html,"Cord cutting, streaming losses and the ‘terrifying math’ driving the writers strike",2023-05-03 14:21:00,"The structure and economics of the entertainment industry are changing ferociously fast. Nowhere is that more evident than on the picket lines of writers for television shows and movies that began Tuesday.The writers say they can’t afford to live under the current economics and pay structure of the industry, with fewer job opportunities on many shows and lower pay for many writers who do find work. There are many successful, even award-winning, writers who are finding themselves unable to make a living at the profession anymore.Studio management says they’re trying to offer a deal that is beneficial to both sides, but that they can’t afford to meet the demands of the Writers Guild for requirements to have minimum staffing levels and duration of employment when writers are hired.The union says management’s offer would transform the industry from one that uses primarily staff for its writing needs to one that offers primarily freelance writing positions.But less than two years ago the studios agreed to a lucrative deal with a different union, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), representing 63,000 production workers.That deal, which covered technicians, artisans and craftspeople who perform a wide variety of jobs other than writing, acting or directing, included large wage increases for some of the jobs, with immediate raises of as much as 30% to 50% for some of the lower-paid classifications.So why was management willing to pay whatever it took to avoid a strike then, but is poised for a long strike now? The sea change in the so-called “streaming wars.”Two years ago, the war between competing streaming services was all about subscriber growth, no matter the cost. Those services are seen as the future for media companies due to a steady and severe rise in cord cutting by many households cutting off the cable subscriber revenue stream that the media companies depended on for years.But the media companies’ streaming services are faced with competition from tech companies such as Amazon and Apple and that’s resulted in continued losses – outside of Netflix. Those are losses that Wall Street is unwilling to support.For media companies and some content providers, there are also contractual advantages to not having a quick settlement.So the streaming wars that had been all about subscriber growth are now all about cost cuts and future profitability.“Wars are brutal, painful and sometimes utterly pointless and the streaming wars may be no exception,” wrote analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson in a note six weeks ago. “Now that most media companies have moved away from driving streaming subscriber growth at all cost, we expect to see a rationalization of content spending in the years ahead and a shift towards …achieving streaming profitability.”The media companies with broadcast or cable channels are still making money on those. But with a steady annual drop of more than 5% to 6% of cable subscribers expected to continue, those revenue streams are expected to get smaller and smaller.Streaming is clearly the future, but an economically difficult one.“They have a long way to go to figure out how to make these profitable ventures. It’s very challenging,” said David Mumpower, a media expert, chief content officer of Mickeyblog and co-host of the “Streaming into the Void” podcast.“It’s a reinvention of television. But it’s terrifying math,” he said. And he said that math is falling squarely on some very successful writers who are making $2,000 a month, when they can find work.“These horror stories, they’re real. I know talented people struggling to make ends meet,” he said. “The Writers Guild is acutely aware that their leverage isn’t as strong as it was in previous strikes because the dynamics have changed. But long-term salaried employment [for members] isn’t assured unless they hold out now.”This isn’t the only labor battle coming up. Talks are due to start later this month for SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors, and the Director’s Guild.There’s little incentive for the studios to settle with the Writers Guild in the near term with those other talks looming. The shutdown in production is just another form of the cost-cutting efforts already underway.Even before the start of the strike, there had already been thousands of layoffs across media and tech companiesThe last Writers Guild strike in 2007-08 went for 100 days. If this strike goes on for six to eight weeks, it opens the door for the studios to cancel expensive deals they have with show creators that gave them exclusive rights to their shows over a set number of years.Many of those deals have proved to be too costly, and provisions of those contracts would allow the studios to opt out if production is halted over an extended period of time.“Around four to five years ago, the streamers and some studios did these deals in multi-million dollar range. There was a lot of irrational exuberance about the money that they’d be making,” said Jonathan Handel, an entertainment lawyer and writer and author of a book on the 2007-08 strike, “Hollywood on Strike!: An Industry at War in the Internet Age.”“The studios and streamers will find it to their advantage to use this strike to get out of those deals. So this will likely last until at least July,” he said.If the strike, or strikes, goes into late summer, it will likely push back the start of the traditional fall TV season, as well as the debut of new content on streaming services.Put another way: The streaming war, which delivered so many viewing choices to viewers in the past few years, is about to result in a lot less new content being available for much of the rest of this year.The key to how long the strike goes could be how long subscribers stay with multiple streaming services once they run out of new content. If viewers are satisfied watching the large selection of existing content the services offer, it could be a very long and very painful strike.",business,0.0

No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.”While union members would be on strike as of 3 am EDT Tuesday, the WGA tweeted that it would not set up picket lines until Tuesday afternoon.The Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers (AMPTP), which is negotiating on behalf of studio management, responded by saying it was willing to improve on its offer but was not willing to meet some of the union’s demands.“The primary sticking points are ‘mandatory staffing,’ and ‘duration of employment’ — Guild proposals that would require a company to staff a show with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time, whether needed or not,” said the statement from management’s negotiating committee.“Member companies remain united in their desire to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry, and to avoid hardship to the thousands of employees who depend upon the industry for their livelihoods.”The distance between the two sides suggested this could be the start of a long strike.

There were no talks scheduled Tuesday after the talks broke off more than three hours before the strike deadline Monday night, according AMPTP.Many shows on cable and broadcast networks have already filmed their final episodes for the current season, but viewers could see an impact with late night shows, daytime soap operas and shows such as “Saturday Night Live,” which could have early ends to their seasons.“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” will begin airing repeat episodes on Tuesday due to the film and TV writers’ strike, sources close to the programs told CNN.Show host Seth Meyers, who was on the picket line as a writer at SNL during the last strike, also prepared his viewers that Late Night with Seth Meyers won’t be on the air if there is a strike.The strike comes at a time when both sides say they are feeling financial pain.The multi-employer contract is between the WGA and AMPTP, which represents Amazon",business,0.0

At some of the biggest banks, savings rates are as low as 0.01%.But thanks to the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking campaign since mid-March of last year and competition for your money, you have many more lucrative options.Here are a few low-risk ways to make between 4% and 5% on your savings now.“We’re talking to all our clients about this,” said certified financial planner Natalie Colley, lead adviser at Francis Financial.You’ll always want to keep enough money in your checking account at a bank that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or at a similarly insured credit union) to pay your monthly bills and to perhaps cover a month of living expenses for emergencies.For the rest of your emergency fund and other savings, you can get a healthy return just by opening an online high-yield savings account at an FDIC insured online bank. Some are now paying between 4.35% and 4.8%.Some other entities are also offering FDIC-insured high-yield options, although there is a catch: To take advantage of them, you already have to be a customer of the company or a user of its products. The financial roboadvisor firm Betterment, for example, is offering 4.35% APY, while Apple is offering its users a 4.15% return.As with most bank rates, high-yield rates are variable so can change at any point. But since online banks are competing for deposits, they are likely to keep their rates higher than others.When you purchase an FDIC-insured bank certificate of deposit you agree to lock up your money for a period of time — anywhere from 1 month to 5 years. In exchange you get a guaranteed rate of return, which will be listed as the APY (Annual Percentage Yield).Some of the highest-paying CDs have 5% APYs and mature in anywhere from three months to two years.If you invest $10,000 in a six-month CD with a 5% APY, you’ll get your principal back plus nearly $247 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate’s CD calculator. A one-year CD will earn $500 in interest, while an 18-month term will generate $759.There are two ways to buy a CD. You can buy one directly from an FDIC-insured bank. But before you do, check what early withdrawal penalties there are in case you need to access your money before the CD matures, said certified financial planner Nick Holeman, Betterment’s director of financial planning.Or instead, you can buy “brokered” CDs through online brokerage platforms like eTrade, Schwab or Fidelity. They offer one-stop shopping to compare and contrast a broad universe of bank CDs at all maturity ranges.Buying brokered CDs also means you don’t have to set up new, individual accounts at different banks, but the CDs will still be FDIC-insured, assuming the banks sponsoring them are.And if you need access to your money early, you can sell it on the secondary market through the brokerage, although as with selling any investment there is no guarantee you will get back what you paid for it.Since CD rates tend to move in advance of the Federal Reserve’s anticipated rate moves — and the expectation is that it may refrain from further hikes — 5% yields may head south soon.“This could be the ‘last call’ for savers,” said Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst.“Yields on CD maturities longer than one year will start to slip shortly after it becomes clear the Fed is done raising rates and not just pausing,” McBride noted. “Now is the time to lock in those CDs as the 4% and higher yields will likely disappear in the second half of the year.”Shorter term CD maturities (i.e., under a year) will likely have a little more staying power, he said. But, he noted, “if the economy weakens noticeably, inflation drops meaningfully, or the Fed shifts stance and starts talking about cutting rates, this will be the catalyst for those yields to begin moving lower. Finding 4% yields will still be possible but the 5% yields will likely disappear by fall.”If you’re working with a financial planner or broker or are consulting with a fixed income specialist at your online brokerage, another investment option are Treasury bills, which mature in under a year.Of late, for instance, the 3-month and 6-month T-bills have annualized yields of around 5%. And unlike interest on CDs, which is fully taxable at the federal, state and local levels, earnings on a T-bill are usually exempt from state and local tax.So even if the yield on a CD may be a bit higher, on an after-tax basis the T-bill might net you more. “Don’t just look at the interest rate,” Holeman said.But again, T bills are not as straightforward as high-yield savings accounts or CDs. So working with a professional on this may be your best bet.As attractive as many savings rates are today, they are no substitute for the long-term returns you can earn in a diversified investment portfolio of stocks, bonds and other assets.Colley’s advice: Find one or two high-yield instruments for your current savings to lock in today’s attractive rates. “Keep it simple,” she said. “[But] don’t take money out of your portfolio to chase yield.”",business,0.0
146,151,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/success/mortgages-what-rising-interest-rates-mean-for-home-loans-tenth-hike/index.html,Your mortgage and home loans: What to do now that the Fed just raised rates again,2023-05-03 16:01:00,"After the Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate on Wednesday for the 10th consecutive time, those seeking a mortgage or looking to refinance their home are going to wonder just how much more they will end up paying for it.Good question.The 30-year fixed rate mortgage has run north of 6% all year.For the week ending April 27, it averaged 6.43%, up a bit from 6.39% the week before. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 5.10%.Mortgages aren’t tied directly to Fed rate decisions, but rather to movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, the benchmark rate for many consumer loans.As to where mortgage rates go next, look to inflation. If inflation keeps dropping, then mortgage rates are expected to drift lower too. But don’t expect them to go back to 3%.Meanwhile, the variable rate on a home equity line of credit or a fixed rate on a home equity loan will rise because their formulas are directly tied to the Fed’s rates.The average home equity loan rate was running at 7.94% as of April 26, well above the 6.4% recorded in mid-April last year.The average HELOC rate, meanwhile, hit 8%, about double where it was in mid-April last year, according to Bankrate.Whether rates on mortgages, home equity lines of credit and HELOCs rise or fall from here, securing a home loan may become tougher since banks, wanting to bolster their defenses against potential adverse events like a run on deposits, may want to take fewer risks and preserve more cash. One way to do that: make borrowing requirements more stringent.If you are close to buying a home or refinancing one, it may be a good idea to lock in the lowest fixed rate available to you.That said, “rushing into the purchase of a big-ticket item like a house or car that doesn’t fit in your budget is a recipe for trouble, regardless of what interest rates do in the future,” said Texas-based certified financial planner Lacy Rogers.If you are already a homeowner with a variable-rate home equity line of credit, and you used part of it for a home improvement project, you should ask your lender if it’s possible to fix the rate on your outstanding balance, effectively creating a fixed-rate home equity loan, suggested Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst.If that’s not possible, consider paying off that balance by taking out a HELOC with another lender, at a lower promotional rate, McBride said.",business,0.0

That means consumer debt — especially variable-rate credit card debt — will get more expensive.“The average credit card rate is now at a record high above 20%,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.More specifically, it was at 20.23% as of April 26. That’s well above the 16.3% average at the start of 2022.If you pay off your bill in full every month that is not a concern for you. But if you carry a balance, and especially if you only pay the minimum amount due, you will be shelling out more dollars every month just for interest, and it will take you longer to pay off what you owe.Expect to see your interest rate go up within a few statements.Your best bet is to try to find a good balance-transfer card with an initial 0% rate and make a plan to pay off what you owe in the coming months before a high rate kicks in.“Turbocharge your debt repayment efforts with a 0% balance transfer offer, some lasting as long as 21 months,” said McBride. “This insulates you from further rate hikes and gives you a runway to get the debt paid off once and for all.”But first find out what, if any, fees you will have to pay (such as a balance-transfer fee or annual fee), and what the penalties will be for late or missed payments during the zero-rate period.The best strategy is always to pay off as much of your existing balance as possible — on time every month — before the zero-rate period ends. Otherwise, any remaining balance will be subject to a new interest rate that could be higher than you had before, if rates continue to rise.If you can’t get a zero-rate balance card, your second best option might be a relatively low fixed-rate personal loan.The average personal loan rate was 10.82% as of April 26, according to Bankrate. But the best rate you can get will depend on your income, credit score and debt-to-income ratio. Right now, the current range of rates on offer runs from 6% to 36%.Bankrate’s advice: To get the best deal, ask a few lenders for quotes before filling out a loan application.",business,0.0
148,153,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/24/success/managers-employee-engagement-trust/index.html,Low employee engagement? Managers can help turn it around with this one habit,"09:36 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Employers who want a productive, engaged workforce could do more to train, develop and support those in their managerial ranks. That’s because managers are the secret sauce.Gallup’s Quarterly Workforce Indicator surveys consistently show that managers are a linchpin to employee engagement, retention, productivity and trust in leadership.As it turns out, effective training for managers is not a thing at many workplaces. “I would say 99% of employers don’t provide effective training — and I’m not exaggerating there,” said Ashley Herd, a former human resources executive who founded @ManagerMethod. “While some provide training, rarely is it effective [in providing] the guidance needed to help managers understand how to meet business goals while supporting employees in the right way,” she said.One key thing managers need to know is how to communicate well. In fact, how managers speak with employees — and how often — can go a long way to building employees’ trust and commitment, according to Gallup.Managers who already feel stretched thin may not be psyched to hear this, but one of Gallup’s surveys — which included responses from more than 67,000 US workers — found that the most effective way to make someone feel connected to an organization is to have a “meaningful” conversation every week with each direct report to discuss goals, customers and well-being as well as offer recognition. The recommended time to allot for each conversation: 15 to 30 minutes.Sounds like a lot. But if you have, say, a team of 10 people, you’re talking about walling off no more than 2.5 hours a week.“We find this single habit develops high-performance relationships more than any other single leadership activity,” Gallup researchers noted.The workplace research firm’s surveys have found that the ratio of engaged to actively disengaged US workers is 1.8-to-1 today, down from a record high of 2.7-to-1 in 2019.The purpose of regular check-ins, researchers noted, is to have “strengths-based conversations that bring clarity and purpose to work — which is now deteriorating in US organizations.”Helping employees to feel connected is especially critical in a hybrid work environment, which done right can itself also boost employee engagement, Gallup found.In a separate study, Gallup has found that employees feeling free to speak truthfully about the effects of big changes at work is one key way to build trust in leaders.“When employees strongly agree that they have had opportunities to provide honest feedback about organizational changes, they are 7.4 times as likely to have confidence in their leaders to successfully manage emerging challenges,” Gallup research noted.Herd offered a few recommendations for what employers can do to improve their development of managers. For starters, she said:Survey managers: Find out what training they are receiving, what training they would like to see and what they do that works well for their teams.Survey employees: Find out what support they are getting from their managers, and what they would like to see.Appoint someone to lead trainings: Name an internal learning and development contact or someone from HR to gather information on best practices from those surveys. Have that person then lead an internal training for managers and another one for employees about how to work with their managers. Ask a handful of participants in each to talk about the best practices they’ve used — and have different leaders talk about their styles (e.g., extrovert or introvert), how they found their voice and how they work with different personalities on their teams.Set baseline requirements for communications with employees. One might be for managers to regularly meet with direct reports and not cancel on them except in a true emergency or when the manager is on PTO. Have managers share their meeting agendas ahead of time with employees. That way the manager and employee can add items if they wish. Encourage managers to listen. “[Remind them to] ask questions of employees, rather than just talk themselves,” Herd said.",politics,0.0

150,155,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/media/ed-sheeran-verdict/index.html,Jury finds Ed Sheeran did not infringe on the copyright of ‘Let’s Get It On’,2023-05-04 16:03:00,"A Manhattan jury found Ed Sheeran’s hit “Thinking Out Loud” did not infringe on the copyright of the classic Marvin Gaye song “Let’s Get It On.”The jury determined that Sheeran did not wrongfully copy compositional elements or melodies from “Let’s Get It On.” The jury found that Sheeran independently created his song.Sheeran later said he is “obviously very happy with the outcome of the case,” adding “it looks like I’m not having to retire from my day job after all.”“But at the same time I’m unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all,” he said. Sheeran said eight years were spent talking about two songs with “dramatically” different lyrics melodies “and four chords which are also different and used by songwriters everyday all over the world.”Sheeran also delved into the emotional toll of the trial for him, noting that it required him to miss being with his family for his grandmother’s funeral in Ireland. “I will never get that time back,” he said.The trial concerned Sheeran’s song “Thinking Out Loud,” which won the 2016 Grammy award for song of the year. The family of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote “Let’s Get It On” with Gaye, had accused Sheeran of copying the 1973 hit.The plaintiffs had alleged similarities between the chord progression, harmonic rhythm, and certain melodies in the two songs. Sheeran’s legal team had argued that the melodies are different and the elements used in both songs are common in pop music.The case was closely watched for its potential to further complicate the legal landscape for songwriters, after a number of high-profile music copyright lawsuits in recent years.During the trial, Sheeran performed the opening line of “Thinking Out Loud” for the jury in an attempt to rebut the testimony of the plaintiff’s expert witness. Sheeran also said he found the allegations in the case “really insulting.”Sheeran testified that he and co-writer Amy Wadge wrote “Thinking Out Loud” in less than a day in February 2014 when Wadge was staying at his house in the UK.Sheeran said he and Wadge both had relatives who were ill or had recently died, and thinking about their long marriages served as inspiration for the song.Ben Crump, a lawyer representing the family of the co-writer for Gaye’s 1973 hit “Let’s Get It On,” said in his opening statement that Sheeran played his ballad and Gaye’s song back-to-back in a medley during a concert, and called the moment a “smoking gun.”During his testimony, Sheeran said the idea of creating the medley was “probably mine.” He said if he had, indeed, copied “Let’s Get It On,” then he “would’ve been an idiot to stand on stage in front of 20,000 people.”Music copyright lawsuits have become increasingly common in the music industry over the past few years.Gaye’s family has previously sued other artists for copyright infringement—and won. The estate successfully sued singer Robin Thicke and producer Pharrell Williams for $7.4 million in 2015 for borrowing from Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up” for their hit “Blurred Lines,” though the case turned into a five-year legal battle that ultimately saw the judgment reduced to $5.3 million. The ruling also awarded Gaye’s family 50% percent of the royalties from “Blurred Lines” moving forward.But other, recent copyright cases have had different outcomes.Taylor Swift faced a similar case in 2017 over her smash hit “Shake It Off,” which was settled and dismissed last year. Led Zeppelin was sued in 2014 over its iconic tune “Stairway to Heaven” by the estate of late Randy California, former lead guitarist of the 1960s band Spirit, for lifting part of their single “Taurus.” A 2020 appeals court ruled in Led Zeppelin’s favor.Sheeran, meanwhile, has faced previous legal battles over his music and won. In a 2022 case over his song “Shape of You,” a judge ruled in Sheeran’s favor that he did not copy grime artist Sami Switch’s song “Oh Why” after the musician accused Sheeran of plagiarizing a key part. He was also sued in 2016 over his single “Photograph,” which was settled out of court.After his successful 2022 legal battle, Sheeran posted a video to his Instagram voicing his concern over the recent wave of music copyright cases, calling it “really damaging to the songwriting industry.”On Thursday, Sheeran and Kathryn Townsend Griffin, a plaintiff in the case, hugged and spoke at length after the jury returned the verdict.“I’m glad that we could hug this thing out,” Griffin said after court. She added that Sheeran had invited her to one of his upcoming shows.– CNN’s Krystal Hur contributed to this report.",politics,0.0

We may receive a commission through our affiliate partners if you apply and are approved for a product, but our reporting is always independent and objective.The Citi ThankYou Rewards program has evolved over the past decade and is now a formidable competitor with established programs like American Express Membership Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards. Citi’s got a relatively small portfolio of quality credit cards and a rewarding program to boot. In fact, its credit cards offer some of the most generous category bonuses in exchange for reasonable annual fees.When it comes to redeeming your hard-earned points, Citi has an impressive transfer partner list that makes it possible to maximize your rewards for travel bookings. And if you don’t want to learn the ins and outs of various loyalty programs, Citi also gives you the option to use points for statement credits and direct travel bookings.If you’re curious about how the Citi ThankYou program works, here’s everything you need to know about how to get the most out of the program for travel.You can earn Citi ThankYou points in numerous ways. The easiest is through credit card sign-up bonuses, which range depending on the card. But that’s not the only way to earn points in this program. Between checking account bonuses and authorized user incentives, there are many ways to earn ThankYou points beyond credit cards.Citi has a small but mighty credit card lineup, offering generous welcome bonuses and ongoing rewards. The issuer’s credit cards are generally split into two categories: traditional ThankYou points-earning cards and cash back cards. However, recently, Citi made a change to its program that now sees its cash back credit cards earning ThankYou Rewards points, which can also be redeemed for traditional cash back.Citi has two cards that earn ThankYou points directly. These cards are ideal for maximizing rewards on everyday purchases, with the Citi Premier® Card and Citi Rewards+® Card specifically offering significant bonuses in those everyday categories.As mentioned, there are also a number of other traditional cash back credit cards in the Citi portfolio that allow you to boost your earnings. They can be incredibly valuable, considering the Citi® Double Cash Card earns 2% on everything. By adding this card to your wallet, you’ll earn a minimum of 2 ThankYou points per dollar spent on all purchases that aren’t eligible for the bonus categories on the Citi Premier or Rewards+ cards.Considering Citi’s cash back cards have no annual fees, adding one to your wallet could make a lot of sense. You’ll enhance your point earning across the board without additional annual fees.By combining the Citi cards you have in your wallet, you can maximize your earnings and ensure you continue to work your way toward your next redemption.Adding an authorized user can help you earn more Citi points in two ways: bonus points for adding someone and for all of their purchases. First, you’ll sometimes get bonus points just for adding someone to your account. Citi frequently sends out authorized user bonuses to targeted card holders. These bonuses are typically around 2,500 bonus points but can vary.Secondly, you’ll earn Citi ThankYou points based on all the spending your authorized user puts on their card. Of course, you’ll only want to consider adding a member of your household or someone you trust to pay you back as an authorized user on your account. Authorized users can make charges on the credit card they’ve been added to but have no liability when it comes to paying the bill — that onus falls on you, the primary card holder.If you’d like to earn even more ThankYou points, you can do so with a checking account. That’s because Citi offers several checking accounts that earn ThankYou points as a benefit: The Citigold, Citi Priority, Citi Private Bank and Citibank Account. With these accounts, you can earn up to 1,600 points per month on everyday banking activities. The exact number of ThankYou points you’ll earn depends on your account type and qualifying activities. Generally, Citigold, Citi Priority and Citi Private Bank accounts earn the most points.Sharing points is a great way to consolidate existing points with a significant other or family member. Citi ThankYou is one of the few programs that allows members to share points free of charge. The only stipulation is that you can only share points with someone who has a Citi ThankYou card, and Citi Custom Cash card holders are not eligible.It’s worth noting that shared points expire 90 days after receipt. So you shouldn’t transfer points unless you or the person you’re sending them to has an immediate use for them. Also, note that you can’t send or receive more than 100,000 points per calendar year.Once you’ve earned a slew of Citi ThankYou points comes the fun part of redeeming them. And thankfully, Citi offers many different ways for you to redeem your ThankYou points. You’ll get the most bang for your buck by redeeming points for travel, though that’s certainly not the only option.Here’s a look at your Citi ThankYou travel redemption options and how they work.Transferring points will get you the most value from your Citi ThankYou points. Citi has 16 airline and hotel partners, most of which you can transfer points to at a 1-to-1 ratio — however, that ratio can vary. You can redeem them for stays at all-inclusive resorts, international business-class tickets, domestic award flights and more. But keep in mind that not all airline and hotel loyalty programs are equal.Ultimately, you’ll want to research which program will offer you the most in return, depending on what your travel plans are. Like with the Chase Ultimate Rewards program, Capital One miles and American Express Membership Rewards program, you’ll need to link your accounts with each of the transfer partners, and you’ll also need to search for award availability with the airline of your choice before transferring any points.If you’re interested in transferring your Citi ThankYou points to a travel partner, these are your 16 options as well as the transfer rate.By transferring Citi ThankYou points to partner airlines, you unlock the ability to travel for next to nothing — in most cases when redeeming travel rewards, you’ll just have to pay the taxes and fees on a ticket. As a result, points and miles open up the door for flying experiences that would otherwise be out of reach.Keep in mind that the most obvious airline choice may not always be your best option. Airlines typically have extensive alliance networks, allowing you to redeem points for partner airlines through their respective programs. For example, Delta Air Lines and Air France/KLM are both members of the SkyTeam alliance, meaning you can transfer your Citi ThankYou points to Flying Blue and redeem for flights operated by Delta Air Lines.Citi’s airline partners will get you the most value for your points, especially if you redeem them for business- and first-class travel. That being said, Citi’s airline partners offer several sweet spot awards. These heavily discounted awards will save you points on travel and make earning ThankYou points worthwhile. Some of these sweet spots awards that will get you maximum value for your ThankYou points include the following:Generally speaking, you’ll get the most value out of your Citi ThankYou points by transferring them to airline or hotel partners. But that may not always make sense for all card holders — and it’s not your only option.Citi ThankYou points are worth 1 cent each when you use them to book travel through the Citi ThankYou portal. That’s significantly less than the value you’ll get from transfer partner redemptions. While transferring points is the best way to maximize your ThankYou points, doing so isn’t always possible. If that’s the case — or if you’re not interested in researching award availability — redeeming at a fixed value for travel via the ThankYou portal is a decent option.Citi offers several fixed redemption options, ideal for folks who would rather leverage points for daily expenses than travel bookings. The value you can get from this option ranges from 0.5 cents to 1 cent per point. While redeeming points this way isn’t advisable, as you won’t get as much value out of each point, you should use them however they suit you best.For example, if you have no travel plans in the foreseeable future but mounting expenses at home, then redeeming your ThankYou points for mortgage or student loan payments might make sense. Here are some additional ways you can redeem your ThankYou points and the value you’ll get per point in each scenario:Generally speaking, if you’re looking to get the most value out of your Citi ThankYou points, your worst option is when redeeming for a fixed value (for example, for statement credits). However, if you’re willing to sacrifice the value of your points and instead want to save some cash, it could be a solid option. Ultimately, every card holder’s goals for their points will be different, but it’s good that you have options with ThankYou points.Citi ThankYou points are worth about 1.7 cents each when you redeem them for travel through transfer partners, according to frequent flyer website The Points Guy. The exact amount varies depending on the cabin and destination you’re flying to. Generally speaking, you’ll get the most value by redeeming points for international business- and first-class flights. While 1.7 cents per point isn’t guaranteed for all redemptions, it’s a number you should aim for if you want to redeem ThankYou points for maximum value.Aside from travel redemptions, you can use ThankYou points for mortgage payments, student loans or charitable contributions, and they’re worth 1 cent apiece. At 0.5 cents each when redeemed for statement credits or check by mail, you’ll get the lowest value when redeeming Citi points.Citi ThankYou points are an incredibly valuable currency and can help you meet your most aspirational travel goals. Whether you’re using points for domestic or international travel, Citi’s wide selection of transfer partners offers terrific redemption value. Between a good credit card selection, top-notch travel partners and flexibility in use, Citi ThankYou points are definitely worth adding to your points portfolio.Looking for a new travel credit card?

Since every credit card earns a different amount of points on your common category purchases, the bonus points earned might persuade you to get one credit card over another.Fortunately, there’s a credit card out there for every type of purchase. Whether you eat out a lot, travel often or spend a lot on fuel, there’s a card that will maximize your points, allowing you to earn the most rewards possible.You can also pick a card that works best for how you want to redeem your points. While some cardmembers are looking to jump on that next travel opportunity by increasing their travel rewards balance, others might prefer cash back. Meanwhile, some cards offer a mix of both, allowing you to pick the rewards that work best for your needs at the moment.Looking to maximize your rewards? Let’s check out some of the best credit card to use for all of your spend categories.While the cards listed here are some of our favorites for their respective categories, they might not be the best for your needs. Run the numbers and analyze your spending habits to see if the listed card is a fit for your wallet.When it comes to dining out, it’s hard to beat the American Express® Gold Card. The card earns 4 points per dollar spent at restaurants worldwide. And with frequent-flyer site The Points Guy valuing Amex Membership Reward points at 2 cents apiece, you’re effectively earning an 8% return at restaurants, including takeout and delivery.Not only will the card earn a high return on dining out, you’ll also earn the same 4 points per dollar spent at U.S. supermarkets (up to $25,000 per year in purchases, then 1x), 3 points per dollar spent for flights booked directly with airlines or at amextravel.com and 1 point per dollar spent on everything else.You can redeem Amex Membership Rewards points for travel, gift cards and statement credits. However, you’ll often get the best value from your points when you transfer them to one of Amex’s travel partners like Air Canada, British Airways or Delta Air Lines, among others.The card also offers up to $120 in dining credits annually. With this perk, you’ll receive up to $10 in statement credits each month when you use your card to pay at select merchants, including Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations (enrollment is required before you use this benefit).To help further offset the card’s $250 annual fee (see rates and fees), you’ll also receive up to $10 per month in Uber Cash, which can be used for either Uber rides in the U.S. or Uber Eats deliveries (enrollment required).If you’re able to maximize both of the dining and Uber Cash credits, that’ll ultimately leave you with just a meager $10 fee — all while earning 4 points per dollar spent on eating out.Learn more and apply now for the American Express Gold Card.Groceries can get expensive, but the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express will put a some cash back in your pocket. It offers an impressive 6% cash back as a statement credit at U.S. supermarkets for up to $6,000 in purchases per year (then 1% cash back after that).Additionally, the card offers 6% cash back on select U.S. streaming subscriptions, 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and on transit, then 1% cash back on all other purchases.While the Blue Cash Preferred carries a $95 annual fee (see rates and fees), the current offer includes a $0 introductory fee for the first year, giving you an entire year with the card to ensure it works for your needs. If your family averages at least $500 per month at U.S. supermarket purchases, the annual fee pays for itself.If you want to skip the annual fee, Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express might be a better fit. This no-annual-fee card (see rates and fees) earns 3% cash back at U.S supermarkets (up to $6,000 per year, then 1% cash back). If you spend less than about $3,166 in grocery purchases annually, you’re better off with the Blue Cash Everyday instead of the Blue Cash Preferred after the first year.Learn more and apply now for the Blue Cash Preferred.Learn more and apply now for Blue Cash Everyday.When it comes to earning points on travel, there’s no shortage of credit card options. But, to truly earn the most number of points on every single travel purchase you make, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® is your best bet. The points add up quickly and the travel benefits you receive are top-notch.The card earns 3 points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining, 10 points per dollar spent on Lyft rides (through March 2025) and 1 point per dollar on everything else. You can earn even more if you book travel trough Ultimate Rewards travel, too. Flights booked through the portal earn 5 points per dollar while hotel stays and rental cars earn 10 points per dollar.You have two options when it comes to redeeming points for travel. You can transfer your Chase Ultimate Reward points to 14 airline and hotel partners. Alternatively, you can use your points through Chase’s travel portal where points on the Sapphire Reserve are worth a fixed 1.5 cents a piece.The card comes has a $550 annual fee, but you’ll receive an annual $300 travel credit. This can be used towards any travel purchased paid for on the card, including Uber rides and public transit fare. This effectively will brings your annual fee down to a slightly more palatable $250.You’ll also receive a complimentary Priority Pass airport lounge membership and up to $100 in credits when you apply for either Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.The card also extends some of the best purchase protection and travel insurance benefits we’ve seen on any card. When you use your Sapphire Reserve card on eligible purchases, you are covered against damage or theft for 120 days from the time of purchase, and receive an additional year of coverage with a manufacturer’s warranty of three years or less.You’ll also receive primary rental car coverage, baggage delay and baggage lost insurance, trip cancellation/interruption insurance and trip delay protection. With trip delay protection, you’ll be reimbursed up to $500 per passenger for out of pocket incidentals if your flight is delayed for six-hours or more for a covered reason. You just have to pay for your flights (award taxes in the case of award tickets) with your Sapphire Reserve to be covered.Want to avoid the $550 annual fee? Consider the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. This card has a $95 annual fee but has less features than the Sapphire Reserve. For example, it earns just 2 points per dollar on travel and 5 points per dollar on Lyft (through March 2025) and doesn’t offer a travel statement credit. At the same time, it still earns 3 points per dollar on dining. Plus, cardmembers can redeem for travel through the Ultimate Rewards travel portal at 1.25 cents per point and transfer to the same travel partners.With the Chase Sapphire Reserve new members will earn 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in the first three months of opening an account. However, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is offering an increased sign up bonus where you’ll earn 80,000 bonus points after spending the same $4,000 in the first three months of account opening.Learn more and apply now for the Chase Sapphire Reserve.Learn more and apply now for the Chase Sapphire Preferred.The Citi Premier® Card is not only the first Citi credit card you should have in your wallet, but also one of the best when it comes to gas purchases.The card earns 3 Citi ThankYou points for every dollar spent at gas stations, on air travel, hotels, supermarkets and restaurants (including takeout), and 1 point per dollar for all other purchases. With ThankYou points worth 1.7 cents apiece, this is an impressive 5.1% return for filling up your car, as well as the other category bonus purchases.You can redeem Citi ThankYou points for cash back, gift cards, travel or transfer them to over a dozen airline partners. Although many of their travel partners are for international airlines, you can use many programs to book flights on domestic airlines. For example, you can transfer Citi ThankYou points to Avianca LifeMiles and book United Airlines flights.And right now, the Citi Premier is offering 60,000 bonus points to new card holders after you spend $4,000 on eligible purchases within the first three months after opening the account. Plus, with the current limited time welcome offer, new cardmembers will earn a total of 10 ThankYou points per dollar spent on hotel, car rentals and attractions (excluding air travel) booked through the Citi Travel portal through June 30, 2024.Unfortunately, the Citi Premier doesn’t offer much when it comes to protecting your trip, as it doesn’t offer any travel insurance coverage. This means you won’t have access to car rental insurance, trip cancellation and interruption protection, trip delay protection, baggage delay protection and more.Learn more and apply now for the Citi Premier Card.Finding a credit card that includes drugstores as a bonus category is a rarity, but fortunately, the Chase Freedom Flex℠ card resolves that problem by offering 3% cash back in this category.This no-annual-fee card also offers 5% on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 5% on Lyft rides (through March 2025) and 3% on dining at restaurants (including takeout and eligible delivery services). On a quarterly basis, the card also offers 5% cash back on rotating categories, up to $1,500 in purchases each quarter. As part of the welcome offer, you’ll also earn $200 cash back after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months.On the surface, it appears that the Freedom Flex only earns cash back, but you can access more redemption options if you pair it with a premium Ultimate Rewards card. Doing this lets you effectively turn your cash back into Ultimate Rewards which you can transfer to various airline and hotel transfer partners.Since the Freedom Flex is a World Elite Mastercard, you’ll also receive cell phone protection, Lyft credits, 5% rewards at Boxed for use on future purchases, a free ShopRunner membership and double VIP+ points for movie tickets purchased via the Fandango app Fandango.com.If you prefer a card where you don’t have to keep track of quarterly bonus categories, but you’ll receive the same heightened cash back at drugstores, then you’ll want to consider the Chase Freedom Unlimited® card instead.The Chase Freedom offers 3% cash back at drugstores, along with the same 5% on travel purchases through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 5% on Lyft rides (through March 2025) and 3% on dining at restaurants. And you’ll earn a fixed 1.5% cash back on all other purchases.The other difference between the two is that the Freedom Unlimited is a Visa — not a Mastercard Elite — which means you won’t receive some of the valuable benefits that come with the Freedom Flex, such as cell phone protection.Learn more and apply now for the Chase Freedom Unlimited.Earning rewards for paying your rent has been hard to come by, until now. With the Bilt Mastercard® you can earn 1 point for every dollar spent on your monthly rent, up to $100,000 in rent payments per year. You can even pay landlords that don’t accept credit card as a form of payment. Best of all, there’s no fee for paying your rent with this card.This no-annual-fee card (see rates and fees) also earns 3 points for every dollar you spend on dining (including food delivery services), 2 points per dollar on travel when booked directly with an airline, hotel, car rental or cruise company, up to 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.Just note you must use this card at least five times per statement period to earn points.Bilt currently partners with 11 different airline and hotel partners, which includes many big names like American Airlines and Hyatt. All partners transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio. Or, for the ultimate flexibility, you can use your points through Bilt’s travel booking site at a fixed 1.25 cents per point. This means if you have 10,000 Bilt points, they can be used towards $125 in travel purchases when booking through the portal.The Bilt Mastercard also offers many favorable benefits, such as cell phone insurance, purchase protection, rental car insurance, trip cancellation and delay coverage, Lyft credits, a three-month DashPass membership and Mastercard World Elite Concierge services (see rewards and benefits).Learn more and apply now for the Bilt Mastercard.The Citi® Double Cash Card is one of the best when it comes to earning cash back for your everyday purchases. With this no-annual-fee card, you don’t have to worry about category bonuses, and instead you’ll earn 2% cash back — 1% when you buy something and another 1% when you pay it off — on every purchase you make. There’s also no cap to the amount of cash back you can earn.This card is marketed as a cash back credit card, but you’re actually earning ThankYou points. While these points have limited travel redemption options, if paired with a premium Citi ThankYou card, such as the Citi Premier, you can  transfer your points earned with Citi Double Cash Card to all of Citi’s 16 partner airline and hotels.Another advantage of the Citi Double Cash is that it offers a relatively long 18-month introductory 0% APR for balance transfers — a great way to pay off your debt (though make sure you pay it off, because the APR jumps to a variable 18.74% to 28.74% after the introductory offer ends). And you have up to four months after you open the account to make your first balance transfer and still have it qualify for the introductory offer.However, the Citi Double Cash doesn’t offer many perks, such as travel or purchase protection. It also comes with a 3% foreign transaction fee, so it’s not the card you’ll want to bring while traveling overseas.Learn more and apply now for the Citi Double Cash Card.Click here for rates and fees of the Amex Gold CardClick here for rates and fees of the Blue Cash Preferred.﻿Click here for rates and fees of the Blue Cash EveryDay.Find out which cards CNN Underscored chose as our best credit cards currently available.Get all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money.",business,0.0

Visit americanexpress.com to learn more.While our choice for the best first travel rewards credit card has long been the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, if you’re already gotten that card or you’re unable to apply for Chase credit cards due to that issuer’s application rules, there’s a strong runner-up to consider: the Citi Premier® Card.Not only is the Citi Premier a solid contender in its own right, but if you’re interested in travel rewards, it potentially should be the first Citi card you apply for before considering any other Citi credit card. Yes, even our benchmark Citi® Double Cash Card.Why? Let’s dive into the Citi Premier and the application rules related to it so you can see firsthand why we think it should be at the top of your list when looking for a new Citi credit card.Right now, new Citi Premier card holders can earn 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months after opening the account. That’s the highest bonus you can currently get on any Citi credit card. Plus, with the current limited time welcome offer, new cardmembers will earn a total of 10 ThankYou points per dollar spent on hotel, car rentals and attractions (excluding air travel) booked through the Citi Travel portal through June 30, 2024.Exactly how much are those 60,000 points worth? Well, the Citi Premier earns points known as Citi ThankYou Rewards, which can be easily redeemed for gift cards or for any flight booked through Citi’s travel portal at a rate of 1 cent per point. That makes the card’s sign-up bonus worth $600 at a bare minimum, which is a great haul for a card that only has a $95 annual fee.However, with a little bit of effort, you can get even more value for your points than that. That’s because Citi also allows you to transfer your ThankYou points to any of its 16 partner loyalty programs, which now includes two hotel programs — Choice and Wyndham.While using your points this way requires some extra effort and flexibility, you can potentially get much more value for your rewards, especially if you redeem them for first or business class flights. That’s why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Citi ThankYou points at 1.7 cents apiece. At that rate, the 60,000 bonus points on the Citi Premier are worth $1,020 toward travel.Granted, there are some credit cards outside of Citi offering 100,000-point bonus offers or more, it’s important to keep in mind that not all points are created equal, and 100,000 points on some cards are worth less than the 60,000 points on the Citi Premier.Also, some cards require a ridiculous amount of spending to earn the entire sign-up bonus — as much as $15,000 in some cases. But the $4,000 spending requirement on the Citi Premier breaks down to just $1,333 a month for each of the first three months you have the card.Click here to get the 60,000-point sign-up bonus on the Citi Premier Card.Similar to most major banks, Citi has rules on how often a customer can be approved for a credit card. Although Citi doesn’t limit the number of cards you can open, it does have restrictions on how many cards you can apply for within a given time.Overall, you can only apply for one Citi credit card every eight days, and a maximum of two Citi cards every 65 days. That policy covers all of the issuer’s credit cards, including airline, travel rewards and cash back options.Seems pretty straightforward and easy to understand, right? Except that Citi also has a 24-month “card family” rule. This means if you’ve opened or closed any card within specific families of Citi cards in the past 24 months, you won’t be able to receive a sign-up bonus when applying for a new card from that same family.That rule is a little more complicated, so let’s look at it using the Citi Premier as an example. The Citi Premier earns Citi ThankYou points, making it part of the family of Citi cards that also earn ThankYou points, which includes the Citi Rewards+® Card and the no-longer-available Citi Prestige Card.So if you open a Citi Rewards+ card, you won’t be able to also get the sign-up bonus on the Citi Premier card until 24 months have elapsed. And since the Citi Premier offers a much higher sign-up bonus — four times as high as the Citi Rewards+ card — and better rewards, you’ll want to make sure to apply for the Citi Premier card first.The good news is our benchmark Citi Double Cash Card isn’t part of any Citi card family. So you can safely apply for it after you get the Citi Premier — as soon as eight days after if you want it that fast. And these two cards actually pair together very well, because if you have both, you can convert the cash back earned on your Citi Double Cash into points, and combine them with the points you earn on the Citi Premier, giving you one big pot of travel rewards.See if you qualify for the Citi Premier credit card.Compared to all of the other Citi credit cards, the Citi Premier has the most robust set of bonus categories. You’ll earn 3 points for every dollar you spend on air travel, hotels, gas stations, supermarkets and restaurants (including takeout), and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. Plus, there’s no limit to the number of points you can earn.This also brings up a second reason that the Citi Premier pairs well with the Citi Double Cash Card. Since the Citi Double Cash earns 2% cash back on everything you buy — 1% when you make a purchase, and another 1% when you pay it off — and you can convert your cash back to ThankYou points when you also have the Citi Premier, you can effectively maximize the rewards you’re earning on all your purchases by having both cards.How? Well, if you have both cards in your purse or wallet, you’d pull out the Citi Premier whenever you’re making a purchase in one of its bonus categories in order to earn 3 points per dollar, and then you’d pull out the Citi Double Cash Card for everything else to earn 2% cash back, which is effectively 2 points per dollar when you convert the cash back into ThankYou points. That way you’re always earning at least twice as much as the basic 1 point per dollar on everything you buy.The Citi Premier is also the only Citi card you can currently get that, on its own, allows you to transfer points to any of Citi’s 16 travel partners, potentially increasing the value of your points. All of the other Citi cards earn cash back or “basic” ThankYou points that can only be redeemed for gift cards or used through the Citi travel portal at 1 cent apiece.Citi ThankYou points transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio to all partners, which means the 60,000 points from the Citi Premier sign-up offer equals 60,000 points or miles in any of these 16 airline or hotel programs:Additionally, at times, Citi runs promotions for transfer bonuses of 10% to 30% when transferring your points to certain partners during certain time periods, which means you can get even more bang for your buck. The only rule when it comes to transferring points is that they must be transferred in blocks of 1,000, and no more than 50,000 points can be transferred at a given time.Citi also makes it incredibly easy to transfer points from one person’s ThankYou Rewards account to another. This is a great feature if you’re looking to combine points among friends or family members. But you need to make sure you’re ready to use your ThankYou points before you combine them with someone else, because points shared with another person expire 90 days from the date they’re received, and you can transfer a maximum of 100,000 ThankYou points in a calendar year.Get the Citi Premier and combine your cash back from other Citi credit cards.Both the Citi Premier and the Chase Sapphire Preferred have $95 annual fees, so they’re comparable in cost. With the Sapphire Preferred, you’ll earn Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which transfer to a different set of partners than Citi ThankYou points. Chase offers three hotel partners in addition to 11 airline partners, while Citi has more partnerships available but only two hotel partners.Chase also offers more domestic partner opportunities, such as United Airlines and Hyatt hotels, while Citi focuses on international carriers. But Citi partners with many airlines that don’t partner with anyone else, such as Turkish Airlines.The Chase Sapphire Preferred also offers many shopping and travel protection benefits. For example, if your flight is delayed overnight, causing you to have to fly out the following morning, the Sapphire Preferred will reimburse you for any unexpected out-of-pocket costs — such as a night at a hotel, food and taxis — up to $500 per passenger.While the Citi Premier no longer offers these nice-to-have perks, it does have more bonus categories, and in some cases at a higher rate. For instance, the Citi Premier earns 3 points per dollar on travel purchases, whereas the Chase Sapphire Preferred earns only 2 points per dollar unless you book through Ultimate Rewards.At the end of the day, they are both great credit cards that you’ll want to consider if you’re thinking about earning travel rewards for the first time. While the Chase Sapphire Preferred remains our favorite first travel credit card, the Citi Premier is an underrated contender, and should definitely be the first Citi card on your list. You can even apply for both and diversify your points — the ultimate way to ensure you have the right points when looking to go on your next much-needed vacation.Learn more and apply now for the Citi Premier card.Find out which cards CNN Underscored chose as our best travel credit cards currently available.Get all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money.",business,0.0
155,160,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html,Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.“The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.“The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.“This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.“A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora",business,0.0
156,161,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html,The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.“Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though.To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels.Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.",business,0.0
157,162,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/21/business/bereal-social-media-app-cec/index.html,This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram.There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.”  That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.“Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you.  (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.“What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.“I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.“I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.“It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.“BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,”  the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.“There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.“It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.“For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.“Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”",business,0.0
158,163,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/bmw-i7/index.html,"BMW reveals its new $120,000 electric flagship","09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan.While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries.The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.“There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists.Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night.For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times.The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode.A sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car.A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.",business,0.0
159,164,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/plane-airbus-cold-weather-testing/index.html,Cold weather testing: Airplanes endure punishing extremes,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","With extremely cold temperatures gripping much of the United States, travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying.The short answer: Along with regular deicing of planes before take-off, airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service.CNN has previously followed a team of Airbus engineers, mechanics and test pilots. Their mission was to see how their test plane, a long-range A350 XWB, withstood extreme cold.The Airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their Toulouse, France, base to perform various extreme-weather trials on the test plane in frigid Iqaluit, the capital of Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut.The ground and in-air tests included operating the A350 XWB in temperatures reaching down to  -18 Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius), thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test.All new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions, from freezing to intense heat.“Coming to an extreme place means we can break everything,” Airbus’ head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters.Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways. Metals, such as steel and aluminum, contract at different rates. Lubricants may lose their viscosity, creating friction and wear issues for moving parts. Meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle.The cold-weather tests in Canada came only days after the MSN3 test plane completed high-altitude test in Bolivia. Next stop was Qatar for hot-weather testing.For years Iqaluit, located on Baffin Island, has marketed itself as “a premier cold-weather test site.”Airbus has tested there since the 1990s, while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as Boeing, Dassault and Eurocopter to perform similar trials.But cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places.In April 2010, Boeing chose McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme-weather testing on its 787 Dreamliner.In a test chamber the aircraft was given a “cold soak” and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit (-42.7 degrees Celsius) for hours.Later, it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), also for hours.“These tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe (and in all seasons),” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a news release.But extreme-weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of Mother Nature.Initially scheduled for five days, Airbus’ tests in Iqaluit were cut short, not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees Celsius – too warm for the cold weather testing.",business,0.0

By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”",business,0.0
161,166,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/10/business/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-collapse/index.html,Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","In the space of a week, a 30-year-old entrepreneur once hailed as a modern-day J.P. Morgan watched his digital empire, including billions of his own fortune, evaporate in a death spiral that’s shaken the foundations of the trillion-dollar crypto industry.On Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried issued a mea culpa: “I f**ked up,” he wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread, apologizing to investors and customers of FTX, the exchange platform he founded in 2019. By Friday morning, FTX said Bankman-Fried had resigned as CEO and that the firm was filing for bankruptcy.Failures are not uncommon in the murky, largely unregulated world of crypto, but FTX is not your average crypto startup. Its near-collapse this week represents a potential turning point for an industry that many critics say has been given a pass for far too long.So, what happened to FTX, and why is the entire crypto space freaking out about it? There are still a lot of uncertainties, but here’s what we know.Last week, the crypto news website CoinDesk published an article based on a leaked financial document from Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research.The report suggested that Alameda’s business rested on shaky financial footing. Namely, that the bulk of its assets are held in FTT, a digital token minted by Alameda’s sister firm, FTX. That was a red flag for investors, as the companies were, on paper at least, separate. Alameda’s disproportionate holdings of the token, however, suggested the two were much more closely linked.On Sunday, the CEO of Binance, FTX’s much larger rival, said his company was liquidating $580 million worth of FTX holdings. That set off a firestorm of draw downs that FTX didn’t have the cash to facilitate.By Monday, concerns about Alameda and FTX had bled into the broader crypto market. But Bankman-Fried was defiant, tweeting that FTX and its assets were “fine.” He also sparred with the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, whose tweet had fueled the run on FTX deposits.There was clearly bad blood between the two, which is why it shocked the industry when the pair announced a tentative deal Tuesday for Binance to bail out FTX.“This afternoon, FTX asked for our help,” Zhao tweeted that afternoon, noting that there was a “significant liquidity crunch” at the company and that Binance would have to conduct corporate due diligence before going forward with any deal.Almost immediately after getting a look at under the hood, though, Binance began to backtrack.Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried’s personal fortune also tumbled. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Bankman-Fried’s net worth cratered 94% in a single day, from more than $15 billion to just under $1 billion — the biggest one-day loss ever clocked by the index. (The estimate of his wealth was based on the assumption that Binance would ultimately bail out FTX, where much of Bankman-Fried’s personal assets are held. Which means his net worth may have farther to fall.)On Wednesday, cryptocurrencies continued to slump as investor anxiety about the FTX bailout spread. Bitcoin and ether, the two most popular tokens, both hit their lowest level in two years.The selloff deepened after media reports emerged that Binance was leaning toward walking away from the deal. Sure enough, on Wednesday afternoon, Zhao tweeted a withering assessment of FTX’s problems:“In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.”He also alluded to allegations of “mishandled funds” and investigations by US regulators.Binance was out. FTX’s best shot at a lifeline was gone.The full extent of FTX’s financial problems aren’t yet known, but multiple reports say the firm is facing an $8 billion shortfall. Without a quick infusion of equity, Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors Thursday, the firm was facing bankruptcy.Since the Binance deal fell apart, Bankman-Fried has been scrambling to raise funds. On Thursday, tweeted that there were “a number of players” the firm was in talks with.“We’re spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity,” he wrote in his apology thread. “Every penny” of that, plus the remaining collateral, will go toward making users whole, followed by investors and employees.”Despite its reputation as a dependable, low-risk investment portal, FTX’s business appears to have been built on a complex, extremely risky kind of leveraged trading.Customers deposited their money to engage in crypto trading. But it appears that FTX instead took billions of dollars worth of that money and loaned it out to its sister firm, Alameda, to fund those high-risk bets, according to The Wall Street Journal.Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine put it another way: “FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless.”At the end of the day, FTX experienced the crypto equivalent of a classic bank run. Customers wanted their money out, and FTX didn’t have it.In traditional finance, customers’ funds are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits. The FDIC does not insure stocks or cryptocurrencies, however, leaving the fate of FTX’s customers and investors in question.One of those investors was the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, which said it invested $95 million in both FTX International and its US entity “to gain small-scale exposure to an emerging area in the financial technology sector.” In a statement Thursday, the plan noted that any loss on its investment would have “limited impact” as it represents less than 0.05% of its total net assets.After a chaotic week, FTX filed for bankruptcy. In a statement, FTX said John Ray III has been appointed the new CEO and that many exchange employees are expected to stay on to run the firm as it goes through the Chapter 11 process.Ray said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to “assess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.”Regulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong at FTX, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.Securities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, froze some of the embattled exchange’s assets on Thursday. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, according to the Wall Street Journal. (The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.)The collapse of FTX is “a loud warning bell that cryptocurrencies can fail,” Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. “And just like we saw with over-the-counter derivatives that led to a financial crisis, these failures can have a ripple effect on consumers and other parts of our financial system.”",business,0.0

Blado added that the petitioner does not have to provide a reason to the NLRB for doing so. The move to withdraw comes roughly two weeks after the petition was submitted, per the NLRB’s docket of the case.In an email to CNN Business, ALU President Chris Smalls played down the significance of the withdrawn petition. “The withdrawal isn’t nothing to worry about,” he said. “We will be refilling within the next few weeks just as we did with our JFK8 campaign,” Smalls added, referring to the name of the unionized facility in Staten Island, New York.Smalls did not offer a reason for the decision to withdraw and potentially refile the petition.Since the watershed union win at JFK8, the ALU hasn’t seen success with organizing efforts at other Amazon facilities. In addition to the Amazon workers near Albany voting against joining the union last week, the ALU also failed to win enough votes to unionize a smaller Amazon outpost in Staten Island.Moreover, Amazon has refused to recognize or meet with the union at JFK8 — and continues to challenge the union’s election win. Labor experts say the saga reveals how difficult it is to organize a union under current labor laws.Amazon has long maintained that it prefers working with employees directly, versus through a union. After the workers near Albany voted against forming a union, an Amazon spokesperson said the company is “glad” to see “they chose to keep the direct relationship with Amazon as we think that this is the best arrangement for both our employees and customers.”Despite the uphill battle the union faces, Smalls previously told CNN Business that he sees the increase in organizing efforts at Amazon facilities across the country as its own victory.“The expansion of the ALU is definitely historical by itself,” Smalls said. He added that the group has been fielding an explosion of interest from Amazon workers across the country since the ALU’s original win in Staten Island in April.",business,0.0
163,168,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/who-ends-covid-health-emergency/index.html,WHO says Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergency,2023-05-05 12:10:00,"Covid-19 is no longer a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said on Friday.WHO’s International Health Regulations Emergency Committee discussed the pandemic on Thursday at its 15th meeting on Covid-19, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concurred that the public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, declaration should end.“For more than a year the pandemic has been on a downward trend,” Tedros said at a news conference Friday.“This trend has allowed most countries to return to life as we knew it before Covid-19,” Tedros said. “Yesterday, the emergency committee met for the 15th time and recommended to me that I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted that advice.”The organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020, about six weeks before characterizing it as a pandemic.A PHEIC creates an agreement between countries to abide by WHO’s recommendations for managing the emergency. Each country, in turn, declares its own public health emergency – declarations that carry legal weight. Countries use them to marshal resources and waive rules in order to ease a crisis.The United States is set to let its Covid-19 public health emergency end on May 11.Covid-19 continues to spread, the virus is evolving and remains a global health threat, but at a lower level of concern, according to WHO officials.“There’s still a public health threat out there, and we all see that every day in terms of the evolution of this virus, in terms of its global presence, its continued evolution and continued vulnerabilities in our communities, both societal vulnerabilities, age vulnerabilities, protection vulnerabilities, and many other things,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme.“So, we fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit, but this is the history of pandemics,” Ryan said. “In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins. I know that’s a terrible thought but that is the history of pandemics.”Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead and head of its program on emerging disease, said that the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis is over but the disease is “here to stay” and the coronavirus that causes the disease is not going away any time soon.“While we’re not in the crisis mode, we can’t let our guard down,” Van Kerkhove said. “Epidemiologically, this virus will continue to cause waves. What we are hopeful of is that we have the tools in place to ensure that the future waves do not result in more severe disease, don’t result in waves of death and we can do that with the tools we have at hand. We just need to make sure that we are tracking the virus because it will continue to evolve.”There have been more than 765 million confirmed Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, according to WHO data. Nearly 7 million people have died. Europe has had the most confirmed cases overall, but the Americas have reported the most deaths. About 1 in 6 total deaths have been in the US.Cases peaked in December 2022 as Omicron swept the globe, hitting the Western Pacific particularly hard. But billions of vaccine doses have been administered globally, and deaths have remained far below previous peaks.Now, Covid-19 cases and deaths are about the lowest they’ve been in three years. Still, more than 3,500 people died in the last week of April and billions remain unvaccinated.Tedros said that, if needed, he would not hesitate to convene another emergency committee meeting and declare a global health emergency again if there is a significant rise in Covid-19 cases or deaths in the future.“Covid-19 has left and continues to leave deep scars on our world. Those scars must serve as a permanent reminder of the potential for new viruses to emerge with devastating consequences,” Tedros said.“One of the greatest tragedies of Covid-19 is that it didn’t have to be this way. We have the tools and technologies to prepare for pandemics better, detect them earlier, respond to them faster, and communicate their impact. But globally, a lack of coordination, a lack of equity, and lack of solidarity meant that those tools were not used as effectively as they could have been,” Tedros said. “We must promise ourselves and our children and grandchildren that we will never make those mistakes again.”",health,0.0
164,169,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/cdc-covid-19-data-changes/index.html,The way the US government tracks Covid-19 is about to change,2023-05-05 14:19:00,"When the US public health emergency ends May 11, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will have to change some of the ways it tracks Covid-19 in the United States, but the agency says it won’t lose its sightlines on the infection as it continues to be part of American life.On Thursday, for the first time in three years, the CDC will stop posting a national count of Covid-19 cases. The agency’s color-coded maps of county-level transmission and disease burden will be retired, the CDC will no longer track variants down to the state level, and it will update its genomic surveillance estimates every two weeks instead of weekly.“Though our data going forward will be different, they will continue to provide timely insights for CDC, for local health officials, as well as for the public to understand Covid-19 dynamics,” CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah said.“In short, we will still be able to tell that it’s snowing, even though we’re no longer counting every snowflake.”Instead of following Covid-19 cases, the agency will track the burden and spread of disease primarily through hospitalizations and deaths.The move to stop posting a national case count is largely symbolic. The number of Covid-19 cases known to public health officials has long been undercounted. The percent of detected cases has only fallen further as people have turned to rapid home testing for a diagnosis. At some points in the pandemic, experts estimated that the true number of cases was more than 14 times higher than official counts.Other metrics that people are used to seeing on the CDC’s Covid Data Tracker are also going to go away. As CNN previously reported, the CDC will stop publishing detailed, color-coded Covid-19 Transmission Levels and Covid-19 Community Level maps that have been tied to recommendations about when to wear masks, when it’s a good idea for people to test to prevent the spread of disease and when to avoid large indoor public gatherings.When the public health emergency ends, more states are expected to stop reporting Covid-19 cases to CDC. Iowa, for example, has already stopped. So the CDC says it won’t be feasible to maintain a national count or update its maps.Future recommendations for precautions like masking will instead be tied to hospitalization levels.Covid-19 will retain its designation as a nationally notifiable disease, but that’s just a recommendation, says Dr. Brendan Jackson, who leads the CDC’s Covid-19 response. It doesn’t carry any authority for required reporting.  When the public health emergency ends, it will be a state-by-state decision whether to share those numbers, Jackson said Thursday.The CDC says it will still publish the case counts it gets from states, but that will be in a different section of its website, and the numbers won’t be totaled.Some experts say they’re disappointed to see that the CDC will have to go back to an older, fragmented system of having to ask states to share data.“We’re kind of reverting back to a system where the CDC kind of independently negotiates all these data sharing agreements with the states and they make it more voluntary,” said Beth Blauer, associate vice provost for public sector innovation at Johns Hopkins University.“I think having the states do this all independently doesn’t make a ton of sense because it doesn’t help us understand, in the aggregate, the impact that disease is having on our communities,” Blauer said.She also said it will be very difficult to scale this system back up should another large, immediate public health threat emerge.Starting next week, vaccination counts will become discretionary. Jackson said that most, but not all, of the 64 jurisdictions that report to the CDC have signed data use agreements to share their vaccine administration numbers.  They may not share as much as they have in the past about who is getting vaccinated or do it as frequently, which may limit the nation’s ability to spot widespread racial, ethnic or socioeconomic disparities for future vaccination campaigns.  Starting in June, the CDC says, it will update its vaccination data on a monthly basis.Laboratories will no longer be required to send testing data to the CDC, which will hamper the ability to understand test positivity rates, a metric that, early in the pandemic, helped public health officials know whether they were doing enough testing or if transmission in a community was going up or down.  Positivity rates were used in the transmission maps but also for the CDC’s tracking of variants.The CDC will still get some lab testing data from another system called the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System, a network of about 450 labs that help it track illnesses like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.Variant tracking will continue, but the CDC will have to adjust some of the metrics it uses to model variant proportions.  State-level estimates of variant proportions with go away, but regional levels will remain.  Those will be updated twice a month going forward instead of weekly, as they are now.The way the CDC will collect data on deaths will change, too. Instead of scraping numbers from state website and getting direct reports from states, which counted deaths based on the date they were reported, the CDC will switch to a national system that counts deaths based on death certificate data. The agency says this system has become much more timely and will be a more stable way to count Covid-19 deaths going forward. It will also add a new metric to its death reporting: the percentage of all deaths reported that week that are caused by Covid-19.Hospitals will still have to report Covid-19 data through April 2024, but they won’t track as many metrics or submit that information as frequently.  Hospitals have shared information daily through most of the pandemic, but now that reporting will be weekly.Hospitalizations and deaths are known as lagging indicators because they increase only after people have gotten sick. Studies released Friday from CDC epidemiologists show that hospitalizations may not lag behind cases as much as we once thought they did.The new studies, published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, show that Covid-19 hospitalizations lagged one day behind increases in reported cases and four days behind increases in emergency room visits.The research also shows that the new system the CDC will be using to track deaths will show trends 13 days earlier than data collected from states, the system that’s being discontinued.With case levels low across most of the country, the need for these kinds of insights has gone away, or scientists have found other ways to get the information, such as testing of wastewater, which begins to increase about a week before testing data reflects an uptick in spread. Wastewater testing is available in some places, but not all areas have this capability.The CDC will also maintain traveler surveillance, testing wastewater on airplanes in an effort to spot new incoming threats.The CDC will also maintain what it calls sentinel systems: smaller, but nationally representative networks of hospitals and laboratories that will feed in more detailed data. This is much the same way the agency tracks patterns in other respiratory diseases, such as the flu and RSV.  The CDC says recent investments in these sentinel systems will help it maintain eyes on Covid-19.Instead, it will be using hospitalizations and emergency room visits as the primary ways it tracks Covid-19 and as the basis for its recommendations. When hospitalization rates in an area are high, for example, it will be recommending that people wear masks, said Jackson.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky acknowledged some of these data changes in a Senate committee hearing this week, although she emphasized that the CDC was not “changing the steam” of its work on Covid-19.“As the public health emergency is set to end next week, I do want to just reiterate that we at CDC are not changing the steam at which we are working through resolving this public health emergency,” Walensky said at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions.“It is the case at the end of the public health emergency, we will have less window as to the data,” she said. “We won’t get laboratory reporting. We won’t get case reporting. So we’ll lose some of that.”",health,0.0

However, there were some side effects reported; there were three deaths in the trial among people taking the drug, two of which were attributed to adverse events such as brain swelling or microhemorrhages, known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA. The trial was run in more than 1,700 patients for 18 months.“For every medicine, for every disease, there are potential risks and potential benefits,” said Lilly’s chief scientific and medical officer, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky. But he noted that almost half of the participants taking the drug, 47%, showed no decline on a key measure of cognition over the course of a year, compared with 29% of people taking a placebo.That’s “the kind of efficacy that’s never been seen before in Alzheimer’s disease,” Skovronsky said.Alzheimer’s affects more than 6 million Americans, with an estimated 1.7 million to 2 million people over 65 in the early stages of the disease, according to Lilly. Drug development for Alzheimer’s has been riddled with failures, but Lilly’s drug is among a new group showing promise. The first, Eisai and Biogen’s Leqembi, received accelerated FDA approval in January.Skovronsky, who noted he’s been working in the field of Alzheimer’s for 25 years, said the new class of medicines is different because of “the amount of amyloid they can clear and how quickly they can clear it.”The medicine is given by infusion once a month. Donanemab clears amyloid so effectively, the company says, that a majority of patients in the trial – 52% – were able to stop taking the medicine by one year, and 72% were able to do so by a year and a half. Researchers will continue to monitor these patients’ progress.In the trial, researchers looked at the participants in two groups, separated by levels of a brain protein known as tau. A 35% slowing in cognitive and functional decline was seen in the group with intermediate levels of tau, whose disease hadn’t progressed as far. When this intermediate group was combined with the group with higher levels of tau, the figure was 22%. The results have not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal.Lilly filed for accelerated approval with the FDA for donanemab based on earlier results but was rejected in January as the agency sought more data. With these results, the company will file for full approval, which is expected to lead to broader insurance reimbursement for the medicine. Leqembi was approved on an accelerated basis in January, and Medicare is not expected to cover the drug broadly until it receives full approval as well, most likely by early July.Leqembi is priced at $26,500 a year. Skovronsky declined to discuss potential pricing for donanemab before the drug is approved.",health,0.0
166,171,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/florida-abortion-term-pregnancy/index.html,"Because of Florida abortion laws, she carried her baby to term knowing he would die",2023-05-03 10:32:00,"A Florida woman, unable to get an abortion in her state, carried to term a baby who had no kidneys.Deborah Dorbert’s son Milo died in her arms on March 3, shortly after he was born, just as her doctors had predicted he would.“He gasped for air a couple of times when I held him,” said Dorbert, 33. “I watched my child take his first breath, and I held him as he took his last one.”She said her pregnancy was proceeding normally until November, when, at 24 weeks, an ultrasound showed that the fetus did not have kidneys and that she had hardly any amniotic fluid. Not only was the baby sure to die, her doctors told her, but the pregnancy put her at especially high risk of preeclampsia, a potentially deadly complication.Her doctors told her it was too late to terminate the pregnancy in Florida, which bans nearly all abortions after 15 weeks. The only options were to go out of state to get an abortion or to carry the baby to full term, and Dorbert and her husband didn’t have the money to travel.What followed was an agonizing 13 weeks of carrying a baby she knew would die and worrying about her own health. It left Dorbert with severe anxiety and depression for the first time in her life.Florida law allows abortions after 15 weeks if two doctors confirm the diagnosis of a fatal fetal abnormality in writing, but doctors in Florida and states with similar laws have been hesitant to terminate such pregnancies for fear someone will question whether the abnormality was truly fatal. The penalties for violating the law are severe: Doctors can go to prison and face heavy fines and legal fees.CNN reached out to Florida state Reps. Erin Grall and Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who co-sponsored the state’s 15-week ban, for comment on Dorbert’s situation.Grall did not respond. Persons-Mulicka sent a statement.“The intent of the law is quite clear. We are providing mothers with the resources they need to raise healthy children, empowering doctors to help their patients make informed decisions, and shifting the conversation to valuing life,” she wrote.Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law an even more restrictive measure that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks, with an exception for fatal fetal abnormalities. The law won’t go into effect until the state Supreme Court overturns its precedent on abortion or tosses out a case challenging state abortion restrictions.Deborah met Lee in 2014 while they were working at Publix in Lakeland, Florida, where she was a clerk and he was a team leader in the grocery department. They married three years later, and their son Kaiden was born a year after that.Last year, the couple was thrilled when they found out they were going to have a second child. On the day before Thanksgiving, when she was 23 weeks pregnant, Dorbert brought Kaiden to an ultrasound appointment.The 4-year-old was enthralled, looking at the screen and following along with the ultrasound technician as she pointed out the baby’s features.“He’d go, ‘yeah, there’s the eye’ or ‘there’s the hand,’ ” Dorbert remembered. “He was excited that he could see the baby on the monitor.”But abruptly, the technician stopped pointing at the screen and left the room to get the obstetrician.Her obstetrician’s ultrasound report that day shows a grim diagnosis: There was no right kidney, and it was unclear whether there was a left kidney. In addition, the baby had too little amniotic fluid, and the heart was swollen. The obstetrician referred Dorbert to a high-risk pregnancy expert.Because of the holiday, it took a week before the Dorberts could get in to see the specialist. They said a more detailed ultrasound at that appointment showed that the baby had no kidneys at all and that the lungs were under-developed.The condition is called Potter syndrome, and the specialist said it was ” ‘incompatible with life,’ ” Deborah remembers. She says the doctor told her the baby would be stillborn or would die within minutes, or at most hours, after birth.In this situation, doctors in states that allow abortions routinely give parents two options, according to Dr. Erika Werner, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts Medical Center and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.One is to induce birth and, if the baby is born alive, offer comfort care until death. The other is to carry the baby to full term.The Dorberts told the specialist that they wanted to induce birth, terminating the pregnancy, to spare the baby, themselves and their older son from suffering. They said the doctor agreed that this was a sound decision.Dorbert says the doctor told her that in all the cases he’d seen, “that was always the outcome – someone’s baby went stillborn – and the ones that did deliver, the babies pass shortly after birth.”But the doctor said he would need to check with his administration because of the Florida law that had gone into effect a few months before, banning most abortions after 15 weeks.The law makes an exception if “two physicians certify in writing that, in reasonable medical judgment, the fetus has a fatal fetal abnormality,” which the law defines as “a terminal condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, regardless of the provision of life-saving medical treatment, is incompatible with life outside the womb and will result in death upon birth or imminently thereafter.”About a month passed without a decision. Finally, Dorbert’s obstetrician informed her that she wouldn’t terminate the pregnancy. By this point, Dorbert was 27 weeks along.Dr. Stephanie Ros, a high-risk pregnancy expert in Tampa and a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said she’s not surprised that the doctor was unwilling to do the termination, considering that the law does not spell out exactly what would be considered a “terminal condition.”“With health care, there are very few black-and-whites. There are so many things that are a little bit nuanced,” she said. “The moment the law came out, I think everyone was scrambling to try to figure out what exactly that language intended to convey.”If a doctor is convicted of running afoul of the law, the penalties are severe: up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines, not to mention steep legal fees.Ros, an associate professor at the University of South Florida, said that after the law was passed, she and colleagues at Florida academic medical centers wrote a list of conditions they considered fatal fetal abnormalities. Renal agenesis – the absence of kidneys – was on the list.For that reason, she said, she would feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy with a fetus with this condition, but she “absolutely understands” why doctors who aren’t at academic medical centers, such as Dorbert’s obstetrician, would refuse.“It’s tricky because of how this law was written in the first place,” she said.In Dorbert’s situation, part of that trickiness has to do with the pregnancy 10 years ago of a woman she’s never met.In 2012, Jaime Herrera Beutler, then a Republican US congresswoman from Washington state, found out she was pregnant with a baby who, like Dorbert’s, had Potter syndrome. The condition affects more than just the kidneys. Functioning kidneys produce amniotic fluid, which a fetus “breathes” into their lungs, and if there’s not enough of it, the lungs don’t develop properly.In the womb, the baby can live with underdeveloped lungs because the placenta provides oxygen. But after birth, the baby is on their own.During her pregnancy, Herrera Beutler and her husband, Dan, heard the baby’s heartbeat on an ultrasound.“That’s pretty convincing. We know she’s still alive,” Dan Beutler told CNN in 2017. “We had this gut feeling of ‘there has to be something.’ ”The couple sought out an experimental treatment at Johns Hopkins Medicine in which doctors transfused saline solution into the uterus to help mimic amniotic fluid. After a series of weekly infusions, their daughter, Abigail, was born 12 weeks prematurely. She survived on dialysis until she was big enough for a kidney transplant from her father.In a 2019 essay in the Wall Street Journal, Herrera Beutler wrote that Abigail was a “healthy, happy big sister.”“Through divine intervention and some courageous doctors we now have Abigail in our lives,” she wrote.Herrera Beutler, now a strategic adviser to the Children’s Hospital Association, did not respond to requests for comment on this story.Abigail’s parents have said she is the first baby without kidneys to survive childbirth. A 2014 Hopkins news release called Abigail’s survival “a medical marvel.”In 2017, Hopkins and several other academic medical centers started a clinical trial to see how well the saline treatment worked.In the study, 18 pregnant women whose fetuses did not have kidneys received uterine saline infusions. They went to the researchers one to three times a week, and each time, the doctors inserted a needle into their uterus for the procedure, which could take up to an hour. They made these visits for about 11 weeks.Four of those 18 children are still alive, according to Dr. Jena Miller, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal Therapy and co-principal investigator of the study.One baby was stillborn, and the other 17 were born prematurely and alive. Of those 17 babies, 14 survived to 2 weeks of age. Over the next two years, eight of those 14 children died without ever leaving the hospital.The remaining six babies spent an average of about six months in the hospital and then went home. Two later died; the other four are on dialysis. None has received a kidney transplant.Miller presented preliminary results from the study at a February meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.She noted that in the study, even when babies did survive, they are “medically complex and have required multiple surgeries.”“You’re subjecting parents to a very medically complex child, and for some families, they’re happy. They’re OK with doing that,” she said. “The family that chooses that, they’re all in for that. But it’s their choice to make. There are absolutely families that just do not have the resources or the capacity for that journey. They would not choose that journey for themselves or their child.”By the time the Dorberts got the news that her doctors wouldn’t terminate Deborah’s pregnancy, she was 27 weeks along.As the baby grew, Dorbert started having terrible pain in her ribs and back, much worse than anything she’d experienced during her pregnancy with Kaiden. She says her obstetrician explained that without cushioning from the amniotic fluid, the baby had a more direct impact on her body.Dorbert says they didn’t have the money to travel out of state to get an abortion. By this time, they’d left their jobs at Publix; she was doing Instacart deliveries, and Lee was working at an insurance company.A few weeks later, at 31 weeks pregnant, she had a regular visit with her longtime family physician, Dr. David Berger.She told him about how carrying a baby she knew would die had taken a terrible toll.“I just got very depressed, and the anxiety was horrible. I just didn’t want to get out of bed most days. I would just break down crying,” Dorbert told CNN. “[I] just didn’t want to do anything but sit on the couch and cry.“I continued to feel this baby move,” she added, “knowing that I’m going to give birth and watch my child pass.”Having to stay pregnant hurt not just her, she said, but also her husband and son.“I really stepped back as a mom because I struggled,” she said. “He’s a 4-year-old boy, he wants to have fun, he wants to play, and he wants his mother to play with him.” But instead, she told Kaiden to watch TV as she lay on the couch.Lee Dorbert said it was “painful for me to watch” his wife suffer, as there was “nothing I could really do besides just being there for her.”Furious about what his patient was experiencing, with Deborah’s permission, Berger published videos on YouTube and TikTok on January 26 and more TikTok videos on February 2 and February 24.“This brings me so much sorrow to see that a couple – or anybody – would have to go through something like this. In all honesty, it makes me embarrassed to be a Floridian,” Berger said in the YouTube video.Viewers offered the Dorberts money to travel out of state to terminate the pregnancy. But the couple worried that they would get arrested.Florida law doesn’t forbid such travel, but the Dorberts were concerned.“The thing that scared us [was] we didn’t know if we’d go to jail. We didn’t know if we’d be fined. We still had another son. We couldn’t have anything happen to us, because we have another child,” Deborah said.As the weeks passed, Kaiden watched his mother’s belly grow. At first somewhat indifferent to having a sibling, he began to warm up to the idea.“As we continued to see my belly grow, he knew there was a baby in there,” she said. As he saw and felt the baby move, “he was getting excited. He’s like, ‘there’s a baby in your tummy!’ ”Kaiden was so looking forward to meeting his little sister – they didn’t know the sex at the time, but he assumed it would be a girl – that he urged his mother to “just spit the baby out.” In his mind, he and the baby were already a team, and so when his parents urged him to pick up his toys or eat his vegetables or take a bath, he would say, “my sister told me I don’t have to do that.”Unsure of what to tell Kaiden, the Dorberts consulted a therapist and decided it would easier on their son if they waited until just before the baby was born to let him know his sibling wasn’t coming home.On February 18, a few weeks before she delivered, the Washington Post published a story about the Dorberts.Deborah said it elicited one “hateful” letter, but she took some comfort from many “heartwarming” emails the Washington Post reporter forwarded her from readers who sent “their love and kindness.”Once she got to 37 weeks, Dorbert’s obstetrician told her they could induce labor. The night before delivery, they told Kaiden that the baby had died, and he broke down crying.The next day, after birth, Milo “looked more on the blue side. He gasped for air, and you could tell he was really trying hard to breathe,” Dorbert remembers.His parents and Deborah’s parents cuddled him for 94 minutes before he took his last breath.They were “making sure he felt loved, and he wasn’t in pain, even though I knew he was in pain,” Deborah said.Lee sang to Milo “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley & The Wailers and read him the book “I’ll Love You Forever” about a polar bear cub – Kaiden’s favorite story.“He didn’t open his eyes at all when we held him, and he passed away in my arms,” Deborah said.Milo’s tiny hand- and footprints were taken and memorialized inside the front cover of the book.She said she knows it would have been emotionally wrenching if the pregnancy had been terminated when her baby’s birth defect was first spotted, at 24 weeks. But being forced to carry the baby for 13 more weeks, knowing that he would die, made it even more horrific.Those 13 weeks are what led to the anxiety and depression and debilitating back pain, she said, making it harder on her, Lee and Kaiden.  It was during those 13 weeks that Kaiden got so excited to have a new sibling, only to have that joy taken away.She still suffers emotionally and physically from those 13 weeks, and it took a toll on her marriage.She and Lee are now in marriage counseling. “We’re making small steps, but it’s going to take time,” she said.Deborah is angry at the politicians whom she blames for forcing them to experience those gut-wrenching 13 weeks.“I think they need to leave it up to the doctors to treat each and every one of their patients the way they need to be treated,” she said. “I don’t think politicians have a place [in] health care. That’s why we have doctors.”Her physicians have reassured her that she’s not at higher risk of having another child with Potter syndrome. Her husband and son want another child, Deborah said, but at this point, she doesn’t.“I can’t go through another trauma like this pregnancy,” she said. “I felt the baby the whole time.”",politics,0.0
167,172,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/murthy-loneliness-isolation/index.html,Surgeon general lays out framework to tackle loneliness and ‘mend the social fabric of our nation’,2023-05-02 09:01:00,"US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy released an advisory Tuesday addressing the “epidemic of loneliness and isolation” affecting the country and laying out a framework for a “National Strategy to Advance Social Connection.”The advisory is part of the Biden administration’s broader efforts to address mental health, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday.“In recent years, about one-in-two adults in America reported experiencing loneliness,” Murthy says in the advisory. “And that was before the COVID-19 pandemic cut off so many of us from friends, loved ones, and support systems.”Research has showed that loneliness and isolation are linked to sleep problems, inflammation and immune changes in younger adults. In older people, they’re tied to symptoms such as pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety and shorter life span. In people of all ages, they may be associated with higher risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, addiction, suicidality and self-harm, and dementia.But social connection can help, Murthy’s office said in a statement, serving as a buffer to health problems while making communities more resilient.“Loneliness I think of as a great masquerader. It can look like different things,” Murthy told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “Some people, they become withdrawn. Others become irritable and angry. … I think the time you get concerned is when you start experiencing a feeling of loneliness for prolonged periods of time. If you feel lonely, you pick up the phone and call a friend, and then it goes away, or you get in the car and go see a family member, that’s OK. That’s loneliness acting like hunger or thirst, a signal our body sends us when we need something for survival. It’s when it persists that it becomes harmful.”Social connection is as essential to humanity as food, water or shelter, the advisory says. Humans have historically needed to rely on each other for survival, and modern people remain wired for that connection and for proximity to others.“Given the profound consequences of loneliness and isolation, we have an opportunity, and an obligation, to make the same investments in addressing social connection that we have made in addressing tobacco use, obesity, and the addiction crisis,” Murthy says in his advisory. “We are called to build a movement to mend the social fabric of our nation. It will take all of us – individuals and families, schools and workplaces, health care and public health systems, technology companies, governments, faith organizations, and communities – working together to destigmatize loneliness and change our cultural and policy response to it.”The framework is rooted in six pillars.The first, strengthening social infrastructure in communities, involves boosting programs like volunteer organizations or religious groups, policies like public transit or education, and physical elements like libraries and green spaces.“Investing in local communities and in social infrastructure will fall short if access to benefits is limited only to some groups,” the advisory notes. “Equitable access to social infrastructure for all groups, including those most at-risk for social disconnection, is foundational to building a connected national and global community.”The second pillar calls for more “pro-connection public policies.” Governments and institutions are urged to adopt an approach that recognizes that policies can benefit or hinder connection and that “every sector of society is relevant to social connection.” Policymakers should focus on reducing disparities in connection.The third pillar relies on the crucial role of public health and health care delivery systems to address social connection. Murthy calls for increased investment in educating health care providers about the physical and mental benefits of social connection and the risks of disconnection. Patients’ needs should be assessed and supported, and organizations should track prevalence of disconnection in communities and advance local solutions, he says.For the fourth pillar, reforming digital environments, Murthy singles out the “tangible impact” of technology on Americans’ daily lives and connections. “Technology can also distract us and occupy our mental bandwidth, make us feel worse about ourselves and our relationships, and diminish our ability to connect with others. Some technology fans the flames of marginalization and discrimination, bullying, and other forms of severe social negativity.”The framework calls for more data transparency from tech firms, as well as the establishment and implementation of safety standards such as age-related protections. It also encourages development of “pro-connection technology to promote healthy social connection, create safe environments for discourse, and safeguard the well-being of users.”The fifth pillar, deepening knowledge, urges stakeholders such as officials, policymakers, health care providers and researchers to collaborate on a research agenda to address gaps in the data. “Consistent measurement will be critical to better understanding the driving forces of connection and disconnection, and how we can be more effective and efficient in addressing these states.”The final pillar urges a culture of connection in which Americans “cultivate values of kindness, respect, service, and commitment to one another.” Everyone can use their voice to emphasize these values and model healthy connections, Murthy says, and the nation’s institutions should invest in demonstrating them.The advisory concludes with suggestions about how specific groups – including governments, health organizations, schools, workplaces and individuals – can help advance social connection.Parents and caregivers have an especially powerful role, the advisory says. They can model healthy connection by spending time together, setting aside time for screen-free socializing, and engaging in constructive conflict resolution. They’re also urged to encourage individual friendships and group activities, to be aware of how young people spend their time online and to watch for potential warning signs of loneliness or isolation.Individual Americans might take time out of each day to connect with a friend or family member and minimize distractions during conversations. Regularly practicing service and gratitude can encourage others to do the same. Cut back on things that lead to disconnection, such as harmful social media use or time spent in unhealthy relationships. Be open with health care providers about significant social changes that may affect levels of connection, and reach out to a loved one, counselor, provider or crisis hotline in times of struggle.",health,0.0
168,173,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/health/nurses-unhappy-survey/index.html,"‘A crisis in nursing is upon us,’ nursing survey shows, even after the pandemic",2023-05-01 19:46:00,"As an emergency room nurse, Terry Foster has cared for people on their worst days. He loves his work, and as president of the Emergency Nurses Association, a group that represents about 50,000 nurses, he’s met countless others who share a similar commitment to helping others. But he’s concerned about the future of his profession.“I’ve worked in the emergency department 45 years, and you’re not going to hear people say that again. I don’t think you’re going to see that kind of tenure anymore,” he said.Something changed with the Covid-19 pandemic, Foster said. That change is among the many captured in the 2023 Survey of Registered Nurses from AMN Healthcare, a nurse staffing company.The biannual survey of 18,000 nurses, published Monday, points to what AMN Chief Clinical Officer Dr. Cole Edmonson called a “perfect storm” of problems for the profession that could leave the US health care industry without the nurses it needs.The survey, which was conducted in January, shows a group of professionals who care very much about their work, but it also shows a significant decline in work satisfaction and a significant increase in stress levels. Many are thinking about leaving the profession.“A crisis in nursing is upon us,” Edmonson says in the survey.Nurses typically like their profession, surveys have found over the years. For more than a decade, their career satisfaction was around 80% to 85%. Yet when they were asked in the new poll whether they were extremely satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their choice of nursing as a career, the number dropped a full 10 percentage points from the most recent AMN survey, done in 2021.If 71% of nurses say they are satisfied with their work in 2023, that’s still a lot of people, but the drop is concerning, said Christin Stanford, vice president of client solutions for AMN Healthcare.“I don’t think any of us were prepared to see just how drastic the drop was in career job satisfaction, mental health and well-being, and what the overall feeling of the nurse profession today was,” she said.Another troubling sign, she said, is that younger nurses seem less satisfied with their careers than older professionals.Research has shown that nurses who are satisfied with their work typically stay on the job. But only 63% of millennials and 62% of Gen Zers said they were satisfied with their career choice, as opposed to 78% of baby boomers.“The overall data is very concerning. But if you segment out and look at a few different splices or populations within the survey data, it is even more distressing,” Stanford said.The survey found that many nurses are thinking about leaving their jobs.Hospitals could face the most instability. Only 15% of hospital nurses say they will continue in the same job in one year, the survey found.Nearly a third of all the nurses surveyed said they are likely to leave the profession, up 7 points from the 2021 survey.Only 40% said they will stay in the same job in one year, a 5 percentage-point drop since 2021. The rest said they will look for work as a travel nurse, move to part-time or per diem work, take a job outside of nursing or patient care, or return to school.Foster, who works as an emergency room nurse in Northern Kentucky and was not involved in the AMN survey, in part faults typical burnout. About 100,000 registered nurses in the US left the workplace due to the stresses of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the results of a survey published this month by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.Foster says patients and their families have also changed in recent years.“There’s just a new level of incivility from the public,” he said.The same violence seen in social media videos of people attacking flight attendants or fast food workers is happening more and more in health care settings, he said. Health care workers are five times more likely to experience workplace violence than employees in all other industries, government surveys have found.“We’re just trying to take care of people, and they’re lashing out at us,” Foster said. “It’s patients who don’t want to wait, or they act out or are very dramatic or violent. And sometimes our patients are fine, but their families will lash out at us and threaten us.”This new survey showed that 4 out of 5 nurses said they experienced “a great deal” or “a lot of stress” in their work, an increase of 16 points since 2021.More nurses said they worried that their job was taking a toll on their health, and they often felt emotionally drained.Nearly 40% of nurses surveyed said they felt burnt out. Nearly a third said they felt misunderstood or underappreciated, and about the same number felt that they were not getting what they needed out of their job.Another part of the problem is a lack of adequate staffing.Only a third of those surveyed said they had the ideal time they needed with patients, a 10-point decrease from 2021. The percentage of nurses who were satisfied with the quality of care that they were able to provide fell 11 points, from 75% in 2021 to 64% in 2023.Stanford said that in just a couple of years, the profession will be 1 million nurses short, partially because of a demographic change.Baby boomers are reaching the age of retirement, and there will be more demand for nurses because boomers are also reaching the age when they need more medical care.Another problem is education. While the number of candidates who passed the nursing licensure exam has steadily grown over the years, according to the union National Nurses United, there are still many more people who want to become nurses than there are classes. Schools just don’t have enough people to teach, Stanford said.There may also be a lack of interest in doing the work in today’s environment.There are about a million registered nurses with active licenses who are not employed as nurses, according to a National Nurses United analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2021.Coming out of the pandemic, far too many hospitals cut corners on staffing and allowed a higher nurse-to-patient ratio, said Kristine Kittelson, an RN in Austin and a National Nurses United member. Essentially, that’s placed nurses in a moral dilemma, she said, where they can’t completely help their patients even if they want to.“We are being put in these challenging work environments that really forced us to feel like we, as nurses, aren’t providing the best care that we can,” said Kittelson. who also was not involved in the new survey. “We’re just not being given the resources that we need and the staffing that we need.”More flexibility in schedules could help, Stanford said. Do nurses have enough flexibility to take time off and take care of themselves?Nearly every nurse who participated in the new survey said they wanted increased staff support, a reduction in the number of patients per nurse, an increase in salary, a safer working environment and more opportunities to share their input with decision-making.“This is a great profession, and it’s very rewarding, but I think that the pandemic has really shown how undervalued we are,” Kittelson said. “We should just be able to put in a position to give patients what they deserve and not feel stressed.”",health,0.0
169,174,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/health/brain-surgery-in-utero/index.html,Doctors performed brain surgery on a baby before she was born and now she’s thriving,2023-05-04 09:21:00,"A team of doctors in Boston successfully performed a novel fetal surgery to treat a rare brain condition known as vein of Galen malformation.Although in utero surgery – performed before a baby is born – has been used for other conditions, this ultrasound-guided procedure was among the first for this condition. Details of the procedure, which took place in March, were published in the journal Stroke on Thursday.The condition occurs when the blood vessel that carries blood from the brain to the heart, also known as the vein of Galen, doesn’t develop correctly. The malformation, known as VOGM, results in an overwhelming amount of blood stressing the vein and heart and can lead to a cascade of health problems.“Tremendous brain injuries and immediate heart failure after birth are the two big challenges,” Dr. Darren Orbach, a radiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and expert in treating VOGM, told CNN.Typically, infants are treated after they’re born using a catheter to insert tiny coils to slow down blood flow. However, Orbach said, the treatment often happens too late.Despite advancements in care, “50 to 60 percent of all babies with this condition will get very sick immediately. And for those, it looks like there’s about a 40 percent mortality,” Orbach said. About half of infants that survive experience severe neurological and cognitive issues, he said.When they learned of their fourth pregnancy, Derek and Kenyatta Coleman of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were surprised and excited. Kenyatta, 36, and Derek, 39, have been married for seven years and were ready to welcome a new addition to their family.Kenyatta said nothing seemed particularly notable about the pregnancy. After having three children, Kenyatta thought of ultrasounds as routine appointments.“Baby was doing well. The anatomy scan came back unremarkable. All of her biophysical profiles were all unremarkable,” said Kenyatta, who spoke to CNN exclusively.The Colemans even did genetic testing that characterized Kenyatta’s pregnancy as “low risk,” she said: “We honestly thought that we were in the clear.”But when Kenyatta went for an ultrasound at 30 weeks into her pregnancy, something was different. She remembers her doctor sitting her down and saying she was worried.“She shared with me that something wasn’t right in terms of the baby’s brain and also her heart was enlarged,” Kenyatta remembers.After more investigation, there was a diagnosis: VOGM.But the Colemans had learned about a clinical trial run by Brigham and Women’s and Boston Children’s hospitals that could provide treatment before their baby was born.Kenyatta remembers being told about the possible risks – preterm labor, or brain hemorrhage for the fetus – but the Colemans felt there was no other option for them. They wanted to join the trial.On March 15, exactly one month after the ultrasound that spotted the malformation, Kenyatta underwent surgery.But for this surgery, there were two patients: Kenyatta and her baby.Doctors had to make sure the fetus was facing the right position, with its head facing the mother’s abdominal wall. Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, division director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Reproductive Genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, partnered with Orbach to make sure that the fetus was not only in the right position for the procedure, but stayed there.Wilkins-Haug explained they used a technique borrowed from previous in utero cardiac surgeries. Once the fetus is in the optimal position, it “gets a small injection of medication so that it’s not moving and it is also getting a small injection of medication for pain relief,” Wilkins-Haug said.From there, the doctors inserted a needle through the abdominal wall, carefully threading a catheter through the needle, so that the tiny metal coils can fill up the vein, slow the blood flow and reduce the pressure.The baby showed signs of improvement immediately, with scans showing decreased blood pressure in key areas.“It was exhilarating at the moment that we had technical success at doing the embolization,” said Orbach.But success wasn’t defined by that moment alone, but rather, what would follow.“Will she be able to continuously show progress after? Will she need just additional support after I have her? Will she go into immediate heart failure still?” Kenyatta wondered.After the procedure, Kenyatta was slowly leaking amniotic fluid. Two days later, she went into labor at 34 weeks.On March 17, Denver Coleman was born, weighing 4 pounds and 1 ounce.“I heard her cry for the first time and that just, I – I can’t even put into words how I felt at that moment,” remembers Kenyatta.“It was just, you know, the most beautiful moment being able to hold her, gaze up on her and then hear her cry.”Her doctors were also pleased. “In the immediate new newborn period, she was very stable and didn’t need any of the immediate treatments that they typically need, whether it’s placing coils or whether it’s supporting her heart function with medications,” said Wilkins-Haug. “Our hope is that she won’t need any further coils placed.”Derek remembers visiting Denver for the first time in the neonatal intensive care unit and doctors asked if he wanted to kiss her.“I gave her a kiss and she was just making little baby noises and stuff,” he said. “That was all I needed right there.”Now, nearly two months after Denver was born, she continues to thrive, spending most of her time sleeping and eating. She’s not taking any medications for heart failure, and her neurological exam is normal. There’s no indication that she needs any additional interventions.“She’s shown us from the very beginning that she was a fighter,” Kenyatta said, “she’s demonstrated … “Hey, I wanna be here.’ “",health,0.0

Bacterial infections may cause illness in people with weakened immune systems.If the liquid comes into contact with skin or eyes, flush with large amounts of water and get medical attention if irritation persists. Signs and symptoms of bacterial infection can include fever, discharge, or red eyes.Some 500,000 tests were distributed to CVS Health, as well as about 16,000 tests to Amazon, the FDA said, and the agency is working with Roche Diagnostics to determine how many tests were sold to consumers.The FDA notes that none of the impacted lots were distributed through any federal testing programs.“If you received your tests through the COVID.gov/tests distribution or as part of other federal testing programs, they are not subject to this safety communication or product recall,” the release said.",health,0.0
171,176,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/covid-changes-predictions/index.html,Covid-19 experts say they warned White House about chance of an Omicron-level event within the next two years,2023-05-05 20:02:00,"In March, the White House reached out to about a dozen Covid-19 experts who are closely following the evolution of the coronavirus to ask a simple question: What did they think were the chances of the world seeing a highly mutated variant, akin to Omicron, within the next two years?The experts came up with a surprisingly narrow range of probabilities, between 5% and 30%, according to Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. He said the data was shared with him on the phone after he gave his own estimate of 15% to 20%.Most believed that the odds would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 20%.Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told CNN that he was one of those experts.He was approached by Dr. Ashish Jha, the Covid-19 response coordinator for the White House, for “just a informal phone conversation about my thoughts about immunity and variants and the chance of new variants emerging. It was not an official consultation meeting, as far as I could tell. It really was more of just a informal discussion amongst colleagues, I think,” Barouch said.“I said that there is a chance that there will be a new variant that is a fundamental shift, kind of like Delta to Omicron was. I thought that that was–it was not an infinitesimal chance, but it also is not an 80% chance,” he said. Jha pressed him to give a number, and Barouch told him, “my gut feeling is that it’ll be in the 20% range.”Barouch said he was pleasantly surprised to find out that most of the other experts have put the chances around there, too.One, Dr. Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, did some very simple modeling based on the fact that there’s been one Omicron-level shift in the virus in about 3½ years of transmission. That happened in November 2021, when the Omicron variant was first detected in the US.Carrying that forward in time, he estimated that the risk of another such event within the next two years was higher, about 40% between now and May 4, 2025, he told CNN.“40% feels intuitively high. The main reason that 40% number could be off is if in today’s world Omicron-like events are now much less likely than in the world of 2020-2021. However, I don’t see an obvious reason for this to be the case,” Bedford wrote in an email, noting that scientists are tracking highly mutated cryptic lineages in people who have been infected for long periods of time.The calls to experts came as the Biden administration prepared for the end of the public health emergency for Covid-19, which is set for Thursday.The White House’s effort to collect these expert estimates was first reported Friday by the Washington Post.The end of the US emergency will come with a host of changes to how the government tracks the pandemic, with data collection becoming less frequent in most cases and less granular.  Labs will no longer have to submit testing data to the government.  Reporting of cases by states will also become discretionary.Topol said he thinks the dismantling of data systems is a mistake, given the consensus that another highly disruptive variant could be on the way within a few years.“I wish there wouldn’t be as much letdown, because this is on the horizon, is a real risk,” he said.Topol said he’s also concerned by recent congressional efforts to reclaim funds that have been dedicated to coronavirus response, which some estimate could be as much as $50 billion.About $5 billion of that unspent money has been allocated to developing the next generation of Covid-19 vaccines, which Topol says are needed now more than ever to defend against an Omicron-level event.“This is why it’s so essential we get these next-generation vaccines, the nasal vaccines, the pan-coronavirus universal vaccines, the monoclonal antibodies that work against all versions of this virus,” Topol said.CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. An official said efforts to respond to Covid-19 will continue but in a different form after the public health emergency ends.“As we transition out of the emergency phase of Covid, the White House is standing up the Office of Pandemic Preparedness Response (OPPR) as required by law,” the official said.“OPPR will work with HHS and other agencies on continued Covid response work – including prep for future surges, as well as be the lead [Executive Office of the President] division for future pandemic preparedness.”",health,0.0

Wilson said that fewer than 25 of the school’s 310 students were sick.The school will reopen Monday, she said.Earlier this week, she said, the school “experienced an unusually high rate of flu-like symptoms including student fevers, and vomiting, namely at the early grade levels.”The closure also followed the death last week of a kindergartener who attended Marcus Garvey Academy, the school district said in a statement.The student’s cause of death is pending, the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office said Friday.“The student came to school with flu-like symptoms,” Wilson said.Haemophilus influenzae, or H. flu, is a disease caused by bacteria that can lead to illnesses such as ear infections and bronchitis or more serious bloodstream infections, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. It is not the same as illness caused by influenza viruses.“These bacteria live in people’s nose and throat, and usually cause no harm. However, the bacteria can sometimes move to other parts of the body and cause infection,” the CDC says.The bacteria spreads through airborne particles and typically infects children under 5 or adults 65 and up.Vaccines for Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) are recommended for children starting at 2 months old, according to the CDC, but they do not protect against other types of H. flu.The Detroit Health Department said in a statement Wednesday that it is working with the school district to monitor the illnesses and reminded the public that vaccines are available.“The Detroit Health Department offers vaccinations to children and adults to protect against many childhood diseases,” it said. “Vaccinations are also available at pediatric centers and primary care providers.”",health,0.0
173,178,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/wegovy-weight-loss-drug-limits/index.html,Novo Nordisk limits Wegovy doses for new patients as demand outpaces supply,2023-05-05 11:28:00,"Novo Nordisk, maker of the weight-loss drug Wegovy, said it would limit supply of starter doses as demand outpaces the company’s manufacturing capacity.The supply interruptions aren’t expected to affect higher doses of the medicine for people who already take the drug, the company said in a statement posted Thursday on its Wegovy website. Novo Nordisk said it anticipates that many people will have trouble filling prescriptions at the lower initial doses through September.The US Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy for chronic weight management for people with a body mass index of 30 or more, or 27 or more for people with a weight-related condition like high blood pressure. It and sister drug Ozempic, which is approved for type 2 diabetes, have soared in popularity, sweeping across social media sites and garnering mentions at the Oscars and on “Saturday Night Live.”“With rising rates of obesity, there is an increased demand” for drugs like Wegovy, said Dr. Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist at NYU Langone Health. She said that she hasn’t had issues filling prescriptions of Wegovy recently but that she had in the past.Wegovy is one of the brand names for semaglutide, which is part of a class of drugs that mimic the effects of an appetite-regulating hormone called GLP-1.  They stimulate the release of insulin, which helps lower blood sugar, and slow the passage of food through the gut. The FDA approved semaglutide for diabetes as Ozempic in 2017 and for weight loss as Wegovy in 2021. But Wegovy soon went into shortage amid production problems, and some supply problems have continued.People who take Wegovy for weight loss must continue to use it to maintain the effects; dropped pounds can return when they stop.Celebrities such as Chelsea Handler and Elon Musk have talked about using semaglutide or Wegovy. The Hollywood connection has been so strong that Novo Nordisk included in its “Frequently Asked Questions” section an inquiry about why celebrities can get Wegovy when it is unavailable for others. The drugmaker noted that it can’t control which specific people receive its medicines but said “we reinforce who our medicines are intended to treat based on their clinical trials and FDA-approved indications.”Interest is so high, Novo Nordisk said, that it will pause some promotion of Wegovy “to avoid stimulating further demand.”Wegovy is designed to be taken once a week by self-injection. Patients start on the lowest dose, 0.25 milligrams, and move up to the maintenance dose, 2.4 milligrams, over the course of 16 weeks. The lowest three doses are the ones Novo Nordisk says will have limited supply.This gradual dosage increase is designed to limit gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.“They are very challenging to take,” said Dr. Ethan Weiss, a preventional cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco and entrepreneur-in-residence at venture capital firm Third Rock. Still, he notes, “they are a really valuable option for those who have struggled and don’t want or are not eligible for surgery.”Novo Nordisk said hundreds of thousands of people in the US are on Wegovy, and it noted that an additional contract manufacturer recently started production to help increase supply. In the meantime, it recommends that people currently taking Wegovy contact their pharmacy about refills at least a week or two earlier than normal, and try multiple pharmacies if the first one doesn’t have the drug. It also suggests that health-care providers consider the potential supply disruptions when considering whether to start new patients on Wegovy.Although Ozempic and Wegovy contain the same key ingredient, Novo Nordisk noted that “the products are not interchangeable”; they have different indications, dosages, prescribing information and paces of titrating up.Ozempic has had supply issues as well for people with diabetes, even prompting British Columbia to move to restrict its sale amid a surge in prescriptions, many from Americans seeking the drug across the border.There have also been supply constraints on a similar medicine made by Eli Lilly, Mounjaro, which is approved only for diabetes, Jaisinghani said.She recommended against seeking weight-loss drugs through other avenues like medical tourism and compounding pharmacies.“It’s very important to speak to your doctor regarding your plan on how and where you are obtaining medications to make sure they are the FDA-approved formulation and safe for use,” she said.",health,0.0
174,179,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/obesity-diabetes-medication-wellness/index.html,How promising are new drugs to treat obesity and who should — and shouldn’t — use them? Our medical analyst explains,2023-05-05 11:08:00,"The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced last week that a medication developed to treat diabetes, tirzepatide, also had a substantial effect on reducing weight.Among the more than 900 adults with obesity and diabetes in a study, tirzepatide not only controlled their blood sugar but also helped those on the higher dose lose an average of 34 pounds, which was nearly 16% of their starting weight, according to a company news release. The participants took the drug for a year and five months.Eli Lilly plans to file for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration to market tirzepatide for treating obesity.Another pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk, manufactures the medication semaglutide, which the FDA has already approved to treat diabetes under the brand name Ozempic and to treat obesity under the brand name Wegovy. Celebrities have claimed to use it as a weight-loss tool, and its widespread use has triggered medication shortages.How exactly do semaglutide and tirzepatide work? How promising are they to treat obesity? What are the side effects? Who is eligible? What if someone wants to lose a few pounds for a wedding or event — should they take them?To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.CNN: Can you explain how medications like tirzepatide and semaglutide work?Dr. Leana Wen: Both of these injection medications were initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes. In the process of doing clinical trials, research also found that they have a substantial effect on weight loss.Semaglutide mimics a digestive hormone called glucagon-like protein-1, or GLP-1, that’s released by intestines when we eat. This hormone promotes insulin production, which encourages cells to take up glucose and therefore to reduce blood glucose levels. GLP-1 also slows gastric emptying and prolongs the sensation of feeling full. In addition, it suppresses appetite, resulting in people wanting to eat less and inducing weight loss.Tirzepatide mimics GLP-1 as well as another hormone released by the gut to stimulate insulin production called glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). While GIP isn’t as well studied as GLP-1, it appears to have a similar effect to it. Tirzepatide has this dual effect on GLP-1 and GIP, while semaglutide targets just GLP-1. It’s important to note that we do not have study results comparing these two medications side by side.CNN: How promising are these drugs to treat obesity?Wen: Of the two medications, semaglutide is the one that’s better studied. A 2022 study, published in JAMA Network Open, found that study participants’ mean weight loss after taking it for three months was 6.7 kilograms (14.8 pounds), or 5.9% body weight reduction. After six months, it was 12.3 kilograms (27.1 pounds), or 10.9%.Another study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, found a mean loss of body weight of 14.9% from baseline to more than a year later in the semaglutide group, compared with 2.4% in the placebo group.According to the news release from Eli Lilly, it appears that the company achieved a very high rate of weight loss as well. For those taking the higher dose of tirzepatide, patients lost an average of 15.6 kilograms (34.4 pounds), which was equivalent to a 15.7% body weight reduction, at over a year of treatment. These results are not yet published in a peer-reviewed publication, but if they hold up, these would be really excellent results as well.I think the key to emphasize here is that obesity is a chronic medical condition that increases the risk of developing many other diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol and many forms of cancers. Patients with obesity also experience higher rates of sleep apnea, arthritis, back pain and depression, and they are at higher risk for early mortality. It is really important to treat obesity as the disease that it is — and having effective medications to do so is crucial.CNN: What side effects should people be aware of?Wen: Virtually all medications and therapies have side effects. These are no different.The most common side effects are gastrointestinal discomforts, such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation. The medications have been associated in rare cases with pancreatitis and gallbladder problems, and some patients may experience low blood sugars while taking them. Some animal studies have linked them to thyroid tumors — and although this has not been seen in humans, patients are advised against using either of these medications if they or their family members have had a type of thyroid cancer known as medullary thyroid carcinoma.In addition, these are injection medications. As such, there could also be pain, swelling and redness at the injection site. And because these medications are relatively new, long-term effects are not known, and it is also not known as to how long people should continue taking them.Anecdotally, many patients have had their weight rebound back soon after stopping.CNN: Who is eligible to take them?Wen: Semaglutide is marketed under the brand name of Ozempic for treatment of diabetes and Wegovy for treatment of obesity. For Ozempic, it is approved only to treat type 2 diabetes. For Wegovy, patients are eligible if they have a body mass index, or BMI, at or over 27. They are to use it together with lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity and improved diet.Tirzepatide, also known as brand name Mounjaro, is only approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes. However, like other prescription medications, it can be prescribed for what’s called off-label use by physicians. Some physicians prescribe Mounjaro and Ozempic for treatment of obesity, even though (they are) not approved by the FDA for this purpose.CNN: Who shouldn’t take these drugs? What if someone wants to lose a few pounds for a wedding or event — should they take them?Wen: Well, you just described the type of person who should not take these medications. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are serious medical conditions. These medications should be reserved for individuals with these conditions.These are not medications to be taken by nondiabetic people who do not have obesity. In addition, individuals who are considered overweight or to have obesity based on BMI may not need these medications. In general, just like for other chronic conditions of hypertension and diabetes, people should try lifestyle modifications first. Only if these modifications do not work should medications be considered in consultation with your doctor, and even then, the lifestyle changes should continue.I want to emphasize that these are not medications to be used for vanity purposes. Someone who is trying to lose a few pounds for a wedding or event should not take them for several reasons. First, it’s very likely that once that person stops taking the medication, the weight will come right back. Second, there are better ways to lose weight, and, more importantly, to maintain good health. Third, this is not what the medication is intended for. Given the medication shortages that have occurred, a person taking it for this kind of short-term use could be taking it away from patients who really need it for their medical conditions.",health,0.0
175,180,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/health/bird-flu-vaccine/index.html,"US government is testing avian flu vaccines for birds, but ending the historic outbreak isn’t that simple",2023-05-05 07:36:00,"The United States is facing what some experts are calling “a new era for bird flu.”Since January 2022, the country has been battling the biggest outbreak yet of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wildlife. The virus is a major threat to commercial and backyard flocks, and it has started to show up in hundreds of mammals, including a handful of pet cats.The risk to humans is low; there has been only one human case of this virus in the US since the outbreak began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and nine cases globally, mostly among people who work with birds. The CDC says there are trials underway of vaccines that could be used to protect humans in case the virus changes and becomes more of a threat.Separately, the US Department of Agriculture, the US National Poultry Research Center and labs at a handful of American universities have been experimenting with vaccine candidates to be used in birds.The USDA’s Agriculture Research Service started trials of four vaccine candidates for animals in April and expects to have initial data on a single-dose vaccine available this month. A two-dose vaccine challenge study – in which animals are exposed to the virus to see how well the vaccine works – should produce results in June.If the animal vaccines look to be protective, the USDA’s next step would be to work with manufacturers on whether it would be feasible to use them.One manufacturer, Zoetis, announced April 5 the development of a vaccine geared toward currently circulating virus strains. The company says it would take about a year to get to the distribution stage in the US.Vaccines are already available in other countries, including China, Egypt, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico and Vietnam, and some nations are vaccinating their commercial flocks.However, in the United States, not all poultry experts are ready to use a vaccine, even if one becomes available – at least, not yet. Instead, their focus remains on eradicating the virus.As of April 26, the CDC says, nearly 58.8 million poultry have been affected by avian flu since January 2022. The virus has been detected in at least 6,737 wild birds, and the number is likely to be much higher. There have been poultry outbreaks in 47 states.Although this is the worst outbreak in history, improved biosecurity measures have vastly reduced the number of cases in the commercial sector, according to the USDA. When the outbreak began in early 2022, there were 51 detections among commercial poultry. In March 2023, there were only seven.The USDA says close surveillance work among its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and state and industry partners led to the reduction in cases.Generally, there ares two ways of confronting this kind of highly infectious disease in poultry, according to Rodrigo Gallardo, a professor in poultry medicine and a specialist in avian virology at the University of California, Davis.“One of them is through vaccination action. And then the other one is through eradication,” he said.In the United States, the latter is the approach for now, Gallardo said.If farmers detect even a single case in a flock, they will put down the birds right away.“The virus keeps replicating and amplifying if the birds are alive, so the only way of stopping the replication and limiting the dissemination is by depopulation,” Gallardo said.Tom Super, the senior vice president for communications for the National Chicken Council, the national trade association for the US broiler chicken industry, said in an email to CNN that although it supports the ongoing discussions about a vaccination program, “currently we support the eradication policy of APHIS and believe that right now this is the best approach at eliminating [bird flu] in the U.S.”The US Poultry and Egg Association said it’s “certainly a topic of discussion,” but the organization doesn’t have a position on implementing a vaccination program.A vaccination program comes with several complications, Gallardo said. Vaccinated birds would be protected, but with this highly infectious disease, they still could shed some virus that could infect unprotected birds.“So vaccination, in that case, creates amplification if it is not done right,” Gallardo said.Plus, it’s difficult to detect the disease in vaccinated birds. Birds that are vaccinated don’t always show signs if they’re sick, so it would be hard to know what birds to keep separate from the others. Tests also have a hard time telling the difference between antibodies generated by vaccination and antibodies from an infection.“If you’re not able to diagnose it, it might spread more than what it would do if you are able to diagnose it and eradicate it,” Gallardo said.Countries that have chosen the vaccination route see more endemic strains develop, meaning the virus is never really totally wiped out.“This is a very variable virus, and if you don’t update the vaccine that you’re applying to meet the change in the virus, then you won’t be able to completely protect the birds. Partial protection means more birds will be spreading the virus,” Gallardo said.A vaccine has never been used against highly pathogenic avian influenza in the US, according to the USDA. The agency created a vaccine after an outbreak in 2014 and 2015, but that involved a different strain, so it wouldn’t work on the latest version of the virus.The logistics of a vaccine like this are difficult, said Dr. Yuko Sato, an associate professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University.“You have to make sure that the new vaccine will protect against this current virus and hope that it doesn’t mutate or change so that the vaccine will continue to be protective,” Sato said.“The vaccine is not a silver bullet. This is not going to prevent infection of the birds, so in order to have an exit strategy as the country, you would have to make sure that if you vaccinate, if you still have positive birds, you have to be able to make sure that you could stamp out the virus. Otherwise, we’ll never be looking at eradicating the virus from the United States.”Another concern: Birds are a big business in the US.The US has the largest poultry industry in the world, with 294,000 poultry farms. The market size for chicken and turkey meat production alone for 2023 is projected to generate $57.8 billion, according to market analysis firm IbisWorld.Bird flu has hurt business in the US, but it could do so in a bigger way if the nation vaccinates poultry, according to the National Chicken Council.“The National Chicken Council does not support the use of a vaccine for [bird flu] for a variety of reasons – the primary one being trade.  Most countries, including the US, do not recognize countries that vaccinate as free of [bird flu] due to concerns that vaccines can mask the presence of the disease. Therefore, they do not accept exports from countries that do vaccinate,” Super wrote in his email.The US broiler industry is the second largest exporter of chicken in the world. It exports about 18% of the chicken meat produced in the United States, valued at more than $5 billion annually.“If we start vaccinating for [bird flu] in the U.S., the broiler industry will lose our ability to export which will have a significant impact on the industry – while costing billions and billions of dollars to the U.S. economy every year,” Super said.With the way the disease is spreading, scientists would also probably have to vaccinate wildlife – which is nearly impossible.Of the birds affected in this outbreak, about 76% are commercial egg-laying hens, 17% are turkeys, and only 5% are broilers, the chickens used for meat, Super said. The rest of the cases have been among ducks, backyard chickens and game birds.“So the U.S. poultry sector that least needs a vaccine would have the most to risk from using one,” he said.",health,0.0
176,181,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/health/chinese-postpartum-care-wellness/index.html,"Chinese postpartum confinement, called ‘zuo yue zi,’ is gaining Western appeal",2023-05-07 02:06:00,"You cannot carry heavy things. You should sleep more. No working. No household chores.And the list goes on as Carol Chan explained her postpartum instructions for new mom Taylor Richard.Chan is a “pui yuet,” also called a confinement nanny, who lives with families after a baby is born. She prepares meals and herbal medicines, takes care of the baby and provides guidance on being a new mother.Richard, a content creator from Canada, traveled to Hong Kong to become a model and fell in love with her husband, Tom, there. They married in November 2018, and Richard gave birth to their son, Levi, in March 2022.Richard decided to hire Chan, who lived with the family for a month and spent an additional month helping out.Richard vlogged about her experience with Chan on her YouTube channel, and that video went viral with 2.9 million views. The reaction was mostly admiration and praise from Richard’s primarily Western followers.The concept of Chinese confinement — “zuo yue zi,” or “sitting the month”— is when a new mother stays at home for one month to allow her body to rest after giving birth.During that time, the pui yuet makes dishes catering to the mother’s physical needs and helps her with milk production and other concerns. The pui yuet also cares for the mother with massage, body wraps and lessons on how to take care of the new baby.Richard and Chan declined to share the cost of Chan’s services. Few entities track the pricing of nannies in Hong Kong on a consistent basis because most negotiations are directly between clients and the nannies.The estimated cost for a pui yuet in Hong Kong ranges from 63,800 Hong Kong dollars (US $8,100) to 268,000 Hong Kong dollars (US $34,100) for 26 to 30 nights for a live-in nanny, according to a 2021 survey by the Consumer Council, a statutory body in Hong Kong dedicated to protecting consumer rights. The council, which surveyed 19 companies or organizations that provide postnatal care, also reported that the cost of a pui yuet working eight hours a day for 26 days ranges from 21,000 Hong Kong dollars (US $2,600) to 34,000 Hong Kong dollars (US $4,300).This tradition isn’t without criticism, and some have questioned whether the traditional methods of confinement in the Chinese community are too extreme and may be dangerous. In 2015, a new mother in Shanghai following the custom died of heatstroke after wrapping herself in a quilt and turning off the air conditioner, state media reported.In recent years, some people have adapted the tradition to more modern ways, taking advantage of available technology. It’s important to turn the air conditioner on when the weather is hot, Chan said, or else you could get sick. The traditional practice had been to avoid anything cold regardless of the weather.Richard, now 34, said she loved the time she spent with Chan.“It meant everything! My husband and I both don’t have any family members in Hong Kong, and as new parents we were pretty clueless,” she said via email. “Having someone take care of my body and gently guide me through my transition into motherhood made for a very positive beginning of my baby’s life. I’m forever grateful for Carol!”Richard was the first Western mother whom Chan cared for in her 12-year career. But since Richard’s YouTube video went viral, Chan said she’s gotten calls from Westerners asking for her services from as far away as the United States and United Kingdom. She’s now headed to Vancouver, British Columbia, in July to work as a pui yuet for a family there for a month.The kind of care Richard received is expensive, whether the new parents live in Hong Kong or elsewhere. One US  location, Boram Postnatal Retreat, opened last year in New York City.“It was very challenging to get the concept received by others,” cofounder Boram Nam told CNN. “It was a lot about the education process — information is abundant up to until you give birth, and the spotlight completely shifts over to the baby — so we get into that discussion, and people get it.”But her program comes with a hefty price tag, starting at three nights for $2700.“This is the price we do need to charge for the level of service that we provide within the guidelines of what postpartum care looks like in the US,” said Nam, adding that she hopes eventually to get services covered by insurance. “We want to make sure this can be accessible by others, by more women, a more diverse group of people.”Mandy Major, owner of Major Care, a virtual postpartum doula service based in the US, has noticed a lack of postpartum education in her country.“We have a lack of systematic postpartum here within our health care system,” Major said. “We have a go-go, hyper-productive, hyper-independent culture, but we also don’t have paid leave.”Richard’s mostly Western followers on YouTube noted that pressure, commenting on the luxury of taking a month off to spend time recovering and connecting with their babies.“As an American woman who has given birth 4 times and been booted immediately out of the hospital expected to figure it all out on my own, I can undoubtedly say had this been an option, it may have changed my whole mothering experiences!!” one person said.“I returned to work 2 weeks postpartum in America,” another mother wrote. “I never felt that I was able to fully bond with my child.”The month of confinement came to an end for Richard last April. In Richard’s YouTube video, Chan holds Levi one last time and passes him back to his mother as she put her shoes on to leave.Richard’s eyes begin to fill with tears, surprising herself at her emotional reaction.“I feel like I’m losing a family member,” she says as the door slowly closes behind Chan, according to the video.Even after the confinement experience, Chan remains close with Richard’s family, stopping by for lunch occasionally and still giving baby advice.“If I have another baby, I would love to have it in Canada with my family, but I want Carol to come with me if I do!” Richard said in a video chat later, smiling. “I can’t imagine going through this again without her.”",travel,0.0
177,182,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/25/health/best-drinks-for-hydration-wellness/index.html,Which drink is best for hydration? Hint: It isn’t water,2023-05-06 10:03:00,"When you’re thirsty and in need of a drink, which beverages are best at keeping you hydrated?Sure, you can always reach for a glass of water — but plain H20 isn’t the most hydrating beverage around, according to a study from Scotland’s St. Andrews University that compared the hydration responses of several different drinks.The researchers found that while water — both still and sparkling — does a pretty good job of quickly hydrating the body, beverages with a little bit of sugar, fat or protein do an even better job of keeping us hydrated for  longer.The reason has to do with how our bodies respond to beverages, according to Ronald Maughan, a professor at St. Andrews’ School of Medicine and the study’s author. One factor is the volume of a given drink: The more you drink, the faster the drink empties from your stomach and gets absorbed into the bloodstream, where it can dilute the body’s fluids and hydrate you.The other factor affecting how well a beverage hydrates relates to a drink’s nutrient composition. For example, milk was found to be even more hydrating than plain water because it contains the sugar lactose, some protein and some fat, all of which help to slow the emptying of fluid from the stomach and keep hydration happening over a longer period.Milk also has sodium, which acts like a sponge and holds onto water in the body and results in less urine produced.The same can be said for oral rehydration solutions that are used to treat diarrhea. Those contain small amounts of sugar, as well as sodium and potassium, which can also help promote water retention in the body.“This study tells us much of what we already knew: Electrolytes — like sodium and potassium — contribute to better hydration, while calories in beverages result in slower gastric emptying and therefore slower release of urination,” said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian, personal trainer and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who was not involved in the study.But here’s where it gets tricky: Beverages with more concentrated sugars, such as fruit juices or colas, are not necessarily as hydrating as their lower-sugar cousins. They may spend a little more time in the stomach and empty more slowly compared to plain water, but once these beverages enter the small intestine their high concentration of sugars gets diluted during a physiological process called osmosis. This process in effect “pulls” water from the body into the small intestine to dilute the sugars these beverages contain. And technically, anything inside the intestine is outside your body.Juice and soda are not only less hydrating, but offer extra sugars and calories that won’t fill us up as much as solid foods, explained Majumdar. If the choice is between soda and water for hydration, go with water every time. After all, our kidneys and liver depend on water to get rid of toxins in our bodies, and water also plays a key role in maintaining skin’s elasticity and suppleness. It’s the cheapest moisturizer you’ll find.While staying hydrated is important — doing so keeps our joints lubricated, helps prevent infections, and carries nutrients to our cells — in most situations people don’t need to worry too much about how hydrating their beverages are.“If you’re thirsty, your body will tell you to drink more,” Maughan said.  But for athletes training seriously in warm conditions with high sweat losses, or for someone whose cognitive function may be negatively impacted by working long hours without beverage breaks, hydration becomes a critical issue.Alcohol acts as a diuretic, which causes you to pass more urine, so when it comes to alcoholic beverages hydration will depend on a beverage’s total volume. “Beer would result in less water loss than whiskey, because you are ingesting more fluid with beer,” Maughan said.  “Strong alcoholic drinks will dehydrate, dilute alcoholic drinks will not.”When it comes to coffee, how well your java hydrates you will depend on the amount of caffeine you consume.  A regular coffee with about 80 milligrams of caffeine — roughtly what you would find in 12 oz. of Folgers’ house blend – would be pretty much as hydrating as water, according to Maughan’s research.Consuming more than 300mg of caffeine, or about 2-4 cups of coffee, could cause you to lose excess fluid as the caffeine causes a mild, short-term diuretic effect. This is more likely to happen with someone who doesn’t typically consume caffeine, and it could be offset by adding a tablespoon or two of milk to your cup of joe.",health,0.0
178,183,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/06/world/medieval-moon-observations-volcanic-eruptions-scn/index.html,Medieval moon observations reveal ‘mysterious’ volcanic eruptions,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Medieval observations of the moon are helping present-day researchers study a mysterious cluster of volcanic eruptions on Earth.Monks, and other scribes from the era, made detailed descriptions of lunar eclipses, when the moon is fully in Earth’s shadow. At the time, the events were thought to foretell calamities.Their writings often noted a reddish orb surrounding the eclipsed moon, as well as more unusual instances where the eclipsed moon seemed to disappear entirely from the sky.“The old folk had never seen it like this time, with the location of the disk of the Moon not visible, just as if it had disappeared during the eclipse… It was truly something to fear,” wrote Japanese poet Fujiwara no Teika, of an unprecedented dark eclipse observed on December 2, 1229.What the chroniclers could not have known was this: An exceptionally dark eclipse is associated with the presence of a large amount of volcanic dust in the atmosphere, according to Sébastien Guillet, a senior research associate at the Institute for Environmental Sciences at the University of Geneva.Guillet believes medieval manuscripts contain an important source of information about a string of large but little-understood volcanic eruptions on Earth.“Improving our knowledge of these otherwise mysterious eruptions is crucial to understanding whether and how past volcanism affected not only climate but also society during the Middle Ages,” Guillet said in a news release.Over a five-year period, Guillet and his colleagues scoured 12th and 13th-century European, Middle Eastern and East Asian sources for lunar descriptions, which —  when combined with ice core and tree ring data — are allowing more accurate dating of what scientists think must have been some of the biggest volcanic eruptions the world has seen.Of the 64 total lunar eclipses that occurred in Europe between 1100 and 1300, the study, published April 5 in the journal Nature, found documentation of 51. In six of these cases, these documents also reported that the moon was exceptionally dark — in May 1110, January 1172, December 1229, May 1258, November 1258 and November 1276.These dates correspond with five major volcanic eruptions identified from traces of volcanic ash found in polar ice cores — in 1108, 1171, 1230, 1257 and 1276.  (Of these, only the location of the 1257 eruption is known, at the Samalas volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok.)“These eruptions were significantly more powerful than some of the most well-known volcanic eruptions in recent history,” Guillet said. “One of these powerful eruptions, the 1257 Samalas eruption, stands as one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the past millennium.”“The resulting volcanic aerosols blocked sunlight and caused widespread climate disruption. Historical records show that the following summer in Europe… was one of the coldest summers recorded over the past millennium.”Researchers believe volcanic eruptions took place three to 20 months before the dark eclipses, based on observations of more recent eruptions and their effect on lunar eclipses.“We only knew about these eruptions because they left traces in the ice of Antarctica and Greenland,” said study coauthor Clive Oppenheimer, a professor at the University of Cambridge, in a news release.“By putting together the information from ice cores and the descriptions from medieval texts, we can now make better estimates of when and where some of the biggest eruptions of this period occurred.”Climate scientists usually identify past volcanic eruptions by measuring the amount — and acidity — of volcanic ash in cores drilled from polar ice, or by inferring abrupt temperature changes in tree ring records.However, these sources sometimes conflict, because volcanic eruptions disrupt weather patterns in different ways depending on their location, intensity and timing, said Andrea Seim, chair of Forest Growth and Dendroecology at the University of Freiburg’s Institute of Forest Sciences in Germany, and Eduardo Zorita, a senior scientist at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, a German research center, in a commentary that accompanied the study.“The strength of Guillet and co-workers’ study lies in the precision with which the authors estimated the timing of volcanic eruptions — pinpointing the year, and even in some cases the month, of the event,” the pair noted. Seim and Zorita were not involved in the research.The study said the new research would help to shed light on the onset of the Little Ice Age, a period of cold weather between 1280 and 1340 that disrupted harvests, saw the advance of European glaciers, and, according to some historians, led to a shift in the social and economic order.",health,0.0

A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.Glover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.Koch, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.NASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later.The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.“I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on inaugural missions.Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”An interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.",health,0.0

The research, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, revealed intriguing details about its ancient wearer and is the first time scientists have successfully isolated ancient human DNA from a Stone Age artifact.Excavated from Denisova Cave in southern Siberia, the pendant was worn by a woman who lived between 19,000 and 25,000 years ago, according to the analysis of human genetic material preserved in the pendant. She belonged to a group known as Ancient North Eurasians, which have a genetic connection to the first Americans.The new method will hopefully allow scientists to learn about the sex and genetic ancestry of the Stone Age makers, wearers and users of an array of bone tools and ornaments unearthed from digs around the world.“It’s amazing. It means that we’ll be able to answer very simple questions such as what tasks males and females were doing at that point time,” said study coauthor Marie Soressi, a professor and chair of human origins at Faculty of Archaeology of Leiden University in the Netherlands. “We actually will have a direct line of evidence to tell us.”The technique may also, for example, be able reveal whether a tool was used by a Neanderthal or our own Homo sapiens ancestors, she added.Human DNA was likely preserved in the deer bone pendant because it is porous and therefore more likely to retain genetic material present in skin cells, sweat and other body fluids.Typically, researchers would use a small drill to extract bone powder from an artifact or bone. Lead study author Elena Essel, a molecular biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in Leipzig, Germany, described the newly developed technique as a “laboratory washing machine without the movement.”The pendant was submerged in a sodium phosphate buffer solution while gradually increasing the temperature. This allowed the DNA to be released into the solution, where it was isolated, purified and sequenced using existing tools.“If we want to stay in this image of the washing machine, it’s the wash water that was exciting for us,” Essel explained.While bone tools and artifacts are rarer than stone ones, they are still much more common in the archaeological record than humans remains, opening up new avenues for research.The pendant study, however, is essentially a proof of concept, and it’s not clear how easy it will be to extract ancient human DNA from other bone ornaments and tools.The technique, at least as it stands, only worked on freshly excavated material and where archaeologists had taken steps to ensure that the artifact is “clean” — i.e. not contaminated with modern human DNA — by wearing gloves and a mask and making sure the object was sealed in a bag immediately after being unearthed.The technique didn’t identify ancient DNA when applied to a set of  bone tools from the French cave Quinçay excavated back in the 1970s to 1990s — when nobody had any idea that genetic material could be preserved for so long.Nor was it possible to extract ancient DNA from three freshly excavated tooth pendants from Bacho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria, home to some of the earliest known modern humans in Europe, according to the study.“Right now, it’s like this one sample. I would be really interested in learning more about how often we can can extract ancient human DNA and if it’s like a specific type of artifact that is more promising or if it works equally well for (bone) tools,” Essel said.It’s not known why the deer tooth pendant contained such a large amount of the ancient woman’s DNA (about the same amount as a human tooth) — perhaps it was well-loved and worn close to the skin for an exceptionally long period of time, Essel said.“How we think it works is that the longer there was close body contact, the higher the chances that a lot of DNA is in the material … but we have no idea if we’re talking about days or months or years or decades.”",health,0.0

Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as Pseudoliparis belyaevi – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.",health,0.0

Adam was not involved in the new study.“As adults, around the world, we take extra precautions when it comes to our children. We buckle them into car seats, make sure they wear helmets,” Adam said. “When it comes to packaged foods, the food industry is doing the opposite: actually promoting less healthy foods to the most vulnerable members of society.”And the problem might be even worse than the study shows. Mulligan noted that the study looked only at products in one point in time.“We are likely underestimating just how much marketing children are exposed to on food packages in real time — and packaging is just one of the ways that food companies target children with food marketing,” she said.A large body of research shows that children are marketed these products from all sides, whether that be on television or social media, at sports practice or at community centers — even at school, she said.“This is important for readers to understand, because seeing all of this marketing is impacting how children eat, and the poor dietary habits that kids are developing will carry forward throughout their lives and impact their health in the long term,” Mulligan said.The study was conducted in Canada, but the problem is global, Mulligan said.And governments will need to step in to regulate companies’ ability to target children directly when marketing products that can harm their health, she added.“These policies need to be strong and comprehensive so that they effectively protect children from these harmful marketing practices in all the places that kids live, eat and play,” Mulligan said.“It’s clear that product packages are used by companies to market their products to children. This is why groups like Heart and Stroke are calling for the inclusion of all types of marketing, not just television and digital media, in the regulations planned for Canada,” said Manuel Arango, director of health policy and advocacy with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.But in the meantime, there are ways to make changes at home, starting with becoming more aware of the ways children are being exposed to advertisements for products that could be harmful to them, she said.An easy way to start is by cooking more at home, Adam said.“For those meals, you control the amount of fat, sugar and salt in your children’s food,” she added.Cooking and eating at home is also shown to improve mental and emotional health and academic performance, Adam said.Mulligan recommends talking to kids about how companies use marketing and how it might influence their choices.“This can also be a great opportunity to get children involved in family grocery shopping and help them learn about how to choose, make and eat healthy, delicious foods,” she said.",health,0.0

Yet once your head hits the pillow, your mind is flooded with worry, making sleep elusive, at times impossible.Don’t fret, experts say: There are relaxation techniques you can use to calm that racing mind.“Think of these relaxation exercises as tools in your tool kit for better sleep,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School.“Practice them, and you’ll get better and better at falling asleep, which is the holy grail, right? No one wants to spend time tossing and turning at night.”Deep breathing is a science-backed method of calming the body and mind that can be done easily  before you get into bed and when you wake during the middle of the night.Changing the rhythm of your breath slows your heart rate, reduces blood pressure and stimulates the body’s parasympathetic “rest and digest” system, which can take worry and anxiety offline.“Consciously focusing on the breath can help you separate yourself from the darting thoughts that fly through your brain,” Robbins said.There are a number of deep breathing techniques you can try. Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, focuses on relaxing the diaphragm, the main muscle of respiration. Start by taking a deep breath through your nose to a slow count of six, making sure that you can feel your stomach rise with your hand as it fills with air. Count to six again as you let the breath slowly escape.“Strive for effortless inhales that are soft and soundless while treating your exhales like gentle, extended sighs of relief,” suggested CNN contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach.Stay in the moment, Santas said, by focusing on the sounds and sensations of your breath: “Direct all of your senses to follow the path of air in through your nose, down your throat, into your lungs and out again. If your mind wanders, bring it back to your breath, happening in the here and now.”Meditation is a centuries-old method of calming the body and the mind. Studies show it can help perfectionists stop judging themselves and can assist in the treatment of smoking, pain, addictive disorders and depression, among others.Using direct measures of brain function and structure, one study found it only took 30 minutes a day of meditation practice over the course of two weeks to produce a measurable change in the brain.“When these kinds of mental exercises are taught to people, it actually changes the function and the structure of their brain,” neuroscientist Richard Davidson, professor of psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the founder and director of the Center for Healthy Minds, told CNN in an earlier interview.There are many resources on the internet to help someone begin to meditate. Davidson and his colleagues have created a free, science-based app designed to help people practice meditation and mindfulness.Visualization is another sleep aid. Picture a calm and peaceful spot in your mind’s eye and fill it with specific objects, colors and sounds. Researchers have found that people who visualize in detail were able to push unwelcome thoughts more successfully from their minds.If you have trouble populating the scene, the researchers suggest asking yourself questions about smell, touch and light, such as “Can I feel the sun on my skin? What do I smell in the air?”You can also visualize your body relaxing, experts say. While breathing deeply and slowly, imagine your breath is a wind coursing through the body, easing stress and relaxing tension as it moves through each part of the body and then escapes.“I like to think of the breath as a light in your mind’s eye that grows when you inhale and gets smaller as you exhale,” Robbins said. “Those tangible strategies where you visualize something and match that to a breath are really powerful.”Most of us aren’t even aware of how much tension we carry in our muscles until it shows up in backaches and headaches.Progressive muscle relaxation is a way of relaxing those muscles, thus making it easier to fall asleep, experts say. You tense and release muscle groups in the body in a certain order, starting at the head and working your way down to the toes and feet.Each section of the body is tightly tensed and held for 10 seconds as you breathe in. Strive to squeeze each muscle hard, but not to the point of cramping or pain. Then, as you breathe out, relax the muscle suddenly and all at once. University of Michigan Health recommends you do the exercises in a systematic order that you can find here.There’s an added benefit to the exercise, experts say: There’s no room in your brain for anxious thoughts.Here’s a way to stop your mind from repetitively listing all the things you need to do (or haven’t done), but it only works if you do it before you hit the sack.“Don’t worry in bed. Schedule a ‘worry time’ – a period of time outside of the bedroom, outside of sleep, to worry about the things that naturally creep in your mind at night,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.“Write down a list of things you need to do tomorrow,” suggested Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, a professor of medicine and director of sleep research at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.“You can even email it to yourself. It gives you satisfaction and the realization that it is night and there’s nothing you can do with your list, but you can attend to it tomorrow,” Polotsky said.All these mental tricks and relaxation tips serve a purpose beyond that night’s sleep, experts say.“They are extremely beneficial from a classical conditioning standpoint,” Robbins said. “If your body knows what comes after the end of these activities is sleep, then you start to condition yourself, and after a bit of time, your body will more easily slip into a state of relaxation, which increases your chances of sleep.”",health,0.0
184,189,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/28/health/spring-cleaning-body-wellness/index.html,Reset your body and mind with 10 ‘spring-cleaning’ tips,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","With the weather warming up, you might feel inspired to clean out your closets, wash your windows and give your house a deep scrub and reorganization. Not only is a clean environment good for your physical health, but research has shown that the good feelings you get from having a clean, uncluttered home reduce stress levels and ward off depression.Imagine how great you would feel if you took that same spring-cleaning approach to your body — your living, breathing home.Of course, you should already be subscribing to annual checkups with your primary care physician and eye doctor, and you may even see your dentist biannually. But what about taking a closer look at how you fuel and move your body — and making healthy changes to clean up those areas?As a mind-body coach in professional sports, I work with coaches, medical staff and expert consultants every year during baseball spring training to help players prepare their bodies for the season. In addition to conducting annual physicals, we do nutritional and movement assessments to create appropriate action plans.You may not be a professional athlete, but your body is still the vehicle used to navigate your life, and the quality of its ability to move and how well you feel in it affects the overall quality of your life.That’s why I enlisted the help of two nutrition and human movement experts to provide 10 “spring-cleaning” tips to avoid injury, move pain-free, reduce inflammation, maintain a healthy weight and generally feel better in your body.Important note: It’s recommended to consult your doctor before starting any new exercise programs or dietary changes.You might expect a cleanse to be tip No. 1, but think twice before you dive into one of the many  popular advertised cleanses. A lot of them can “do more harm than good,” according to registered dietitian Angie Asche, owner of Eleat Sports Nutrition and author of “Fuel Your Body: How to Cook and Eat for Peak Performance.” Asche said cleanses can be dehydrating and contain herbal supplements with potentially negative side effects and contraindications with certain medications. What’s more, some of these regimens don’t deliver on their promise, according to the National Institutes of Health. “Most are missing key nutrients that are necessary for your body to naturally detoxify,” she explained.Fiber, found in plant foods, is the key to safe and efficient cleansing, according to Asche. She advises eating five to nine fruits and vegetables daily for bowel regularity and weight management. “Not only do plant foods like nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, fruit and vegetables contain antioxidants,” Asche said, “but the more variety of plants we have in our diets, the better for the diversity of our gut biome.”With your focus on eating more real, whole foods rich in fiber, Asche also recommends limiting ultraprocessed packaged foods such as cookies, candy, crackers, baked goods and fried foods. These foods are full of saturated fat, sodium, sugar and preservatives while being devoid of nutritional value.How much water you drink affects all the functions of your body — including your mental performance; a body water loss of just 1% to 2% can impair cognitive function. To promote good health and weight management, Asche advises drinking at least half your body weight in ounces daily but said the amount can vary depending on a person’s activity level.Asche said that most fluids, including tea, coffee and carbonated water, can count toward your water intake, but she points out that alcohol does not — and should be limited. “In large amounts, alcohol can overwhelm the gut, promoting intestinal inflammation and increasing harmful bacteria … (which) can lead to a wide range of health problems,” she said.Screens that look at your ability to do functional movements, such as squatting and lunging, are a great way to proactively prevent injury, according to physical therapist Gray Cook, a cofounder of Functional Movement Systems.“Signs of weakness, tightness and balance problems can be early indicators of arthritis and posture issues as well as increased injury risk for athletes and fall risk for the elderly,” Cook said.You can get the assistance of a physical therapist or qualified trainer to perform a movement assessment, but a recent study showed that self-movement assessment (using an app codeveloped by Cook) is valid and reliable for identifying musculoskeletal risk factors.Whether working with professional athletes or doing my own workouts, I ensure that I cover all primary functional movements in all planes of motion in every training session. Executing that kind of total-body workout sounds more complicated than it is. It’s simply about practicing and strengthening your ability to perform your body’s basic movement functions: squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling, rotating and stabilizing your core.And, just like the multidirectional movement of everyday life, it helps to exercise in all three planes of motion: sagittal (forward/backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotating). You can easily practice these movements with a body-weight workout or yoga flow.The key to exercise’s effectiveness is consistency. With as little as 11 minutes of exercise per day, you can enjoy numerous health benefits — including increasing your life span. Walking outside is a great way to get in those 11 minutes daily, and because of the alternating and reciprocal nature of gait, it offers the opportunity to tune into your body and self-assess by noticing if there are any imbalances.Breathing plays a vital role in how you think, feel and move. In addition to reducing your heart rate, blood pressure and stress response, learning how to breathe better will improve your diaphragm function and rib mobility, which can improve posture and reduce back pain. Practice taking breathing breaks a few minutes throughout your day.Sleep is essential for overall health. Adults need at least seven hours of sleep nightly, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you’re not getting that minimum amount of shut-eye, it’s time to clean up your sleep routine and start prioritizing rest.Just like the physical and mental benefits of traditional spring-cleaning within your home, these 10 tips will refresh and revitalize your body and mind in noticeably positive ways.",health,0.0
185,190,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/27/health/best-diets-heart-aha-wellness/index.html,"Yes, you can eat your way to heart health. Here’s how","09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Heart disease is the leading killer of men and women worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, but there are ways to significantly reduce your risk.Along with regular exercise and not smoking, a healthy diet is a key way to keep heart disease at bay. But which diet best meets the dietary guidelines of the American Heart Association?In a new scientific statement, leading experts in nutrition ranked 10 popular diets on their ability to meet the AHA’s evidence-based dietary guidance for heart health, published in 2021.The winner? The DASH diet, which was 100% aligned with AHA goals for heart-healthy eating. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; high blood pressure is a major contributor to heart disease and stroke.The pescatarian diet, which allows dairy, eggs, fish and other seafood but no meat or poultry, was 92% aligned with the AHA guidelines. The lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, which allows dairy and eggs, and variations that include one or the other, were 86% aligned.The award-winning Mediterranean diet was 89% aligned with the AHA dietary recommendations. The popular diet came in third mostly because it recommends a small glass of red wine each day and doesn’t limit salt, said lead author Christopher Gardner, a research professor of medicine at the Stanford Prevention Research Center in California who directs its Nutrition Studies Research Group.“The American Heart Association says no one should drink alcohol if they haven’t started,” Gardner said. “And if they do drink, to do so minimally.”Research has linked the Mediterranean diet to reduced risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer as well as weight loss, stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life.But all of these diets share so much in common they can really be grouped together as a top “tier” of eating patterns, Gardner said.“We basically were trying to say a diet doesn’t have to be 100 to be good,” he said. “All of the diets in the top tier are plant-based, and if they are off base a bit aren’t hard to fix. Paleo and keto, however, really can’t be fixed. You’d have to completely overhaul them.”Very low-carb diets, such as Atkins, and various keto diets, such as the well-formulated ketogenic diet, or WFKD, were in the bottom tier of heart-healthy eating patterns, due to their emphasis on red meat, whole dairy and saturated fats, as well as limited fruit and vegetable intake.A vegan diet that incorporated more than 10% fat and low-fat diets such as volumetrics were in the second tier — both met 78% of the AHA dietary guidelines, according to the statement.Very low-fat diets with less than 10% fat, which applies to some vegan lifestyles (72%), and low-carb diets such as South Beach, Zone and the low-glycemic index (64%) were less aligned and made up the third tier of diets.While people concerned with heart health can and should use the new AHA ranking of the 10 diets, the scientific statement was written for physicians, Gardner said. The goal is to get doctors up to speed, since nutrition is not often prioritized in medical school.“It’s a cheat sheet for doctors,” Gardner said. “When they do ask about diet — which I don’t think is all that often — and a patient says, ‘Oh, yeah, I’m paleo. I’m vegan. I’m keto or I’m DASH,’ I don’t think they really know what that means.”That’s absolutely true, said preventive cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health, a hospital in Denver.“We surveyed 1,000 cardiologists five or six years ago, and it turns out about 90% of us know almost nothing about nutrition,” said Freeman, who was not involved with developing the AHA statement.Yet patients need their doctors to be discussing nutrition with them during regular checkups, Freeman added.“If you asked me in my heart of hearts do I think we should have been banging the drum about nutrition for the last 100 years? Yes. So every time we can bang the drum a little more, I’m always in favor,” he said.Now, with a color-coded chart in hand, doctors will be better informed to discuss the foods on those diets and which to emphasize, limit or avoid, Gardner said. Instead of talking about the benefits of specific heart-healthy nutrients and foods, advice should focus on a overall pattern of eating.“When it was a single heart-healthy nutrient, you could just inject that nutrient into food and claim it’s healthy food, which it wasn’t,” he said. “Or if there’s a superfood like chia seeds, you could take a really unhealthy food and sprinkle chia seeds on it and say, ‘Ah, I’m now protected.’ No, it needs to be part of an overall healthy pattern of foods.”To that point, Gardner stressed that each diet in the rankings was evaluated as it was intended to be eaten, not as people might actually do in real life. The new statement provides information on how doctors might counsel patients who are not eating as optimally as possible, either due to cost, lack of time or other stresses.However, fixing those concerns may take more than individual willpower, Freeman said.“It’s hard to adhere to a diet in a society which allows ultraprocessed comfort foods like bacon-on-a-stick to be the norm, and asking society to change a major tenant of everyday living is going to be very challenging,” he said.“But I would also tell you the plant-based food movement is the fastest-growing food movement in the country,” he said. “So there’s hope.”",health,0.0
186,191,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/07/health/healthiest-cheese-wellness/index.html,"What’s the healthiest cheese? The best options, according to experts","09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Cheese – what’s not to love? Its popularity is indisputable.Americans consumed over 39 pounds of cheese per capita in 2021 alone, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture.Whether eating cheese is healthy — that’s a little less clear.High in protein, calcium, vitamins and essential amino acids, cheese is also a calorie-dense food, and can be high in fats and sodium.“If you enjoy cheese and you like it, it could be a good source of protein. It could be a good source of calcium. You just want to eat it where you’re not overindulging too much, because it can quickly add up in terms of calories,” Lourdes Castro Mortillaro, a registered dietician and the director of the NYU Food Lab, told CNN.The protein found in cheese is a good alternative to protein derived from flesh, because it is still of animal origin, and contains all the essential amino acids the body needs but can’t synthesize on its own, according to Castro Mortillaro.This makes cheese a complete protein, she added.However, as with all things nutrition, it’s the overall balance of what you eat day to day that should inform how much cheese you consume, Castro Mortillaro explained.“You really have to see it in the context of, what else is going on in your life? And what else are you putting on your plate?” she said. “You don’t need that much to gain the positives from it.”Which cheese is healthiest? The answer depends on your specific body and its nutritional needs, but here are some pointers from experts.Both Castro Mortillaro and Emily Martorano, a registered dietitian with NYU Langone’s weight management program, agree on ricotta being a winner in the healthfulness department.The name of the cheese translates to “cooked-again,” and Castro Mortillaro explained that authentic ricotta is produced by treating the whey that is leftover after milk (such as sheep’s milk) is coagulated to produce cheese (such as pecorino).Ricotta has a high concentration of whey protein, which is easily absorbed by the body.“Whey protein is one of the most absorbable forms of protein and it contains a very wide range of amino acids,” Martorano said. “So this is the best bet for someone who’s looking to build muscle, build strength while also losing fat and weight.”Castro Mortillaro also pointed to ricotta’s potential sustainability benefits, as it puts to use the leftover byproducts of cheesemaking.“That’s very Tuscan,” she added.Castro Mortillaro believes harder cheeses such as Parmigiano, pecorino or gouda are also among the healthiest options, when consumed in moderation.Because they contain less water and are more concentrated, “hard cheeses are going to be higher in calcium, and you’re probably going to be satiated with smaller amounts, so you tend to not to over-consume,” she said.However, because they are more concentrated, harder cheeses also might have a higher sodium content than softer ones.“If you’re hypertensive, or you really need to control your sodium intake, or maybe you have renal issues, then probably going for a softer cheese would be better,” Castro Mortillaro said.If you’re watching your weight, protein is the name of the game. It keeps you full longer, and helps you build muscle.Cheeses that are rich in protein and lower in fat are great options for folks looking to manage their weight, Martorano said.A good way to determine which cheeses fall in this category is to consider a 1:10 ratio of protein to calories, according to Martorano.“For every 100 calories, there should be at least 10 grams of protein – that will tell you if it’s a good source of protein and in turn a healthier cheese,” she explained.Some cheeses that she recommended based on this are light Swiss cheese, light cheddar cheese and ricotta.If possible, steer clear of the highly processed stuff, including cheese in a can, individually wrapped slices and those blocks that don’t even need to be refrigerated.“Squeezable cheese, American cheese, even cream cheese, provide minimal protein for a much higher fat and sodium content,” Martorano said.Some of the processed cheese varietals are not even technically classified as “cheeses” by the US Food and Drug Administration, but as “pasteurized process cheese foods” or “pasteurized process cheese products,” depending on the percentage of actual cheese they contain along with other ingredients.“Fresh is always better,” according to Martorano.Dietary trends come and go, and Castro Mortillaro remembers the “fat-free phase” in the 1990s and early 2000s.“We had fat-free cheese and fat-free mayonnaise, and all this other kind of stuff, and it was just highly processed,” she said.Castro Mortillaro thinks that unless your specific goal is to lose weight, full-fat cheese should have a place in your diet.“It’s better to have a smaller amount of something that is just more wholesome, if you’re in that neutral category, and enjoy it,” she said.Some cheeses can also be a good source of probiotics, according to Martorano, who pointed to feta, goat cheese and cheese made from raw or unpasteurized milk as great options.The artisanal cheese varieties, however, can cost a pretty penny.“Not everyone can afford to buy the most fancy cheese. When it comes to packaged cheeses, they’re all fine in moderation,” Martorano said.It’s best to think of cheese as a flavoring agent rather than as a meal in itself, according to both Martorano and Castro Mortillaro.“Instead of using cheese as the main source of nutrients, it really is a side,” Martorano told CNN.“If we’re pairing that cheese with something else – a vegetable, a whole grain – that’s what’s going to make it more of a satisfying, filling meal,” she explained.Ricotta for breakfast, paired with some oatmeal and fruit, could be a healthy start to the day, Martorano suggested.An afternoon snack with Swiss cheese and vegetables, or a whole grain cracker, would also be a good idea, she said.Ultimately, unless there are specific concerns you need to keep in mind, the healthiest cheese is your favorite one, enjoyed sparingly as the delicious occasional treat that it should be.“At the end of the day, if there’s a cheese that someone likes and they want to have it in moderation, it’s better to have the one that you like. So always pick the one you enjoy the most,” Martorano said.",travel,0.0
187,192,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/26/health/physical-activity-addiction-wellness/index.html,"Adding exercise into treatment may reduce substance use, study shows","09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","One key to fighting addiction may be exercise, according to a new study.Researchers undertook a review of the existing literature around physical activity and its relationship to substance use, and they found that regular exercise was associated with lowered use in about 75% of the studies investigating that question, according to the analysis.The review, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE, looked at 43 studies with more than 3,000 total participants. In addition to a reduction or cessation in substance use, the studies also found improved markers of physical health and decreased depressive symptoms, the study said.“People think that during treatment people should only do psychotherapeutic treatments … but that’s not what we’ve seen in our study,” said lead study author Florence Piché, a doctoral student and researcher at Université de Montréal in Canada. “It’s very beneficial to do physical activity in addition to the treatments.”There are limitations to the findings. The review found that most of the studies the researchers examined had a high risk of bias, meaning more research is needed to confirm their findings, said Dr. Aaron Kandola, research fellow at Medical Research Council Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at University College London.The studies were also not directly comparable enough to build a comprehensive and generalizable understanding of the relationship, Kandola said in an email. Kandola was not part of the research.However, the findings were still significant and useful, he added.“Substance use disorders are a major public health problem lacking low-cost, evidence-based solutions,” he said, adding that substance use disorders are worsening in many high-income countries — including the United States.Finding more accessible solutions to this disorder is especially important because it often occurs with other mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, which disproportionately affect people with fewer socioeconomic resources and areas with higher deprivation, he said.Physical activity may be a useful and accessible part of a treatment plan for substance use disorder, said Dr. Mark Smith, professor of psychology at Davidson College in North Carolina. Smith was not part of the research.“I think there’s now a sufficient amount of data to indicate that various forms of physical activity and exercise are generally effective at reducing substance use in individuals seeking treatment,” he said.Most people can benefit from engaging in physical activity, Kandola said.One benefit the studies found is improvements in physical health such as cardiovascular endurance or muscle strength, Smith said. And although that may not be the primary goal of the research, he said this finding is important because it shows the physical activity is doing its job to promote physical health.The research also showed physical activity to be linked with increased self-efficacy, self-esteem and self-confidence, which are known to be protective against substance use, Smith added.And there’s more: Physical activity has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, which are major risk factors for substance use, Kandola said.Why might a little sweat go such a long way? Exercise produces dramatic changes throughout the brain, Smith said.When you exercise, you are engaging neural pathways that are also affected by substance use. There is a lot of evidence that exercise can help to normalize the changes that occur to those pathways when using substances, Smith added.Although the recent study highlighted the benefits of exercise, it did not find an amount or intensity at which a person needs to exercise to see the benefits, Smith said.The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans does recommend that adults get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and two days of muscle-strengthening activity.Take our workout quizAnother question that needs to be asked: Does more exercise mean more benefit?Even without solid answers to those questions, it is a good idea for people with all kinds of health concerns to start, Kandola said.If you don’t have an exercise habit already, start light with light activities like brief walks around the block, he said.“Small amounts of physical activity are still beneficial and help you to build your fitness by gradually increasing duration and intensity over time,” Kandola said. “The biggest health benefits are seen in people moving from low to medium levels of physical fitness.”Your exercise should also be fun, Smith said. Liking what you are doing is a great way to reduce substance use.“If you give individuals an alternative activity that they enjoy, then by default, substance use will decrease. They have something else to do with their time,” Smith said.“Now, this doesn’t necessarily have to be, you know, running for hours on a treadmill. You know, it could be going outside and playing basketball or tennis or pickleball, or whatever your favorite sport is,” he added.“It may require some trial and error, but finding the right type of physical activity (or activities) for you will increase the chances of sticking with it for longer,” Kandola said in an email. “It can also be a good way to meet new people or explore new areas.”",health,0.0
188,193,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/24/health/fried-food-anxiety-depression-risk-wellness/index.html,New research suggests that french fries may be linked to depression,"09:37 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","French fries — they’re greasy, starchy and a comfort food for many.But reaching for fried foods may have a negative impact on mental health.A research team in Hangzhou, China, found that frequent consumption of fried foods, especially fried potatoes, was linked with a 12% higher risk of anxiety and 7% higher risk of depression than in people who didn’t eat fried foods.The link was more pronounced among young men and younger consumers.Fried foods are known risk factors for obesity, high blood pressure and other health effects. These results “open an avenue in the significance of reducing fried food consumption for mental health,” according to the paper published Monday in the journal PNAS.However, experts who study nutrition said the results are preliminary, and it’s not necessarily clear whether the fried foods were driving mental health issues, or people experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety turned to fried foods.The study evaluated 140,728 people over 11.3 years. After excluding participants diagnosed with depression within the first two years, a total of 8,294 cases of anxiety and 12,735 cases of depression were found in those that consumed fried food, while specifically fried potatoes were found to have a 2% increase in risk of depression over fried white meat.The study had also found that the participants consuming more than one serving of fried food regularly were more likely to be younger men.“The human component of this study may indicate just what it purports: that higher intake of fried food increases the risk of anxiety/depression,” said Dr. David Katz, a lifestyle medicine specialist who was not involved in the study, via email.“However, the causal pathway could just as readily go the other way: people with anxiety/depression turn to ‘comfort food’ with increasing frequency for some semblance of relief,” added Katz, founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.Those with underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression could turn to comfort foods as a way of self-medicating, he said.Unhealthy food and poor nutrition can lower one’s mood and progress a mental health condition, as found in a prior study cited within this new one.In the new study, the researchers suggest that acrylamide, a chemical formed during the frying process, especially in fried potatoes, is to blame for the higher risk of anxiety and depression.In a separate paper referenced in the new study, the researchers exposed zebrafish to the chemical, finding that long-term exposure had caused the fish to dwell in dark zones within the tank, a common sign of a higher anxiety level in the fish.The zebrafish had also displayed a reduced ability to explore their tanks and socialize, as they did not swim closely with other zebrafish, even though zebrafish are known to form schools with their species.“Zebrafish were presumably chosen … because they were already known to be vulnerable to acrylamide toxicity, and because their behavioral responses to anxiety are established and consistent — offering a source of both biological and behavioral data,” Katz said.Dr. Walter Willett said the results “should be regarded as very preliminary, especially the connection with fried food and acrylamide.”“The health effects of fried food will depend greatly on what food is fried and what type of fat is used for frying,” said Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, via email. “Potatoes are a concern for possible effects of mood because they can cause large surges in blood sugar and then hormonal responses to these surges. However, these surges are partly blunted by fat, which would be provided by the fat from frying.”Willett also noted that acrylamide isn’t only produced by frying. It’s in coffee, because of the roasting of the beans, and in toast, because “heating carbohydrates together with protein can do this.”He also said that the zebrafish “data are hard to interpret in relation to human health because we are obviously quite different, and the authors recognized this.”Zhejiang University researcher Yu Zhang, an author of the study, told CNN in an email that “there is no need to panic about the adverse effects of fried food.” But maintaining a healthy lifestyle and reducing consumption of fried foods may be helpful for mental health in additional to overall health.The researchers had pointed to a recent rise in depression and anxiety worldwide, with 2020 seeing an increase of 27.6% and 25.6%, respectively. The World Health Organization also estimates that more than 5% of adults suffer from depression, globally, as noted in the paper.By looking at the effects of fried food consumption in humans and acrylamide exposure in zebrafish, the researchers had compared the two to suggest that frequent consumption of the chemical commonly found in fried food could have a negative effect on mental health.A lack of variety in food has also been shown to decrease well-being, according to Katz.“If a take-away is needed it is simply that overall diet quality, and the selection of wholesome foods, matters profoundly to every aspect of health — mental and physical alike,” Katz said.Willett said there’s also the possibility of reverse causation — that people may change their diets because they have depression or anxiety. “These mood changes are, in general, more difficult to study because they may come and go, unlike the diagnosis of a major cancer or heart attack, the study in this analysis was not designed to address these challenges,” he said.",health,0.0

Rose",2023-05-02 06:40:00,"Come spring, avid gardeners dig into the new growing season ready with careful cultivation plans they dreamed up over long winters. But even city-dwelling non-planners can benefit from year-round botanical bounty. They just need to learn what, where and how to harvest the wild foods growing in lawns, parks and scrubby backlots.Chickweed, dandelion and dock provide delicious, nutrient-rich greens, while daylilies, lilacs, honeysuckle and roses can add floral overtones to syrups, jellies and baked goods. Protein-packed wild plants and plant parts include purslane, acorns and brown dock seeds. Teas and tinctures made from ground ivy, gingko and golden rod, along with many other “weeds” and invasive species, can serve various medicinal purposes, once properly prepared.In her book “Urban Foraging: Find, Gather, and Cook 50 Wild Plants,” herbalist and expert forager Lisa M. Rose offers guidance on safely identifying, gathering and preparing edible flora that grow wild in most major US cities.“Gathering your own food to make dinner can help instill a sense of place,” she said. She maintains that highlighting the role of wild plants in our food system can teach us to heal our soil, our waterways and our own public health. In this way, urban foraging creates new potential for greener, healthier and more sustainable ecosystems.This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.CNN: What makes you so passionate about urban foraging?Lisa M. Rose: “Oh my gosh, you can EAT those?” pretty much sums up the thrill of urban foraging. Showing people all the edible plants that grow in cities helps connect them with the natural world.It’s revolutionary to think differently of the unloved weeds and see opportunity in the neglected spaces that people pass by. The most fun, engaging thing is to get back outside and reconnect with the happiness that a dandelion flower can bring. Reinhabiting our 8-year-old, judgment-free selves allows us to recognize an elemental, earthly kind of beauty without the preconceived notions.Plus, wild plants have a unique function in the ecosystem. Even so-called invasive species can remediate the soil and water. They help to repair areas that have been leveled and left open to erosion by creating a structure that keeps the soil from blowing away. Soil is the building block of human health, and it needs a rich, diverse base of organic material to be able to give us nutritious food.CNN: What safety precautions do you recommend for people foraging in cities?Rose: My family is from Flint, Michigan. I take soil and water contamination issues very seriously. The first steps to safe urban foraging are knowing where to harvest — including researching the history of the land, if possible — and learning which plants and plant parts may be more likely to contain contaminants like heavy metals or pollutants.Nettles, for example, are apt to take up heavy metals like lead. So, I recommend harvesting these only from places free of soil contamination. The key is to take caution and be judicious. But remember, given the realities of our industrialized food system, the plants available at a commercial supermarket often have layers of pesticides. We don’t live in a perfect world.Also, it sounds silly, but when it comes to plants or mushrooms, if you don’t know what it is, don’t pick it, and definitely don’t put it in your mouth!CNN: What does it mean to forage responsibly? How can we take from while taking care of the land?Rose: As you observe an environment and learn what plants could be edible, make the effort to learn further: Is this endangered? Threatened? An invasive species? We want to consider, ethically, the plant’s distribution and the habitat.I rarely feel badly when I pick my garlic mustard. It’s going to come back. But when it comes to foraging by greengrocers and restaurants, it’s important to consider that there’s only so much the ecosystems can offer at that retail level. Where are these items coming from? How do I ensure no habitat destruction happens under the name of foraging trends? We have a long way to go in creating regionally based food systems that would help all of us, including our restaurants and grocers.CNN: How do community health and food justice concerns fit into foraging?Rose:  It’s impossible to decouple social justice from human health. Food-system inequities have a massive impact on access to nutrients and effects on human health.About 10% of the US population faces food insecurity — a wicked problem that foraging, gardening and local food systems cannot solve alone. But, restoring foodways — even simply refining how to cook basic things — can play a powerful part in increasing food access. Urban foraging is an effort to democratize the wild plants to make them more available to more people. You don’t have to be classically trained as a botanist at university. These are basic human skills.CNN: How much could we rely on urban foraging to feed ourselves?Rose: Not significantly, given the current populations and designs of our cities. It’s inconceivable and unethical for me to suggest that all of Manhattan go and use Central Park as their greengrocer. But intentionally designing more green space can create the possibility for more available food for city communities within a smaller footprint.CNN: Can you forage year-round?Rose: Yes! Harvesting must be done in context of your growing zone, of course, but part of the endeavor is to recognize what your landscape can provide. Even on frigid January and February days, foragers can find bark, buds and sap. Consider how, for millennia, indigenous communities supported a basic diet with fresh and stored wild foods. In many traditions, for example, acorns — high in carbohydrates and protein — played a significant role in helping to extend harvests to provide food for the winter.Acorns are a quintessential forager’s food that can be used in soups, pulverized into a nut butter or ground into flour for baking. Every fall, I process enough acorns to make 10 to 15 pounds of flour, with the help of neighbors who drop off bags full or team up to shell them while we chat over cocktails and cheese. Later, we share the acorn bread I bake, which is kind of my signature.Recipe: Acorn BreadMakes 1 loafIngredientsInstructionsPrepare the flourBake the breadCNN: How does the climate crisis factor into urban foraging?Rose: We’ve arrived at a big crossroads. At no other time has our human population had to face and address a rapidly changing climate across the globe. This affects our water systems, our food systems, even determining where we can live — as evidenced by migrations of people moving away from the shores of lakes and oceans.Urban foraging for wild plants helps us rethink how we live alongside the natural world, looking at habitat loss. We can learn a lot simply by honing our ability to observe the little dandelion or the patch of cattails along the riverside. How might we add back our green spaces that can build soil, support the biodiversity that we need and bring forward our pollinators?You can’t be what you don’t see. If you don’t have a connection to the water, a farmers market, a vegetable garden or to considering what that dandelion might be doing in the soil, how could you ever become a climate-conscious Earth protector, a steward of the ecosystem?Foraging helps us pay closer attention, which helps us to reestablish a more caring and less extractive relationship with the natural world.",travel,0.0
190,195,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/health/gold-medal-flour-salmonella/index.html,CDC identifies Gold Medal flour as source of salmonella outbreak,2023-05-01 19:05:00,"Investigators have identified Gold Medal flour as the source of a salmonella outbreak that has infected at least 13 people in 12 states, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.General Mills announced last week that it’s recalling 2-, 5- and 10-pound bags of bleached and unbleached all-purpose Gold Medal flour that have a “better if used by date” of March 27 or 28, 2024.Of eight people interviewed by health officials, seven reported eating raw dough or batter, the CDC said. “All six people who remembered the brand of flour they used reported Gold Medal All-Purpose Flour, and [the US Food and Drug Administration] found the outbreak strain in Gold Medal flour collected from a General Mills facility in Missouri.”Three people have been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak, but no deaths have been reported. The CDC notes that the true number of illnesses is probably higher because some people who recover without medical care don’t get tested for salmonella and because it usually takes weeks to link illnesses with an outbreak.Salmonella usually causes diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps within six hours to six days of consuming the bacteria. Most people recover without treatment within a week, but those who are younger, who are older or who have weakened immune systems may develop severe illness.Consumers who have the recalled flour should throw it away or return it to the point of purchase, and wash any surfaces or containers that may have come into contact with it.General Mills spokesperson Mollie Wulff said in a statement last week, “We are continuing to educate consumers that flour is not a ‘ready to eat’ ingredient. Anything made with flour must be cooked or baked before eating.”Most flour is raw and hasn’t been treated to kill germs that cause food poisoning, according to the CDC. Salmonella bacteria dies when it is cooked or baked, but people can get sick when eating or tasting foods that include raw flour. Raw dough used for crafts and play clay also pose a risk.The CDC advises baking or cooking any foods made with any brand of raw flour before eating. Thoroughly wash hands, bowls, utensils and surfaces after using raw flour. If making play dough at home, use heat-treated flour.",health,0.0
191,196,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/health/michigan-fungal-infection/index.html,More than 100 cases of rare fungal infection linked to Michigan paper mill,2023-05-01 14:56:00,"Health officials in Michigan said 109 cases of the rare fungal infection blastomycosis have been linked to a paper mill in Escanaba, an increase of five cases since the last update a week ago.Among the 109 cases, 13 have been hospitalized, and one death was previously reported. All the cases are among employees, contractors or visitors to the Billerud Paper Mill, according to Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties. Billerud idled mill operations last month to allow additional cleaning and said in a statement Monday that it’s targeting a May 8 startup date.Although the number of blastomycosis cases has increased since the previous update, that doesn’t necessarily mean exposures are ongoing, the county health departments said Friday. Since the incubation period for blastomycosis can range from 21 to 90 days, “it is likely all cases had an exposure prior to the mill idling operations,” the agencies said.“While we continue to see new cases testing positive for blastomycosis and being reported to Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties, we continue to see fewer new cases being reported each week and many of these cases have been showing signs and symptoms since March,” department health officer Michael Snyder said in a statement.Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is predominantly found in the Midwest and the South, particularly around the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes.There are only 1 or 2 cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, according to the CDC. One analysis found 1,216 deaths related to the illness from 1990 to 2010.People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won’t get sick, some will develop symptoms such as fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC said. Other symptoms can include chest pain, trouble breathing, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and muscle or joint pain, according to local health officials. In rare cases, the infection can spread outside the lungs to places such as the skin, bones, brain and spinal cord.Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person. It’s treated with antifungal medication that must be taken for a period ranging from six months to a year, depending on the severity of the illness and the person’s overall health.",health,0.0
192,197,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/health/free-covid-tests-phe-wellness/index.html,"Free Covid-19 tests aren’t guaranteed after May 11, but there’s still time to stock up",2023-05-01 07:22:00,"When the US Covid-19 public health emergency ends this month, coronavirus tests will still be available, but there will be changes to who pays for them.Questions remain about exactly what those coverage changes will look like, but the guarantee of free testing will be lost for many – and some costs may shift to become out-of-pocket.There are still ways to take advantage of the benefits provided by the public health emergency before it expires May 11.For the past two years, the federal government has required private insurance companies to cover up to eight Covid-19 tests each month. Packs of home tests can be found at pharmacies and other local retailers, and costs may be covered upfront or reimbursed by insurance plans.The Biden administration launched COVIDtests.gov in January 2022 to allow US households to order free Covid-19 test kits to be delivered to home. The site is still up and running, with four free tests available to any household that hasn’t ordered since December.Also, the US Food and Drug Administration has extended the expiration date for many home tests beyond what is printed on the box. Check the agency’s website before throwing them out.“People should go out and ensure that they have tests available, because what we know about Covid is it’s quite pernicious, and clearly, people can get it more than once,” said Mara Aspinall, a professor at Arizona State University’s College of Health Solutions and a testing and diagnostics expert.“It’s critical that people have the ability to test and then isolate or stay at home if they test positive.”Once the public health emergency ends, Covid-19 tests – both home tests and laboratory tests – will be subject to cost sharing, in which costs of services are divided between the patient and their insurance plan.Private insurers will no longer be required to cover the costs of testing. The federal government has encouraged continued coverage, but each company will ultimately be able to make their own decision. So far, details on those plans are scarce.The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association told CNN that it’s evaluating the best way to keep members informed of changes. Moving into the next phase, coverage may include “reasonable limits” on tests.“As COVID-19 becomes endemic, each Blue Cross and Blue Shield company is looking at how best to support access to diagnostic testing for COVID-19, just as is done for all other diagnostic testing,” said David Merritt, senior vice president of policy and advocacy for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. “We are committed to protecting patients from unnecessary costs, while ensuring they receive the care they need, when they need it.”Aetna told CNN that it did not have any details to share. Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Medicare Part B beneficiaries will continue to have coverage for lab tests when ordered by a provider, but the same will not apply for home tests.For those on Medicaid plans, all tests will continue to be covered for free until the end of September 2024.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will also continue to support uninsured individuals and socially vulnerable communities “pending resource availability,” according to a roadmap outlined by the US Department of Health and Human Services.There may be other avenues to free or cheap testing, too – perhaps through state and local governments or other programs.Recently, for example, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services announced the expansion of a program that now allows all state residents to order free tests through June.The Rockefeller Foundation, a private philanthropic organization, has also extended a public-private partnership program that works with states to get free tests to at-risk communities.“The testing phenomenon during Covid changed many times,” Aspinall said.It was a core focus at the beginning, but the priority then shifted to vaccines, she said. The initial Omicron wave brought a renewed interest in testing, and long waits for lab-based tests drove people to home tests.“It put power and privacy in an individual consumer’s hand,” Aspinall said.Millions of households took advantage of free Covid-19 tests provided by the federal government in the months after it launched, and a recent CDC report shows that the program helped to get kits to many who otherwise wouldn’t have tested and improved equity in testing overall.About 60% of US households ordered a test kit from COVIDTests.gov, and nearly a third of all US households reported using at least one of those tests by April or May last year.Nearly a quarter of people who reported using the government-provided tests said that they probably would not have tested for Covid-19 if not for the free kits, according to the report – suggesting that more than 13 million people took a Covid-19 test who otherwise wouldn’t have. More than 1 in 5 people who used their free tests reported at least one positive result.Overall, use of the free test kits was similar across racial and ethnic groups. This is a “considerable difference” from other home test kits, where use was “highly inequitable,” according to the report. Black people were more likely than White people to use tests provided through COVIDTests.gov but 72% less likely than White people to use other at-home test kits.Now, however, Covid-19 cases are a third of what they were a year ago, and hospitalizations and deaths are about as low as they’ve ever been. Testing rates have dropped significantly, too.Along with the decreased transmission, the volume of testing may have dropped as people better understand what the course of an infection looks like, Aspinall said.She estimates that people may use an average of one or two tests per incident, down from an average of five or six.While Covid-19 “remains a public health priority,” the federal government says “we are in a better place in our response than we were three years ago, and we can transition away from the emergency phase.”Still, experts agree that continued monitoring is key. Advancements in technologies like wastewater surveillance have helped supplement dwindling testing data, but testing will continue to be an important tool for individuals to keep themselves and their loved ones safe and healthy.“The public health emergency may be over but Covid is not over,” Aspinall said.",health,0.0
193,198,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/health/stroke-cognition-dementia-wellness/index.html,Up to 60% of stroke survivors may develop cognitive decline within a year,2023-05-01 05:01:00,"Up to 60% of all stroke survivors develop memory and thinking problems within a year, and one-third go on to develop dementia within five years, according to a new American Stroke Association scientific statement.“The numbers are staggering, right?” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.“This is a call to action to up our game and focus on prevention,” said Freeman, who was not part of the scientific committee who prepared the statement.An estimated 9.4 million American adults — about 3.6% of the US adult population — report having had a stroke, according to 2023 statistics from the American Heart Association.“Cognitive impairment is an often under-reported and under-diagnosed but yet very common condition stroke survivors frequently deal with,” said Dr. Nada El Husseini, an associate professor of neurology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, in a statement.About 40% of the survivors of stroke have mild cognitive impairment that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia. Mild or not, the mental difficulties can seriously affect quality of life, said El Husseini, who chaired the writing committee for the statement.“Cognitive impairment after stroke ranges from mild impairment to dementia and may affect many aspects of life, such as remembering, thinking, planning, language and attention, as well as a person’s ability to work, drive or live independently,” El Husseini said.Cognitive impairment is most common within the first two weeks after a stroke, the statement said. Mental decline may go hand in hand with other conditions associated with a stroke such as behavioral and personality changes, depression, physical disability and disruption in sleep, all of which can contribute to a lower quality of life.The American Stroke Association’s statement did offer some good news: About 20% of people who experience mild cognitive impairment after a stroke fully recover their cognitive function, typically within the first six months.People are at higher risk for strokes if they have atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that sufferers often describe as a quiver, flutter or flip-flop of the heart in the chest. Those with uncontrolled high cholesterol or high blood pressure are also at high risk, as are people who smoke or use drugs or alcohol. Being diabetic or obese can be risk factors, too.Ischemic strokes, caused by a clot in the blood vessels that feed blood to the brain, account for 87% of all strokes, according to the statement. Brain bleeds caused by a rupture of a weak vessel in the brain, called hemorrhagic strokes, are much less common, accounting for some 13% of all strokes.The following are signs of a stroke, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke:Other, less commons symptoms include dizziness, disorientation, nausea, memory loss or vomiting.Any of the warning signs may last only a few moments and then disappear, which could mean the person is having a minor stroke or a transient ischemic attack, or TIA. Any symptom should not be ignored, experts say, as it can signal a more serious stroke to come.“One might call a TIA a ‘lucky stroke’ because it’s less serious, but it really is a sentinel event,” Freeman said.It’s never too late for prevention, but serious effort is needed after even mild stroke to “extinguish the fire if you will, with aggressive change and aggressive medication therapy when appropriate,” Freeman added.“It should push people to make very drastic lifestyle changes: Eat better, exercise more, go on the appropriate statins or aspirins or whatever their doctor suggests are appropriate so that their risk is as low as possible,” he said.Damage to the brain occurs when some cells stop getting oxygen and die, while other brain cells may die due to bleeding in the brain. As a result, permanent brain damage can occur within minutes to hours, according to the institute. “Some brain cells die quickly but many linger in a compromised or weakened state for several hours,” it said.Immediate medical attention is key to lessening the impact of a stroke. Learning the symptoms of a stroke using the acronym FAST can help identify the signs quickly, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Be sure to capture the time when any symptom first appears, the CDC advises, to help medical personnel determine the best course of treatment.Additional strokes only worsen potential cognitive decline, the scientific statement said, so prevention is key. Stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, should be treated, as should atrial fibrillation.Keeping high blood pressure under control has been linked to a reduction in risk for additional strokes as well as mild cognitive impairment, the statement said.“Stroke survivors should be systematically evaluated for cognitive impairment so that treatment may begin as soon as possible after signs appear,” El Husseini said.“Perhaps the most pressing need, however, is the development of effective and culturally relevant treatments for post-stroke cognitive impairment,” she said. “We hope to see big enough clinical trials that assess various techniques, medications and lifestyle changes in diverse groups of patients that may help improve cognitive function.”",health,0.0
194,199,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/entertainment/peak-tv-2010s-decade/index.html,‘Peak TV’ shows that defined the 2010s,2023-05-07 23:25:00,"The next installment of CNN’s Emmy-winning original series “Decades” returned on Sunday with the “The 2010s,” and its two-hour premiere covered the groundbreaking television of the “Peak TV” decade.In a challenging task given the truly robust number of outstanding series, the CNN Entertainment team compiled a list of decade-defining scripted shows that best captured the zeitgeist.Read on for a look back at some of the most impactful television of the 2010s in order of when each series debuted:One of the decade’s most influential and successful shows came not from a broadcaster or premium channel, but a basic-cable network – AMC – launching the zombie drama that inspired plenty of imitators as well as numerous spinoffs. Indeed, after plodding into the next decade with multiple cast changes along the way, the show will live on, perhaps appropriately, in several new programs.HBO’s big swing at fantasy soared through the entire decade in a manner akin to Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and her dragon doing, well… you know what they did. “Thrones” became one of HBO’s biggest shows of all time, inspiring a resurgence of content in the fantasy genre and breeding a number of “Thrones” spinoff series. Based on George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series, the weekly release of episodes prompted a return to appointment viewing, and the sprawling budget provided viewers with visually stunning hour-long episodes that felt truly cinematic. “Thrones” still had issues – like the series finale and that Starbucks cup cameo – and the violence and nudity at times felt gratuitous, but the ensemble cast led by Clarke, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams swept viewers through an unforgettable eight seasons. (HBO and CNN are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)When “Scandal” debuted on ABC, it became the first network drama to present a Black female lead since the ’70s, with Kerry Washington as DC fixer Olivia Pope. Creator Shonda Rhimes told CNN, “I really wanted to make shows that I wanted to watch. I wanted to see shows that represented me, that represented the women I knew, that showed women in various stages of being competitive or angry or dark or joyful. You wanted to see everything.” Because the series appeared on network television’s linear format, the cast was able to interact with their audience of “Gladiators” on social media while new episodes aired in real time in a way that enhanced both the viewing experience and expanded the overall buzz of the show. Let’s also not forget about the seven glorious years where we got to watch Tony Goldwyn assert himself as dreamy president Fitzgerald Grant.While it only aired for three seasons, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele’s “Key & Peele” had a lasting effect with the sketch comedy’s social commentary and satirization. “Key & Peele” tackled race, stereotypes and the polarizing political climate of the era with thoughtfulness and humor. President Barack Obama even got in on their jokes by welcoming Key on the dais at the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner to appear as his popular recurring character Luther, Obama’s “anger translator.” Like “Broad City” and “Portlandia,” “Key & Peele” originated on the internet before expanding to a linear audience. Both men have since gone on more television and film success, with Peele winning a 2018 best original screenplay Oscar for “Get Out.”Comparisons to “Sex and the City” aside, Lena Dunham’s unapologetic ode to being a 20-something New Yorker in the 2010s did more for body positivity and frank conversations about sexuality and “adulting” in the first two seasons than most shows hope to accomplish in their entire runs. “Girls” also veritably launched the careers of two stars we’re more than happy to have around, namely Adam Driver and Allison Williams, who took her oft-disliked Marnie and ran with it in Jordan Peele’s brilliant “Get Out” (see above). Quirky and cringey as the “Girls” sometimes were, the show never strayed from a gritty commitment to the often penny-pinching realities of urban millennial living, and also gave us the wonder that was Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet), the best “cruel drunk” out there.Jenji Kohan’s “Orange Is the New Black” shattered tired stereotypes by lifting up stories about women of every age, size, race, sexual orientation and state of mental wellness, with critical commentary of the US justice system. It produced many breakout stars, including Laverne Cox, Dascha Polanco and Danielle Brooks, who became the faces of a TV renaissance wherein more substantive stories about women of color were told. Based on Piper Kerman’s memoir of the same name, “Orange” is also one of Netflix’s earliest forays into original content, and among the first to release full seasons at once, making “binge-watch” the new black.As the full withdrawal effect from “Breaking Bad” kicked in after its explosive 2013 series finale, series creator Vince Gilligan satiated viewers’ appetites with “Better Call Saul.” The legal drama was laden with cartel action and a slew of familiar characters as it followed the misadventures flawed lawyer Jimmy McGill, a.k.a. Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), and his romantic partner Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn). The series bounced between the past, present and future of the “Breaking Bad” timeline as viewers learned how “Slippin’ Jimmy” evolved into Goodman, a beloved character who first appeared in “Breaking Bad.” With “Breaking Bad,” “Better Call Saul” and the continuation of Jesse Pinkman’s (Aaron Paul) story in the 2019 “El Camino” movie all appearing within the decade, the 2010s were dominated by Gilligan’s universe.As aspiring actor Dev Shah, Aziz Ansari used his background (and his actual parents playing his parents on the series) to personalize the immigrant experience and make the point that even within varied cultures, many family dynamics and life experiences are shared. “Isn’t it weird, all of us first generation kids, we have these amazing lives all because our parents made these crazy sacrifices. Shouldn’t we find out more? Shouldn’t we at least try to thank them somehow?” Ansari as Dev asks in one episode. With “Master of None,” he does exactly that.When it comes to “Peak TV,” few titles come close to Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” which arguably hasn’t even peaked yet (that fifth and final season is still coming). With homage and nostalgia that hearkens back to ’80s-era classics like “Stand By Me” and “Ghostbusters,” “Stranger Things” simultaneously feels new and fresh. That same mix is mirrored in the impeccable casting, which features Winona Ryder in one of her best roles since coming onto the scene in 1988’s “Beetlejuice,” and Millie Bobby Brown as the still-mysterious, Jean Grey-like Eleven. Each season has brought stellar actors into the Hawkins fold, from Season 2’s Max (the excellent Sadie Sink) to the best kid sister ever Erica (Priah Ferguson) to last season’s raucous Eddie (Joseph Quinn). Plus, let’s not forget that incredible title sequence with its synth-heavy instrumentation.Issa Rae was one of the stars who successfully transitioned from YouTube to the small screen and we are all the better for it. Her hit HBO comedy “Insecure” is as authentically awkward as only someone struggling with adulthood can be. While Rae’s character spent many seasons searching for romantic love, in the end we discover it is the love of her friends which really sustains her. With Rae’s unapologetic wit, “Insecure” is a celebration of Black female friendship. She kept it real, and audiences responded with devotion and gratitude.Featuring stupendous performances from Sandra Oh and Emmy-winner Jodie Comer, this engrossing series from Phoebe Waller-Bridge – the genius behind “Fleabag” (see below) – had viewers second and triple-guessing at every turn. “Killing Eve” took the well-trodden spy thriller trope and turned it on its head with a fresh and fiendish female perspective. The show was also undeniably funny, giving Comer and Oh an ever-expanding playground in which to spar.This groundbreaking FX series from Ryan Murphy explored New York’s ballroom scene at the height of the AIDS crisis in the ’80s. Beyond the glamour and vogueing and “tens across the board,” “Pose” is a show about love, compassion, acceptance, fearlessness and family. The series helped usher in a new era of representation for transgender actors in entertainment. “Pose” is lauded for its depiction of how the LGBTQ+ community remained resilient in the 1980s and 1990s, a theme that feels more topical than ever in the current political climate.“Modern Family” (ABC) 2009 - 2020: With heart and humor, this sitcom broke stereotypes with aplomb, and had you belly laughing – and sometimes tearing – at every episode.“Downton Abbey” (PBS) 2010 - 2015: PBS provided further evidence that TV success can come from all over with a very commercial hit in the form of this addictive upstairs/downstairs drama, chronicling the early 20th-century challenges of an aristocratic family and its army of servants.“Homeland” (Showtime) 2011 - 2020: With cinematic scale, international intrigue and high-stakes drama, episodes of this edge-of-your-seat terrorism thriller were like weekly installments of the “Bourne” franchise. Claire Danes’s portrayal of CIA agent Carrie Mathison, was, like “Homeland” itself, powerful and INTENSE.“Veep” (HBO) 2012 - 2019: Never has a sitcom more brutally (and, according to actual politicos, accurately) satirized US lobbying, campaigning and governing. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was hilarious as Vice President (and in Season 3) President Selina Meyer, but hail to the ultimate bagman Gary (played brilliantly by Tony Hale.)“The Americans” (FX) 2013 - 2018: The Cold War received a fresh look from FX’s series about spies hiding in plain sight before the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, which burnished its reputation by doing what a lot of series can’t in its finale – namely, sticking the landing.“Jane the Virgin” (The CW) 2014 - 2019: The CW dramedy captured just the right balance of romance, soapy drama and comedy with its telenovela-inspired story starring Gina Rodriguez as a young woman who gets accidentally artificially inseminated, and winds up caught between her boyfriend and the biological father.“Black-ish” (ABC) 2014 - 2022: This series about a well-to-do Black family was not afraid to tackle real-life issues around race and class all while making us laugh.“Mr. Robot” (USA) 2015 - 2019: Few shows encapsulated the paranoia and political apprehension of the decade better than USA’s twisty “Please tell me you’re seeing this too?” thriller, which made Rami Malek a star in the process.“Fresh Off the Boat” (ABC) 2015 - 2020: An Asian American family’s move from a Chinatown neighborhood to Orlando, Florida proved to be a hilarious fish out of water series.“The Crown” (Netflix) 2016 - 2023: As the real-life end drew near for Britain’s longest reining monarch, the late Queen Elizabeth II, viewers are taken back to the early days of the young queen’s ascension in “The Crown,” a dramatization of the personal and historical events that shaped her reign, providing plenty of internet fodder for royalists along the way.“Fleabag” (Amazon) 2016 - 2019: Phoebe Waller-Bridge perfected what so many had failed to do before her sharp Amazon Prime series – breaking the fourth wall for cutting and insightful commentary on the scene at hand. Plus, the show’s wrenching back-and-forth between sidesplitting laughs and well-earned tears made it an instant classic.",entertainment,0.0

Leading the nominations in the unscripted categories were shows such as “Jersey Shore Family Vacation,” “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and “Vanderpump Rules.” Jennifer Coolidge received the Comic Genius Award, while the best musical moment award went to Purple Hearts for “Come Back Home.”The annual ceremony was originally supposed to be hosted by Drew Barrymore, but Barrymore announced on Thursday that she’ll be stepping down from hosting in a show of support for the ongoing writers’ strike. While some of Barrymore’s bits had already been taped prior to the strike commencing, the ceremony went on without a formal host. In a statement, Barrymore vowed to return as host for the 2024 show.Following reports that striking members of the Writers Guild of America planned to picket at the Santa Monica Barker Hangar, where the event is being filmed, executive producer Bruce Gillmer shared in a statement to CNN that the MTV Movie & TV Awards were “pivoting away from a live event” by airing a pre-taped version of the ceremony on Sunday instead.Part of that pivot during the telecast included flashback clips from previous MTV Movie & TV Awards shows, which constituted an overwhelming majority of the show, along with pre-taped speeches from winners.A full list of nominees follows below, with the winners indicated in bold.BEST MOVIE“Avatar: The Way of Water”“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”“Elvis”“Nope”“Scream VI” *WINNER“Smile”“Top Gun: Maverick”BEST SHOW“Stranger Things”“The Last of Us” *WINNER“The White Lotus”“Wednesday”“Wolf Pack”“Yellowstone”“Yellowjackets”BEST PERFORMANCE IN A MOVIEAustin Butler — “Elvis”Florence Pugh — “Don’t Worry Darling:KeKe Palmer — “Nope”Michael B.

The strike has already affected numerous productions, including the MTV Movie & TV Awards itself.Drew Barrymore stepped down from her hosting duties to support the writers, and a pre-taped broadcast aired instead of what was supposed to be a live show after the WGA West announced plans to picket outside the Los Angeles event venue. Pre-recorded bits featuring Barrymore and pre-taped speeches by winners were aired, with clips of past MTV Movie & TV Award moments filling the space in between award handouts.Other productions impacted by the strike include all of the network late night shows, which went dark on Tuesday as the strike began, along with “Saturday Night Live,” which canceled this weekend’s show that would’ve seen alum Pete Davidson returning as host.Netflix’s “Stranger Things” also announced on Saturday that they’ve halted production on Season 5 due to the strike, further delaying the highly anticipated final season.",entertainment,0.0

The body is miraculous…. Even though I feel like the Tin Man, needing oil for all my new joints (hips, knees, ankles, tibia etc ).

199,204,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/entertainment/silo-review/index.html,‘Silo’ explores a dystopian world where residents can’t go outside (but viewers might want to),2023-05-05 08:50:00,"“Silo” is an unfortunately apt name for a series that feels as if it’s slowly spinning in circles, set in another dystopian future where the lingering remnants of humankind grapple with how they got there and what they do next. Apple TV+ has taken some big sci-fi bets (see “Foundation”), but despite its provocative themes this series inspires a little too much curiosity about when and how to find the exit.“We do not know who built the silo” and “We do not know when it will be safe to go outside” are part of the mantra repeated by those living in this confined space, who only know that the domicile was built more than 100 years earlier and that it’s likely certain death if they’re forced to “clean,” or venture outside into what appears to be a forbidding wasteland.Based on the book series by Hugh Howey, the series inspires comparisons to cinematic visions of a world where those in authority aren’t sharing everything with its populace, from “Soylent Green” (was that really a half-century ago?) to “Snowpiercer,” another series (after the movie) boxed in by the parameters of its premise.Adapted by producer Graham Yost (“Justified”), “Silo” boasts an impressive cast, and exhibits a willingness to introduce and then shed major characters.At its core is Juliette (Rebecca Ferguson), a technical genius who keeps the silo’s life-support systems functioning, who begins asking probing and uncomfortable questions after a personal loss involving a mysterious death.Her investigation doesn’t sit well with the bureaucratic figures running the place (Tim Robbins and Common key among them), who clearly know more than they’re sharing with the population in an effort to keep the silo’s residents docile and manageable. That includes rules about who gets to procreate in an effort to sustain and protect this society’s limited resources.While the 10-episode season begins with a fair amount of momentum, featuring Rashida Jones and David Oyelowo at the outset, forward progress pretty quickly slows to a crawl. That does foster suspense about what’s actually outside, but it doesn’t do a whole lot to propel the audience through this season, much less stoke excitement for another.Building this sort of elaborate world takes some time, and the inherent warnings about authoritarianism and blindly trusting the government give the series a certain real-world resonance. (As a footnote, the dystopian backdrop has a close cousin in “Black Knight,” a South Korean series premiering on Netflix in May, so there’s a lot of that going around.)The inherent mystery here, however, feels stretched to the point of strained, exacerbated by characters that don’t consistently pop. When Common’s smooth-talking security enforcer ominously says, “We all work for the good of the silo,” for viewers who actually do have the option of going outside, it’s reason to consider how well a plodding exercise like “Silo” really works for the good of us.“Silo” premieres May 5 on Apple TV+.

When I got the call to go in to host it, I could not get over it,” Weir told CNN in a recent interview. “I’m still not over it. It’s still mind boggling.”Peacock is streaming this year’s semi-finals and grand final beginning on May 9.Viewers can participate with Weir via “Watch With” by submitting questions to the host as they watch the competition together.The former professional ice skater is a super fan of the annual competition, which pits singers, who must perform live, from participating countries against each other and has become a worldwide phenomena.Weir’s hosting for NBC’s streaming company last year won him rave reviews. He said it has encouraged him to up his game this time around.“I have to keep my level strong and this year I’m so excited about so many of the songs. I think it’s gonna be a tremendous competition and a tremendous event,” he said. “I think that that energy that we’ll get from the stage in Liverpool will keep me right up where I want to be and that I can just keep bringing this thing that I love so much to my country.”Weir has plenty of experience having provided commentary for figure skating competitions for years.He deeply feels the importance of “performing for an American audience and bringing them the biggest, most watched event outside of the sporting world in the entire world.”“I have to do it in a different way and in a way that Americans can feel like they’re a part of it. And, now, this year more than ever, the United States actually has a vote with the rest of the world in choosing the champion of the Eurovision Song Contest,” he said. “I think that it’s my obligation to make sure that America can sit back and enjoy the contest as much as I do, pick their favorites, send in their votes.”“If there’s one thing I know about Americans watching television is that we love to vote for a singing contest,” Weir said, laughing. “I just hope that people run with it and go there with me and that new fans are born every time I talk about Eurovision or host the Eurovision Song Contest.”",entertainment,0.0

202,207,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/entertainment/summer-movie-preview-2023/index.html,These are the summer films looking to recapture that blockbuster movie magic you remember,2023-05-06 16:34:00,"Most moviegoers can pinpoint one summer movie – or perhaps, a summer of movies – in their formative years that really and truly cemented their love for going to the cinema, whether it be 1975’s “Jaws,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” from 1982, or “Independence Day” in 1996.Sure, a lot has happened since those golden years of the bustling multiplex – most notably the streaming revolution, not to mention a multi-year pandemic – but studio heads at last week’s CinemaCon (the annual convention where Hollywood shows theater owners what they have in store for the coming year) were quick to thump their chests and say, “Movies are back!”For proof, one need only look at this year’s billion-dollar-grossing “Super Mario Bros. Movie” (not to mention last year’s “Avatar” sequel) to see that theatrical movies, as it were, never really left. And while streaming has clearly siphoned off part of the audience, particularly for more serious films, what we think of as “summer movies” still have the potential to rake in cash just like the old days.With that said, at this juncture just ahead of the summer months, behold the list of flicks releasing “only in theaters” that are hoping to do exactly that, in order of release date:What better way to kick off summer than with the gang of Marvel-ous misfits known as the Guardians of the Galaxy? After many delays and back-and-forths with director James Gunn, the franchise-closing third installment of the trilogy is finally here, and it’s said to pack an emotional wallop, according to CNN’s critic Brian Lowry. In addition to the comic antics and the eye-popping visuals, a “Guardians” movie always delivers when it comes to a throwback soundtrack, so get ready.The gang is back for, yes, a tenth time, and while some are content to amuse themselves with how the “Fast and Furious” filmmakers come up with all the artful titles for all these endless sequels, others are here for the cars. This installment, welcoming back franchise regulars Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris, will welcome Jason Momoa and Academy Award-winners Rita Moreno and Brie Larson into the furious fold. Jason Statham, John Cena and more Oscar-winners Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron also return from previous fast and furious forays.The buzz for this latest Disney live-action “reimagining” has been bubbling for quite awhile as more is unveiled, but those faithful to the Oscar-winning 1989 animated classic have yet to deliver their final verdict. One thing’s for sure though – droves will likely go and see it, kids in tow, to decide if they want to make this new film part of their world.A sequel to one of the most inventive animated films of the new millennium, this follow-up to 2018’s Oscar-winning “Into the Spider-Verse” has the potential to raise the bar even higher as the story of Miles Morales – a counterpart to Peter Parker and Spider-Man all his own – is expanded even further, with Spider-Gwen’s help.After an impressive, franchise-launching first film in 2007 starring Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, many of the sequels in this film series based on the iconic toys have been rather dense and hard to follow, save for the spirited spinoff “Bumblebee” from 2018 starring Hailee Steinfeld. One only hopes this one, featuring animal-like Transformers known as Maximals, doesn’t run too long, and makes even the tiniest bit of sense.This one just might be the one to beat this summer, with DC bringing its universe of superheroes to an emotional and action-packed crescendo, deftly led by embattled star Ezra Miller’s super-fast Flash. The movie, previewed for attendees at last month’s CinemaCon, has more that a few incredible reveals up its sleeve that are sure to make waves, with high hopes that “The Flash” is a mainstay blockbuster throughout much of the season. (CNN and DC are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)While a cool summer movie would be an AI-generated “Star Wars” film as directed by Wes Anderson, nothing comes close the actual work of the real auteur, who takes on a bit of the sci-fi genre in his latest film “Asteroid City.” Boasting a per-usual incredible and starry cast along with trademark Anderson-esque visual splendor, the film follows stargazers who are visited by aliens in a place in the desert called, you guessed it, Asteroid City. Expect very low-key high jinks to ensue.Directed by the accomplished Tim Story, this trope-busting slasher comedy-horror hybrid looks like it will be a crowd-pleaser and then some, featuring an all-Black cast and hinging on the premise that since they’re all Black, as the tag line says, “We can’t all die first.” Among many other talents, look for “Insecure’s” Yvonne Orji and “Saturday Night Live” alum Jay Pharoah.Fire and water do indeed mix in this original story from Pixar, featuring a world in which the elements must learn to live together in the same crowded urban environment. Featuring the voices of many up-and-coming stars, the hope here is that the allegory for race relations veers more toward subtlety than heavy-handedness.For those truly looking to recreate the nostalgia of summer movies past, look no further than this fifth adventure from Indy (Harrison Ford), although for the first time, Steven Spielberg (still an executive producer) passes the director reins to James Mangold (of “Logan” and “Ford v. Ferrari”). The film brings back John Rhys-Davies of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” fame, and also welcomes “Fleabag” star Phoebe Waller-Bridge and “Logan’s” Boyd Holbrook along for the ride. The bar has been set rather low after the misfire that was “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in 2008, so Indiana and co. have nowhere to go but up.This uproarious looking movie takes the girls’ trip idea made famous and successful by movies like “Bridesmaids” and “Girls Trip,” this time telling the story from an Asian American perspective, letting a quartet of gifted actresses – including “Emily in Paris” standout Ashley Park and brilliant Oscar nominee Stephanie Hsu from “Everything Everywhere All at Once” – have what looks to be the best and wildest time ever.‘Savior of the movies’ Tom Cruise is back again as Ethan Hunt, faced with yet another impossible task that, somehow, we know he’ll pull off. Let’s just hope the movie isn’t as dense, or as long, as the title.Another one that looks like a surefire hit, everything that comes out about “Barbie” ahead of the film’s release just makes everyone even more excited, including Ryan Gosling’s hilarious observations on harnessing his “Ken-ergy” at CinemaCon. The movie’s tongue-in-plastic-cheek feel surely has much to do with its director and co-writer Greta Gerwig, creator of “Lady Bird,” who was clearly an unorthodox but refreshing choice to helm this Mattel-themed excursion.For those who rolled their eyes at the previous entry on “Barbie,” head on over to the theater next door for this very serious film from the very serious Christopher Nolan, who promised attendees at this year’s CinemaCon that the movie – about the inventor of the atomic bomb – captures the life and times of “the most important person who ever lived.” Like I said, serious. Cillian Murphy stars.Not content just to keep updating their animated movies with live-action versions, Disney is also continuing its let’s-turn-our-theme-park-rides-into-movies tradition, after the uber-successful “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise and somewhat less-explosive “Jungle Cruise” from 2021. This adaptation follows a 2003 version with Eddie Murphy.For those looking to get their creature feature needs met this summer, look no further than “The Meg 2,” which will hopefully improve upon the strangely lackluster first film from 2018 about an insanely large prehistoric shark (read: megalodon) who is back for a second course (along with bristling hero Jason Statham).Surely looking to build on the hype (and big bucks) of the “Mario” movie, this flick based on the auto racing game had a little more work cut out for it, as star David Harbour pointed out at CinemaCon when he observed that the game is essentially a racing simulator and that there was no real storyline to work with. Enter Jann Mardenborough, a real-life Gran Turismo player portrayed in the new film by “Beau is Afraid” star Archie Madekwe, whose video game-playing skills landed him a shot to become an actual professional race car driver.Initially meant for streaming platforms, this vehicle will herald the cinematic arrival of DC Studios’ first Latino superhero, played by Xolo Maridueña of “Cobra Kai” and “Parenthood” fame. If the fast-paced trailer is any indication, the movie looks sure to whisk those dog days of summer doldrums away quite nicely.",entertainment,0.0
203,208,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/entertainment/queen-charlotte-review/index.html,‘Queen Charlotte’ spins ‘Bridgerton’ into franchise territory with a regal origin story,2023-05-03 09:49:00,"Setting aside whether the world really needs the equivalent of a “Bridgerton Cinematic Universe,” Netflix has taken that predictable plunge with “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story,” a cleverly constructed prequel to producer Shonda Rhimes’ media darling. Reaching back to the origins of supporting players, the limited series offers additional insight to how this sumptuous society came to be, while showcasing its more mature denizens.Oscillating between two time frames, the six-episode series features its namesake (Golda Rosheuvel) as the matchmaking monarch grousing about her adult children’s failure to produce heirs, flashing back to her assumption of that title as a lass (nicely played by India Amarteifio) when she enters into an arranged marriage to King George (Corey Mylchreest).Charlotte’s initial relief that her husband is rather easy on the eyes (this is “Bridgerton,” after all) is soon tempered by his erratic and distant behavior, prompting questions as to what secrets he might be hiding.Young, far from home and faced with this mercurial situation, Charlotte must also grapple with his imperious mother (“Game of Thrones’” Michelle Fairley), who proves reluctant to relinquish any power to the new queen. While she does have a helpful attendant in the young Brimsley (Sam Clemmett), Charlotte fights a battle to assert her own authority and personality, lending credence to the older Queen’s weary lament, “The life of a royal is lonely.”The young Charlotte does find a willing and much-needed confidant in Rebecca, a.k.a. Lady Danbury (Arsema Thomas in the past, and again Adjoa Andoh in the present), whose machinations as the savvy, much-younger wife of an ancient husband (Cyril Nri) create a parallel thread that fleshes out her back story. Ruth Gemmell also appears as matriarch Violet Bridgerton, providing another connection to both the original series and how what transpired decades ago informs its present.As for that past, “Queen Charlotte” delves into how the world of Bridgerton came to be, as these young royals must navigate what is definitely not a color-blind society. The series also offers an intriguing window into mental-health issues as filtered through the prism of an age where the language didn’t even exist to intelligently discuss such matters, much less understand them.“Bridgerton” flourished as a modernized spin on old costume dramas, a steamier version of “Downton Abbey” and its ilk that embellished all the soapy, class-conscious shenanigans with sex and tasteful nudity. “Queen Charlotte” understandably doesn’t bother trying to reinvent that wheel, but rather seems content to deftly embroider another layer beneath it.Frankly, the level of hoopla surrounding “Bridgerton” (which included a first-season Emmy nomination as best drama) felt a trifle unwarranted, and the second season suffered from the losses of Regé-Jean Page and its Lady Whistledown mystery; still, given the show’s popularity Rhimes has shrewdly tapped its elder contingent, along with fresh new faces, to build on that foundation, aided by Fairley giving them all a run for their money in terms of stiff-upper-lipped devotion to custom and duty.Summing up the show’s unabashed sense of romance falls to the young king’s trusty servant Reynolds (Freddie Dennis), who at one point muses, “Great love can make miracles.”When it comes to achieving TV success, a just-OK show that lands at just the right time occasionally can too.“Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story” premieres May 4 on Netflix.",entertainment,0.0

Studios presentation at CinemaCon last week that “Dune: Part Two” is much more “action-packed” and an “epic war movie,” following the first film’s “contemplative” nature. By the looks of the trailer, his words ring true. (Warner Bros. Studios and CNN are all part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)Chalamet and Zendaya are seen together in the trailer picking back up where they left off in the deep desert lands of Arrakis, as they navigate their characters’ love for each other while preparing for impending war.“We really see Paul Atreides become a leader here,” Chalamet said at CinemaCon, after explaining that the first film saw his character more through the lens of a “student.”We get a glimpse in the trailer of Atreides’ blue eyes, a transformation caused by his use of Spice, the planet’s most precious commodity that gives its user mystical powers. We’re even treated to clips of Atreides mounting a giant sandworm, and sharing a special kiss with Chani.The trailer also showcases a slew of new characters.There is the frightening (and bald) Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, a ruthless warlord competing with Glossu Rabban Harkonnen (Dave Bautista) to take on the role of ruler of Arrakis – much like a futuristic version of “Succession.”Florence Pugh is also seen as Princess Irulan, who served as a narrator of sorts in the novel and is the daughter of Christopher Walken’s Emperor Shaddam IV, overlord of the entire galaxy.Javier Bardem, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling, and Josh Brolin reprise their characters from 2021’s “Dune,” appearing in the new film alongside newcomers Lea Seydoux, Tim Blake Nelson and Souheila Yacoub.“Dune: Part Two” will premiere in theaters on November 3.",entertainment,0.0

She underwent surgery, removing part of her pancreas and all of her spleen, and is now cancer free, Menounos told “Today.”She stressed the importance of early detection.Menounos explained she was originally diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, but was experiencing abdominal pain.

214,219,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/26/entertainment/john-mulaney-baby-j-special-netflix/index.html,That time John Mulaney had me in stitches (literally),"09:38 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Comedian John Mulaney reflects on what led him to rehab in his new stand-up special for Netflix, “Baby J.” His stories about healing reminded me of a time Mulaney’s comedy helped me feel better.The comic was for years heavily addicted to cocaine and prescription medication before seeking treatment in 2020. He even hints in his new set that his old style of comedy, with theatrical leaps and bounds across the stage, may have been due to being high at the time.“If you’ve seen me do stand-up before, I have kind of a different vibe now,” Mulaney says near the top of “Baby J.”He then launches into an hour-long tale of his recovery that began with a “star-studded” intervention, in a room filled with a dozen of his friends (six over Zoom, he laughs), including Seth Meyers, Fred Armison, Bill Hader and Natasha Lyonne.“I was the best looking person at my intervention,” he tells the crowd, because he was “cocaine skinny” with a fresh haircut, one that caused him to be two hours late to his intervention.Mulaney completed a two-month stay and rehab and says in the set that he’s now doing great. He is a relationship with actress Olivia Munn, and, together, they share a son, Malcolm.Mulaney’s “Baby J” jokes are multilayered; when he tells a story about doing cocaine off of a Koala baby changing station in a gas station bathroom, he later does a callback when he finds himself at a museum needing to change his son’s diaper.“Hello, old friend,” he says with a salute to the Koala.Mulaney was testing out his new material when I saw him perform in New York in June 2021. It was my first night out since the pandemic started more than a year earlier.  Working from home with my husband and young daughter, I desperately needed the laughs. Mulaney delivered a raw and vulnerable set at City Winery titled, “From Scratch.”The stories he told were so shocking, I thought about them for days afterward. One bit about hawking a Rolex for drug money made it into “Baby J.”I saw his show again that August, where Mulaney sang a tune about how his reputation had “changed” and he was no longer so likable, like “Bo Burnham.” He was more polished and sold out a small theater – a feat, Mulaney says, because there was a time he wasn’t sure he’d survive, let alone do standup again.This broke my heart, because Mulaney’s comedy had once rescued me from my own darkness.In April 2018, I was sitting in a hospital bed, having just given birth to my daughter. I was recovering from a difficult cesarean, my baby was in the NICU, and I felt confused and scared. As a distraction, I turned on Mulaney’s Netflix special, “Kid Gorgeous.” I laughed so hard, I popped two staples in my lower abdomen.When my doctor later came to fix my wound, she asked what had possibly caused the issue.“John Mulaney,” I responded. She nodded.I later met Mulaney at an event the next year and recalled to him how I needed stitches after he made me laugh so hard.“Oh wow,” he replied. “That is simultaneously the most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard and the greatest compliment I’ve ever received.”“John Mulaney: Baby J” is streaming now on Netflix.",style,0.0

216,221,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/entertainment/guardians-of-the-galaxy-fantastic-four-column/index.html,What ‘Fantastic Four’ can learn from ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’,2023-05-05 08:57:00,"As “Guardians of the Galaxy” caps off an improbably successful trilogy, the ragtag heroes carry several lessons for the granddaddy of Marvel super-teams, Fantastic Four, as the studio embarks on a third stab at getting that foundational title right.Twentieth Century Fox, which wound up with movie rights to the quartet, adapted Stan Lee and Jack Kirby’s flagship comic in 2005, then rebooted it a decade later.Neither entirely worked (although the first did well enough to merit a sequel), which was why attention almost immediately turned to Fantastic Four, as well as X-Men, when Marvel regained those rights through parent Disney’s acquisition of Fox’s entertainment assets in 2019.Marvel’s long-awaited take on a “Fantastic Four” movie is now scheduled for 2025, and has kept the internet abuzz of late with casting rumors. Yet no amount of star power (or talented unknowns, for that matter) will lead to victory for a film that fails to master the delicate art of introducing a team of superheroes, which remains perhaps the most daunting challenge in the comic-book-movie realm, 15 years into the hit-laden run that Marvel launched with “Iron Man.”The original “Guardians,” somehow, bucked that trend, building toward this third installment, which feels like a true climactic chapter, made more so by director James Gunn heading off to steer the ship at Marvel rival DC (which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery).To understand how “Guardians” triumphed, and what “Fantastic Four” can glean from that, it’s helpful looking back to what defined and distinguished the original comics, and indeed Lee and Kirby’s staggeringly productive collaboration during the early 1960s.For starters, the cosmically irradiated heroes featured one member, the Thing, who hated what he had become, having been transformed into a monster. He frequently feuded and fought with his teammates – Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman (nee Girl) and the Human Torch – who also grappled with issues of being public figures, no secret identities required.Those early Marvel comics felt real and relevant, in a way that the genre hadn’t until then, and that spoke to a generation whose lives would be rattled by the turbulence of the ’60s.Strictly as entertainment, the 2005 “Fantastic Four” had its moments – including the Thing-Human Torch relationship as played by Michael Chiklis and a pre-Captain America Chris Evans – but didn’t possess much of a “wow” factor. The same went for a disappointing sequel featuring the Silver Surfer, mostly squandering one of Kirby’s more visually striking and out-there creations.The considerably darker reboot upgraded the Thing effects and, with the benefit of hindsight, chose well in picking Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan for key roles. Overall, though, the film fell flat, getting mired in wonky science about interdimensional portals.“Guardians,” by contrast, prospered in a way “Fantastic Four” didn’t, capturing a mix of action, familial warmth and no small amount of silliness. While becoming too campy is always a danger in this genre, humor was an integral part of the comics and remains as ingrained in the title’s DNA as those cosmic rays.“Vol. 3” of the “Guardians” saga leans heavily into that sense of family, including a squabbling-sibling dynamic among the characters. The series accomplished that, notably, with heroes that were particularly obscure and outlandish, including a talking raccoon and a monosyllabic tree.Although much of this discussion inevitably tilts toward the most-engaged fans, there’s a reason Fantastic Four ushered in Marvel Comics’ storied run in the ’60s and remains a source of fascination now. Marvel Studios also needs something to excite audiences, after seeing its aura of box-office invincibility experience a few setbacks, if not entirely punctured, in the wake of “Avengers: Endgame.”Fantastic Four and Guardians of the Galaxy are distinct concepts, and Marvel must treat them as such. Yet in terms of the big-screen popularity that has eluded the former and the latter has achieved, “Fantastic Four” will need to at least broadly emulate those qualities if it hopes to make the third time the charm.“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” premieres May 5 in US theaters.",entertainment,0.0

At its best, it’s a lightweight companion to “All the President’s Men,” presenting the flip side of all that planning and frantic covering up by what amounted to Keystone Criminals. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)“Watergate: High Crimes in the White House” (CBS)Although Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein are among those interviewed, there’s a bit more of a skew in this documentary toward CBS’ role as one of the few TV news outlets to cover the scandal, including Lesley Stahl’s recollections about the story, footage of Walter Cronkite weighing in on the scandal and stately reporter Daniel Schorr discovering on air that he had earned a spot on Nixon’s enemies list as he read through the names.Incorporating interviews old and new, the project also captures just what a huge “hit” the televised Watergate hearings were, back in the days when there were three networks and not a whole lot of viewing alternatives.“Watergate: Blueprint for a Scandal”A four-part docuseries that played on CNN, the project features interviews with John Dean, among others.“Watergate” (History)The History Channel’s exhaustive six-part docuseries, which originally premiered in 2018.“Gaslit” (Starz)This eight-part dramatization of Watergate is worth catching for those who haven’t seen it, with Julia Roberts as whistleblower Martha Mitchell, an unrecognizable Sean Penn as her husband, Nixon Attorney General John Mitchell, and Dan Stevens as John Dean. Exaggerated in part to the point of satire, it’s nevertheless a telling look at the scandal and its key players, including a wildly over-the-top Shea Whigham as G. Gordon Liddy.“All the President’s Men” (HBO Max)A rewatch of director Alan J. Pakula’s 1976 film version of Woodward and Bernstein’s book stands out for unintended reasons in certain places, such as a Washington Post editors meeting that consists entirely of older White guys in white shirts, debating whether to stand by the young reporters.At its core, though, the film holds up and then some, from its exploration of classic shoe-leather reporting to the scared sources unable to stay silent about the corruption they witnessed. Add to that the sensational performances and William Goldman’s Oscar-winning screenplay, with signature lines like Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook) telling Woodward (Robert Redford) to “Follow the money” and “The truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.”“The Post”Steven Spielberg’s 2017 movie offers a deeper dive into another angle of the story, specifically the relationship between Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) and publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep), and the courage the latter exhibited – having been thrust into that role – in withstanding pressure from the White House when publishing the Pentagon Papers in 1971.

219,224,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/01/entertainment/a-small-light-review/index.html,‘A Small Light’ puts a heartbreaking spotlight on Anne Frank’s protectors,2023-05-05 15:55:00,"The greatest heroism often resides in the actions of ordinary people in extraordinary situations and times, and so it is with “A Small Light,” which tells the story of Anne Frank through the eyes of Miep Gies, the woman who helped hide her and her family. Slow starting at eight parts, the National Geographic/Disney+ miniseries builds steadily, in a fashion that’s ultimately both stirring and heartbreaking.The story opens with Gies (Bel Powley) desperately needing a job to avoid having her adopted family try to marry her off to her (secretly gay) brother. She gets hired by Otto Frank (Liev Schreiber, terrific if barely recognizable), a successful businessman preparing to bring his family to Amsterdam to join him.Flash forward to 1940, and the Germans are marching in, eventually leaving Frank, as he puts it, with “nowhere to go,” except the annex space above the office, where his family and four others would spend more than two years.“What I’m asking you to do is dangerous,” he warns Gies, but she finds the reservoirs of strength to assist them, along with her husband Jan (Joe Cole) and a handful of others, who are dogged by the reality of not knowing who they can trust.The format allows the producers (a team led by Tony Phelan and Joan Rater) to take the time to get to know the various players, including Miep and Jan’s sweet, awkward courtship. That pays dividends later as the two are tested, separately and together, as they seek to help those displaced and endangered by Nazi atrocities.“A Small Light” exhibits considerable restraint in creating that sense of tension mostly without explicit violence, but with the persistent threat of it if their charges are discovered. The series also conveys the thirst for shreds of normalcy and moments of lightness amid their confinement and constant fear of exposure, tempered by the pain of those separated from loved ones, especially children.Among the more quietly devastating scenes, Miep gifts the wide-eyed young Anne (Billie Boullet) a pair of shoes, proceeding to tell her all the weird and wonderful things that she will do in them as she grows older – a journey, the audience knows, which will never come. The same goes for the Franks celebrating the bombings that rattle their makeshift home, praying for the allies’ arrival.Gies – who found and preserved Anne’s diary, which Otto later published – lived to be 100, and the title is derived from her oft-stated quote about the ability of even an ordinary person to “turn on a small light in a dark room.”“A Small Light” takes its time in illuminating that source of inspiration, but by the time its eight chapters have concluded, its big heart should ensure that there isn’t (or at least shouldn’t be) a dry eye in the house.“A Small Light” premieres May 1 at 9 p.m. ET on National Geographic, with episodes streaming the next day on Disney+.",entertainment,0.0
220,225,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/entertainment/bupkis-review/index.html,"In ‘Bupkis,’ Pete Davidson is the worst part of a series about being Pete Davidson",2023-05-04 08:27:00,"Give Pete Davidson a bit of credit for making himself the least interesting part of a series about being Pete Davidson. Much of that has to do with the all-star cast with which the former “SNL” star has swaddled himself in “Bupkis,” a frequently funny and later somewhat tiresome Peacock comedy, which only serves to reinforce the sense the comic’s tabloid-friendly offscreen life generally remains more interesting than any of his onscreen exploits.Having already played a version of himself in the Peacock movie “The King of Staten Island,” Davidson certainly doesn’t seem overly concerned about stretching his acting chops. The main appeal here, given the unabashed self-absorption of the exercise, hinges on the casting, with Edie Falco (“The Sopranos”) and Joe Pesci as his mom and grandpa, plus an assortment of high-profile cameos, from Ray Romano to Jon Stewart to John Mulaney, which conjure the lion’s share of the laughs.Davidson is introduced Google-ing himself, chafing at living in the public eye while residing (uncomfortably at times, as an early sequence demonstrates) with his mom. The idea of Davidson existing in an extended state of adolescence runs throughout the show, prompting his grandpa to gently chide him by saying, “You run around like a kid and you’re not a kid anymore. You’re a man.”The title “Bupkis” is intended to indicate that viewers aren’t necessarily supposed to take the series at face value, but the sporadic use of biographical photos underscores that the show (produced and written by Davidson, Judah Miller and Dave Sirus under the stewardship of “SNL” patriarch Lorne Michaels) offers snapshots of Davidson’s life, including the loss of his father on September 11 and a wedding the young Pete had to attend in its aftermath.The series proves considerably stronger when it leans toward the inconsequential and gleefully crude, relying on the heavy hitters in the cast, or those who just drop by (among them Bobby Cannavale and Steve Buscemi), to carry the load. There’s also some good stuff spoofing Hollywood, as one episode hinges on Davidson getting cast in a J.J. Abrams movie, before the role turns out to be considerably less than he envisioned.Laughing at himself is great to a point, which includes addressing the fact that people seem more interested in who he dates than what he does. By contrast, “Bupkis” sags when it zeroes in on Davidson and his substance-abuse issues toward the end, which can’t help but feel as if the show is drifting, perhaps unavoidably, into the almost cliched “A Star is Born” quadrant of celebrity biography.For Davidson, lampooning his image has practically become a full-time job, to the exclusion of demonstrating what else he can do, and Peacock appears quite content to cash in on that. “Bupkis” is at times very funny, but when it comes to getting to know more about Pete Davidson, the show’s admirable qualities are more in spite of that than because of it.“Bupkis” premieres May 4 on Peacock.",entertainment,0.0
221,226,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/entertainment/star-wars-timeline-chronological-order-cec/index.html,"The ‘Star Wars’ timeline is confusing. Here’s when ‘The Mandalorian,’ ‘Ahsoka’ and more take place",2023-05-04 00:14:00,"“Star Wars” fans have much to look forward to in terms of new content.The problem? All the stories take place at different points of time in the galaxy far, far away. “The Mandalorian” is set between the original film trilogy and the latest sequels. “Andor” is a prequel to “Rogue One,” itself a prequel to “A New Hope.” And the forthcoming Disney+ series “The Acolyte” takes place hundreds of years before the Skywalker saga.Worry not, padawans: CNN has laid out a comprehensive timeline of the “Star Wars” canon so you can follow all of the franchise’s time-jumps without getting lost in space.These details are pulled from the official “Star Wars” resources “Ultimate Star Wars” and “Star Wars Character Encyclopedia,” as well as experts from outlets like USA Today and the AV Club. Omitted from this timeline are anthology series like “Star Wars Visions.”Many “Star Wars” diehards mark the passage of time in the galaxy by the Battle of Yavin, the fateful fight in “A New Hope” in which the first iteration of the Death Star is destroyed. “The Phantom Menace” takes place more than 30 years before this battle. But for “Star Wars” fans who are still working out the differences between the Republic, the Rebellion and the Resistance, we’ll measure in plain old Earth time.The Skywalker saga begins! Anakin Skywalker is around 9 years old when we meet him in the first prequel film. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Padawan to Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin, who’s obsessed with young Anakin’s off-the-charts midi-chlorian count. Darth Maul, pupil of Sith double agent Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious, kills Qui-Gon and is cut in half by Obi-Wan (though he appears in animated series and cameos in “Solo” with mechanical spider legs). Anakin also meets the teenage queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, with whom he falls in love.If Anakin is 9 when we meet him in ‘The Phantom Menace,” then “Attack of the Clones” takes place around a decade later, according to USA Today. Our hero has grown up into a whiny, troublemaking teenager who tends to break rules (like marrying Padmé, now a galactic senator) and generally irritate his Jedi Master, Obi-Wan, who loves him like a pesky younger brother. The Republic is starting to crumble under the influence of separatists like Count Dooku, a former Jedi turned Sith, and the Republic makes use of a Clone army to keep the galaxy together (for a short while).This animated series is mostly set between “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith” (during which about three years pass). This series ends at the same time “Revenge of the Sith” does – fan-favorite heroine Ahsoka Tano leaves the Jedi Order and barely escapes Order 66, the command that turns nearly every clone in the galaxy to Darth Sidious’ side thanks to chips implanted in their skulls.So, that Clone Army? Yeah, it didn’t take long for them to turn on the Jedi – about three years after “Attack of the Clones,” or as long as it takes Anakin to grow out his hair. In this dark installment, Sidious executes Order 66 and snuffs out almost all living Jedi. Anakin commits to the Dark Side full-time, adopting the moniker of Darth Vader. Padmé dies shortly after giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia, who are separated and kept secret from Vader. Palpatine/Sidious is now emperor, and the reign of the Empire begins.Several of Disney’s most recent “Star Wars” series take place in between “Revenge of the Sith” and “A New Hope,” when the Empire runs the galaxy with an iron fist and surviving Jedi live in hiding.This animated series takes place in the immediate aftermath of Order 66, impacting nearly every clone except for the members of the “Bad Batch,” rogues whose quirks separate them from the rest of the clones – one is a tech wiz, another is a hulking strongman, yet another is a young girl. Unlike the rest of the clone army, the chips in their brains malfunctioned so they didn’t blindly start murdering Jedi under Sidious’ command – and their individuality makes them targets of the Empire.We meet the beloved scoundrel Han Solo as a teen in “Solo,” initially as an orphan trained to pilfer. Thrillist surmised that “Solo” must take place about eight or nine years after “Revenge of the Sith,” since Han is a few years older than Luke and Leia, and would have needed time to develop galaxy-wide infamy. We also, crucially, meet Han’s cape-loving frenemy, Lando Calrissian.About a decade has passed since the events of “Revenge of the Sith”: Luke and Leia are around 10 years old; Darth Vader employs Force-sensitive Inquisitors to hunt Obi-Wan; and our favorite Jedi Master is floundering on Tatooine. Bail Organa tasks Obi-Wan with recovering Leia, his adopted daughter, and the young princess finally meets the Jedi master she’ll call upon at the beginning of “A New Hope.” This reignites Obi-Wan’s hope in the Skywalker children and the future of the galaxy they’ll inherit.A ragtag team of former Jedi, a Mandalorian native, a rambunctious droid and top-notch pilots make up some of the first members of the fledgling rebellion. Their animated adventures take place about 14 years after the events of the “Clone Wars” series, per Den of Geek, and conclude just before “A New Hope” begins.This series introduces the “Rogue One” rebel Cassian Andor when he was still a nonbeliever. But over the course of the season, set about 14 years after “Revenge of the Sith” and around five years before “Rogue One,” per the AV Club, we witness Andor’s radicalization as he becomes a leader of the rebellion. We also see Mon Mothma use her position as a wealthy senator to cover her secret funding of the rebellion’s efforts.The action of “Rogue One” takes place in the weeks leading up to “A New Hope.” In it, Jyn Erso, whose father was forced by the Empire to develop the Death Star, joins the Rebellion in an effort to retrieve the plans to eventually destroy the Death Star. Along with Cassian Andor, the droid K-2SO and an Imperial pilot turncoat, Jyn dies but successfully sends the plans to the Rebel fleet. “Rogue One” ends just moments after Darth Vader boards Princess Leia’s ship and the Alderanean adoptee records her fateful message to Obi-Wan, delivered by R2-D2.The films that started it all, these three are situated smack-dab in the middle of the Skywalker saga, starring Anakin and Padmé’s kids.Many “Star Wars” fans believe Luke and Leia are around 19 during “A New Hope,” meaning the film takes place nearly two decades after “Revenge of the Sith.” Luke is called to adventure on Tatooine after the droid R2-D2, formerly part of Luke’s late mother’s Naboo crew, transmits a message for Obi-Wan (or Old Ben, as he’s called by Luke and others). Vader defeats Obi-Wan – or does he? – and the Rebels destroy the Death Star in the Battle of Yavin.About three years after “A New Hope,” per USA Today, Luke begins his Jedi training on Dagobah with a batty old Yoda. Lando double-crosses Han, who winds up frozen in carbonite. And Luke faces off against Darth Vader, during which he loses a hand and learns that the Sith Lord is, in fact, his father. Yikes!And one year after Luke gets his hand sliced off, Leia and Han escape the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. Yoda, at the ripe age of 900, finally dies. And Vader kills Sidious and redeems himself shortly before dying and earning Luke’s respect. The film ends on the Forest Moon of Endor, where our heroes (and an army of Ewoks) defeat the Empire once and for all.At least two Disney+ series are set in the previously unexplored time period of the post-Empire, pre-First Order galaxy.When we meet Mando and Grogu, the New Republic is technically leading the Galaxy after the Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Endor. But we soon learn how lawless much of the galaxy, particularly the Outer Rim, remains. And while the New Republic’s bureaucratic progress moves at a glacial pace, former imperials are forming a new evil superpower – a fascist government that will eventually become the First Order and take over the galaxy.This miniseries about the once-inept bounty hunter flitted back and forth through time, from the period after Boba escaped the Sarlacc pit in “Return of the Jedi” to Din Jarin’s adventures in “The Mandalorian.” It’s also in this series that we see Grogu training with Luke and Ahsoka before abandoning his studies to rejoin his adopted dad. Boba, meanwhile, fills the power vacuum left by Jabba the Hutt.The final three films in the Skywalker saga (for now, that is) take place in a tighter period of time than its predecessors: According to USA Today, all of them take place within the same year. That means, within that time, Rey connects with the Force, Kylo Ren becomes Supreme Leader, Darth Sidious returns, the First Order is soundly defeated and Han, Luke and Leia die. Phew!About 30 years have passed since the Battle of Endor, per USA Today. Leia, now a general with the Resistance, and Han have a son, Kylo Ren, whom many fans believe is not yet 30 years old when we meet him. According to the “Star Wars Character Encyclopedia,” Rey, an enterprising orphan on the desert planet Jakku, is 19, the same age as Luke in “A New Hope.” After she befriends former stormtrooper Finn and discovers her Force sensitivity, she faces Kylo, who kills his father.“The Last Jedi” begins moments after the end of “The Force Awakens,” when Rey finds Luke on the island planet Ahch-To and he promptly tosses his lightsaber. He reveals that he took on a teenage Kylo Ren, his nephew, as a tutee. That ended poorly – Kylo absconded with some of Luke’s other pupils and killed the rest, destroying Luke’s hope in the future of the Jedi. Luke dies at the end of the film, Leia leads a small Rebel cell to safety and Kylo kills Snoke, the series’ villainous MacGuffin, to save Rey.The final chapter of the Skywalker saga sees the surviving Skywalkers die: Leia passes in peace and Kylo sacrifices himself for Rey. Oh, and the clone of Emperor Palpatine (who somehow returned) dies, too, or so we’re led to believe. Rey, who’s told by the zombified Sith Lord that she’s a Palpatine, too, adopts the Skywalker moniker.There are a few new “Star Wars” films and series in the works. One film covers the dawn of the Jedi and another will tie up the various storylines started in “The Mandalorian” and “Ahsoka,” and Jude Law will star in a mysterious show called “Skeleton Crew.” We have a better idea of what the following films and series entail.Details on this series, set to debut sometime in 2024, are slim, but showrunner Leslye Headland did let slip that the series takes place about 100 years before the events of “Phantom Menace.” Maybe we’ll see a young, spry Yoda in his late 700s or early 800s?This series, premiering in August, takes place around five years after the end of “Return of the Jedi,” according to Rotten Tomatoes, and stars many live-action versions of characters from “Star Wars Rebels,” like Sabine Wren, Hera Syndulla and Grand Admiral Thrawn. This series, then, is likely set around the same time as “The Mandalorian.”Rey returns! Daisy Ridley will reprise her role in an upcoming film that sees her trying to rebuild the Jedi Order about 15 years after “The Rise of Skywalker,” per Variety.

At its best, it’s a lightweight companion to “All the President’s Men,” presenting the flip side of all that planning and frantic covering up by what amounted to Keystone Criminals.Woody Harrelson and Justin Theroux portray E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, the two minor players in the bigger scheme of things that masterminded the plot. The pair sought to ingratiate themselves to the Nixon administration with a bag of “dirty tricks” to help ensure his reelection, leading to Watergate and breaking into the office of Vietnam whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg’s psychologist.If Hunt, a father of three, was leading a life of quiet desperation when this opportunity reared its head, Liddy represented the sort of gung-ho true believer convinced the end – which is to say, “Saving the country from Communism” – justifies any means, and that the ultimate goal is “proximity to power.”High-ranking White House officials, meanwhile, including John Dean (Domhnall Gleeson) and Attorney General John Mitchell (John Carroll Lynch), were understandably skeptical at first, but eventually gave the greenlight to some of the clandestine operations. Yet as Hunt and Liddy descended deeper into the abyss, they kept hitting absurd snags, while prompting Hunt’s wife (“Game of Thrones’” Lena Headey) to distrust Liddy, who plays recordings of Hitler speeches and keeps offering to do that thing where he holds his hand over a burning flame.“The sooner you’re done with this guy the better,” she tells Hunt, who shares those sentiments about half the time, while going along with Liddy the rest.Directed by “Veep” producer David Mandel from a script by Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck, “White House Plumbers” approaches the material in a satirical manner, and makes some clever and shrewd choices, including a particularly amusing nod to “All the President’s Men.”Even allowing for the dramatic liberties taken with the facts, the whole exercise sort of rises and falls on Theroux’s cartoonish portrayal of the flamboyant Liddy, which could easily be seen as an absurd exaggeration except for the fact that he really was a beyond-eccentric character, parlaying his association with Watergate into a radio show and acting appearances (it’s noted textually that he guest starred on “Miami Vice”) after his release from prison.At five parts, “White House Plumbers” meanders a bit in the buildup to the break-in, luxuriating in the trappings of the period and Hunt’s fractious family life while depicting its principals doing unbelievably stupid things, like bragging to a stewardess about their covert activities. The story gains momentum in its aftermath and the coverup that followed, testing the value of the loyalty to Richard Nixon (seen only in news clips) that Liddy preaches with messianic zeal.Much of the narrative brings to mind the quote attributed to Deep Throat (a.k.a. Mark Felt, played here, briefly, by “Veep’s” Gary Cole) in “All the President’s Men,” in which he tells Bob Woodward, “The truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.”“White House Plumbers” occasionally feels like it has gotten out of hand too, attributable in part to the stranger-than-fiction aspects of the story. On that level the project works primarily as a companion to a rich trove of Watergate-related cinematic fare, but like Hunt and Liddy, when held up next to that roster it relatively looks like a minor-league player.“White House Plumbers” premieres May 1 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

This 24-minute episode showed Corden taking McCartney to memorable places from his childhood in Liverpool, including a barber shop and a florist. At one point, the two visit his childhood home where the Beatle shows Corden where he used to pen songs with John Lennon.

The two belt out “Hello” and “Someone Like You.” When Adele performs Nicki Minaj’s “Monster” verse brilliantly, it’s an amazing surprise.Adele also appeared on the last “Carpool Karaoke,” where she thanked Corden for being such a good friend.Mariah Carey practices her accents, wears giant sunglasses, a butterfly ring, a driving glove, and delivers pure diva perfection in this episode.Corden credits Carey with boosting the show high enough to start getting him A-listers. Their duet of “Vision of Love” is a treasure.The two drive around Los Angeles in the rain, and Codren gets the singer to admit his biggest tantrum was when he asked someone to make the wind stop blowing. They end the trip with an epic rendition of “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down On Me.”If you’ve ever wondered who has the best celebrity contact list in Hollywood, Corden determines it’s Jennifer Lopez.After snooping through her phone and seeing Bradley Cooper and Cristiano Ronaldo listed, he lands on Leonardo DiCaprio, texting him “Hey Baby” and signing it “J.Lo, you know, from the block.”As they drive around New York, Madonna sings “Vogue” and puts her feet on the ceiling. Worth the watch for that alone.Then first lady Michelle Obama joined Corden for a drive around the White House grounds, singing along to Stevie Wonder and Beyoncé.Obama performing the “Single Ladies” dance is a hightlight.

225,230,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/25/entertainment/fatal-attraction-review/index.html,‘Fatal Attraction’ doesn’t come close to the original with its series reboot,"09:38 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","“Fatal Attraction” was very much a product of its time, so an attempt to cash in on the title – as Paramount+ does with a new version – absolutely needed to reconsider and reimagine the material. Yet the eight-part series awkwardly draped over its bones is a beyond-busy murder mystery, one that – with apologies to one of the film’s signature lines – can easily be ignored.As it happens, “Fatal Attraction” arrives the same week another streaming show with a very similar framework, “Saint X,” makes its debut on Hulu. Both jump around in time, hinge on the mysterious death of a young woman and build, too slowly, toward revealing what really happened, relying on an abundance of twists to tease out the story.The former starts with one of the most popular movies of the late 1980s, which famously scared men about infidelity thanks to Glenn Close’s alluring and then obsessed and increasingly dangerous stalker, mixing eroticism, horror and no small amount of sexism, with a memorable pinch of animal cruelty for good measure.The series updates that artifact in a number of ways – a few of them logical, one (yes) having to do with a bunny, but most merely perplexing. Specifically, it begins with Dan Gallagher (Joshua Jackson), a Los Angeles prosecutor, doing time for the murder of Alex Forrest (Lizzy Caplan), a co-worker with whom he had engaged in a steamy affair before things went very, very sideways.Relying primarily on hairstyles to designate the 15-year gap as it oscillates between then and now, the show begins with Dan being passed over for a promotion – he thinks he’s a lock to become a judge – which, as constructed, puts him in the mindset to risk his life with his wife, Beth (Amanda Peet), and their young daughter Ellen (Vivien Lyra Blair, recently seen in “Obi-Wan Kenobi”) by stepping out with Alex when the two are away.Flash forward, and Dan is just getting out of prison, said daughter is now a young woman (played at that age by Alyssa Jirrels) wrestling with her family history, and Beth has moved on. Meanwhile, Dan and his pal Mike (Toby Huss) seek to reopen their investigation, trying to determine what really happened to Alex and potentially clear his name.Executive producer Alexandra Cunningham (“Dirty John”) capitalizes on the more-expansive format to flesh out a lot of details, more organically developing the relationship and Alex’s side of the story as well as her past. The series also still weaves in touches that defined the movie, from Alex and Dan’s trysts to her famous warning, “I’m not going to be ignored.”Still, the understandable attempt to bring “Fatal Attraction” into the 2020s – as Paramount recently did, more successfully, with “Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies” – feels more tortured than most reboots (see the recent “Dead Ringers” as another example), padding on new characters and improbable wrinkles.Perhaps foremost, it takes what feels like an awfully long time to get to the not-terribly-satisfying payoff, despite solid work by Jackson and Caplan, who were both better served by the erotic series “The Affair” and “Masters of Sex,” respectively.In the original, Alex told Dan as the sexual tension built between them, “You’re here with a strange girl being a naughty boy.” There’s still some naughtiness in this incarnation, but it’s more guilty of being a boring boy than anything else.The same criticisms largely apply to “Saint X,” an adaptation of Alexis Schaitkin’s novel, which begins with the promising premise of how a “missing White woman” story unfolded, reflecting the media fascination with such tales and the toll on those swept up in its orbit.Specifically, that includes guests and staff at the Caribbean resort where college-student Alison (West Duchovny, David Duchovny and Téa Leoni’s daughter) went missing, and particularly the lingering effects on her much-younger sister, Emily, who as an adult (played by “Fear the Walking Dead’s” Alicia Debnam-Carey) begins nosing around for answers as to what really transpired.Loosely inspired by the Natalee Holloway case, the issues of class and race – illustrated through the prism of two hotel employees, well played by Josh Bonzie and Jayden Elijah – feel overwhelmed here by the emphasis on Emily’s ill-advised attempt to play Nancy Drew; Alison’s “stupid tourist” behavior, despite her protestations to the contrary; and an ending that doesn’t justify the trip.Complaining that such mystery series meander too much has become a familiar gripe, but that doesn’t make it any less true. Like “The White Lotus,” “Saint X” sets up provocative upstairs/downstairs themes in an inviting location, but unlike that HBO show, it’s a relatively poor destination for an eight-episode stay.“Fatal Attraction” premieres April 30 on Paramount+.“Saint X” premieres April 26 on Hulu.",entertainment,0.0

She looks at Ava as selfish; she doesn’t want to be there.

228,233,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/14/entertainment/yellowjackets-90s-music/index.html,"‘Yellowjackets’ leans hard into ’90s music nostalgia, and we’re here for it",2023-05-01 19:02:00,"Of the many dark gifts Showtime’s eerie hit series “Yellowjackets” serves up for us, the juiciest this season is by far the music.The show – which bounces between a troupe of teen soccer players trapped in the 1990s Canadian wilderness after a plane crash and the survivors’ corresponding adult selves in the present day – embraces nostalgia, incorporating long-cherished tunes from the tail end of last century, with staples from Tori Amos, early Smashing Pumpkins, Massive Attack, Veruca Salt and much more.In Sunday’s episode of “Yellowjackets,” alt-rock queen Alanis Morissette will debut a version of the show’s theme song, “No Return,” and has already released it as a single.One of the most unexpected and successful uses of throwback music came in the first episode of Season 2 last month, when Warren Kole’s Jeff had a moment to himself in the car after an intense tryst with wife Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) – during which he rocks out hard to Papa Roach’s “Last Resort” (sure, the track actually came out in 2000, but that doesn’t take away from its retro vibe).In an interview with CNN, the show’s music supervisor, Nora Felder, explained that the Papa Roach song selection was scripted, and “served as a perfect physical outlet for Warren whose anxious feelings were riding high while sitting alone in his garage.”Other standout moments in the script, however, are hers to interpret, and Felder relishes the opportunity to match those moments with the right songs from the period.“I re-immerse myself into the show’s era and spirit of the times as I start to build my playlists for the show,” she said. “The main thing I try to keep in mind is to just stay true to the story and let it tell me what it might need musically.”Case in point, from the same episode – the placement of Amos’s signature track “Cornflake Girl,” off her groundbreaking 1994 sophomore album “Under the Pink.”The song – which appropriately has the lyric “Things are getting kind of gross” just as teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) is about to ingest something unthinkable – “came to mind pretty quickly as a possibility” to Felder.“I felt that Amos’s lyrics could serve as a befitting launchpad for the first episode’s ending – not only as a reflection of Young Shauna’s state of mind,” she noted, “but also as a reflection of the past and present moods and mentalities lived out by the other ‘Yellowjackets’ characters in Season 2.”Felder’s work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something technical or because the needs of the scene evolve during production, as a result of many elements, including the actors’ performances.“Everyone on the team always wants the best song-select possible to enhance the story,” she said. “When we get to post (production), the common question that comes up among us during the collaboration process is simply, ‘Do we think we can beat this?’”During that collaborative process, Felder says she doesn’t “believe there is an exact roadmap into how to merge songs with any given scene or story.”“I always say, ‘Let the picture tell you what it needs.’ (Kind of like the Wilderness I guess?)”Another moment that feels perfectly melded to the music playing is the now-infamous ‘last supper’ scene from last week’s second episode, which boasts Radiohead’s “Climbing By The Walls” from their mindblowing 1995 album “OK Computer” on the soundtrack.“The song seems to refer to those unspeakable monsters that can live in one’s head,” Felder noted, referencing the strange collective hallucinations the group undergoes while cannibalizing one of their own. “I can’t think of a more perfect way to hauntingly accent (that) scene, a.k.a. ‘the feast.’”To drive home just how important music is to the specific ambient feel of “Yellowjackets,” one need look no further than the super creepy Season 2 trailer for the show, which features Florence + The Machine’s exceptional and haunting rendition of No Doubt’s timeless 1995 hit, “Just A Girl.”“I’m such a huge fan of ‘Yellowjackets’ and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a ‘deeply unsettling’ way for show,” band frontwoman Florence Welch said in a statement shared with CNN.“We tried to really add some horror elements to this iconic song to fit the tone of the show. And as someone who’s first musical love was pop punk and Gwen Stefani, it was a dream job.”Of her collaboration with “Yellowjackets,” Morrisette, too, felt inspired by the show.“I see parallels between ‘Yellowjackets’ and my perspective while songwriting: the sheer intensity, that going for the jugular with no fear around going for the profane,” Morissette said in a statement. “I’ve strived my entire career to support the empowerment of women and sensitives, and see the world through the female lens, and what’s so wonderful about this show is that each character is allowed to be dynamic and complex as opposed to oversimplified, reduced versions of women. I feel honoured to be a part of the legacy of ‘Yellowjackets.’”",style,0.0

(HBO and CNN are part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)Rothwell was nominated for an Emmy in 2022 for her performance as Belinda in the debut season of “White Lotus,” and is also known for her role as Kelli Prenny in HBO’s “Insecure.”Season 1 of “White Lotus” centered on a group of guests on vacation at an exclusive Hawaiian resort. Starring Coolidge, Rothwell, Murray Bartlett, Jake Lacey, Alexandra Daddario, Steve Zahn, Sydney Sweeney and Connie Britton, among others, the freshman season was an instant hit and explored themes of classism, family dynamics and money against the backdrop of the scenic, splashy resort.Coolidge’s Tanya, a wealthy heiress, found herself at the resort in Season 1 following the death of her mother, and after a successful therapeutic massage session with Belinda, became obsessed with the idea of bankrolling the wellness practitioner’s business venture. Belinda reluctantly went along with the proposal, only to be burned by Tanya who left the resort with her empty promises at the season’s conclusion.After Season 2’s Sicily-set antics last year, which also featured Tanya (as well as her simultaneously tragic and hilarious death), Season 3 of the hit series is said to be set in Thailand.While plot details are still tightly under wraps for Season 3, according to White, it will take a “satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality.”A release date for “White Lotus” Season 3 has yet to be announced.",entertainment,0.0

As evidence look no further than “Eternals,” another super-team that (while meriting an asterisk due to the pandemic) didn’t fare nearly as well.The key to Gunn’s earlier movies relied on a mix of abundant visual energy, distinctive characters, cleverly incorporated songs and no small amount of sheer goofiness. All of that is on full display in “Vol. 3,” as well as a darker thread that delves heavily into the past of Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), the unnaturally savvy and bloodthirsty anthropomorphic raccoon, conveying an unexpectedly poignant animal-rights message in the process.This “Guardians” begins with Quill (Chris Pratt) having become an emotional wreck because of his estrangement from Gamora (Zoe Saldaña), who returned post-blip with no memory of their relationship. He’s jolted from his misery, however, by a threat that forces the team to leap into action to save one of their own, which includes facing off against one of the more visually striking comics characters, Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), a creature with enormous power but an almost-childlike mind.Reinforcing the sense of the movie serving as an extended curtain call, Gunn – who, remember, was fired from the project over social-media posts, and later reinstated – repeatedly highlights the depth of the bond between key players, in a way that perhaps more than anything brings to mind “Toy Story 3.” Yet “Guardians” also revels in broadly comic exchanges between the hulking Drax (Dave Bautista), empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and serious Nebula (Karen Gillan), often approximating the banter of squabbling siblings.That playfulness – recently illustrated by the “Guardians” holiday special – extends to the seemingly unlimited song budget, which has moved beyond Quill clinging to his childhood to setting an overall mood of warmth and nostalgia.Other than being a bit too busy, and a little too long, the main quibbles would be somewhat underusing Warlock and the generic nature of the principal bad guy, a ruthless madman known as the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), although the villains have been a weak link throughout. The closing-credit sequences also fall in the barely-worth-sitting-through category.Still, after some second-guessing about Marvel’s invulnerability thanks to disappointing results (creatively as well as commercially) for “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and to a lesser degree the “Black Panther” sequel, “Guardians” feels like a return to form on both fronts. And if it does close the books, at least for a while, on this series, give Gunn credit for bidding a fond farewell with both barrels blazing.“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” premieres May 5 in US theaters.

It’s Me, Margaret’ is a heaven-sent version of Judy Blume’s book","09:38 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","“Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” is a classic coming-of-age tale, but the Judy Blume book receives the ageless treatment it deserves in a movie that captures the 1970 vibe (starting with the soundtrack) while completely transcending it. Sweet, charming and thoughtful, this theatrical release will likely land on a streaming service sooner than later, but it appears destined to have a very, very long shelf life.Writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig’s film debut, “The Edge of Seventeen,” turned out to be a terrific training ground for this tween version of youthful angst, and a protagonist who – having been raised without any religion by her Christian mom (Rachel McAdams) and Jewish dad (Benny Safdie) – seeks help from God when the family abruptly decides to relocate from New York to New Jersey.“Don’t let New Jersey be too horrible,” Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson, previously featured in “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” giving a giant-sized performance) pleads before embarking on the move, which, among other things, greatly upsets her paternal grandmother (Kathy Bates, yet again guilty of scene-stealing larceny).Beyond leaving her school and friends behind, Margaret enters this strange new suburban world at a critical phase in her life, falling into the circle of a domineering girl, Nancy (Elle Graham), whose prodding makes Margaret even more obsessed with the vagaries of puberty. That isn’t helped when Nancy coaxes her to steal her dad’s Playboy, fueling anxieties about a body that isn’t developing at the rate she wishes.“Are You There God?” could easily drift into after-school special territory, but it has more edge than that. For starters, Margaret’s exploration of religion – which drove a wedge between her mom, Barbara, and her parents – helps elevate it, as does the parallel plot about Barbara trying to fit in among the PTA mothers and fretting about her domestic skills.While the songs and styles set the period mood, the subject matter possesses a universal and timeless quality, from the awkwardness of watching sex-education videos to the discomfort associated with that first crush.Produced by James L. Brooks’ company, which has a long association with these kind of character-driven films, “Are You There God?” feels like a throwback to another era of entertainment as well. Such movies have struggled of late at the box office, and this certainly isn’t the kind of fare that tends to cause people to rush out to theaters these days (although mothers and daughters looking for quality bonding time, in particular, could do a whole lot worse).Still, despite all her tween misery, “Margaret” should make some streaming service very happy. Because for an audience seeking something that doesn’t speak down to kids, or anyone who can remember being one, “Are You There God?” addresses youthful preoccupations in a refreshingly relatable manner that feels almost heaven-sent.“Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” premieres April 28 in US theaters. It’s rated PG-13.",entertainment,0.0

(Shannon last played the extraterrestrial baddie in 2016’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.”)One of the more galvanizing interludes of the trailer displays Keaton, dressed neck-down in his iconic Batsuit complete with the iconic black and yellow Batman logo, uttering dialog last spoken in 1989’s seminal “Batman” film when he matched wits with Jack Nicholson’s evil and zany Joker:“You wanna get nuts?

Pictures, Gosling said that “up until this point, I only knew Ken from afar. I didn’t know Ken from within.”“I doubted my Ken-ergy. I didn’t see it,” he said, later adding that his co-star Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig ultimately “conjured” the Ken doll out of him.Upon landing the role, Gosling underwent a physical transformation that is still being showcased with his frosty bleached-blonde hair and uber-bronzed skin to embody the plastic mind of Ken.“I was living my life and the next thing I knew, I was bleaching my hair and shaving my legs and rollerblading on Venice Beach,” Gosling joked.He added that he’d often find himself asking why there was self-tanner on his bed sheets and likened this transformation to being overtaken by what he called “pink fever,” as if he had been sweating Barbie through his pores.As far as Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, her partner and “Barbie” co-writer, were concerned, there was nobody else they felt more suited for the role than Gosling, despite his initial trepidation. Gerwig told the CinemaCon audience that while they were writing the script, they went so far as to write Gosling’s name in for Ken as if they’d already cast him in their minds without knowing him.Gosling certainly showed support for his director, as he attended the panel wearing a pink jacket over a white t-shirt with text in the signature Barbie font that read “Greta Gerwig.”Robbie, who plays Barbie in the film, said during the panel that walking onto the set of the project was “like a dopamine hit” every day. Grown men even found excuses to step onto set – including the guys from the “Fast X” set who were filming on the same lot – Robbie said.In addition to the fun, fun, fun CinemaCon panel discussion, new clips from the movie were presented and gave viewers a wider glimpse at Barbie Land, which Gerwig had mentioned she wanted to look and be as “tactile” as possible, like the Mattel toys themselves.The snippet also further introduced SNL alum Kate McKinnon’s “Weird Barbie” character, who has a chopped up haircut, is in a permanent leg split and smells “like basement.”The “Barbie” movie will premiere in theaters on July 21.

Modest narrative upgrades help lift the Disney+ film above the service’s recent “Pinocchio,” but clearing that very low bar amounts to damnation with faint praise.There have been numerous live-action renderings of J.M. Barrie’s classic, from “Hook” to “Peter Pan” to simply “Pan” – plus “Finding Neverland,” which cast Johnny Depp as Barrie in a touching look at the play’s origins.Other than a few welcome and necessary changes to rid the Disney animated film of more problematic elements, and a bit more backstory explaining this Captain Hook (Jude Law) and his semi-depressed demeanor, this version pretty closely adheres to the basic blueprint, pondering that age-old question about children’s reluctance to grow up.Wendy (Ever Anderson) says as much when her mother (Molly Parker) chides her for clinging to childhood, telling her mom tartly, “What if I don’t want your life?” Yet that rather philosophical conundrum quickly gives way to the arrival of Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) and Tinkerbell (Yara Shahidi, making the most of a near-silent role), who whisk Wendy and her brothers off to Neverland.Pan’s Lost Boys (some of whom are girls) receive somewhat short shrift in this telling, while Tiger Lily (Alyssa Wapanatâhk) has a more enhanced role. Indeed, by giving Wendy a more active part in the heroics indicative of the title change, this movie features more female empowerment all around, dispensing with much of the petty jealousy and girlish mooning over Peter that didn’t age particularly well during the last 70 years.Still, there’s only so much that “The Green Knight” director David Lowery (who shares script credit with Toby Halbrooks) can do within the confines of toeing the Disney line, and even believing in fairies can’t bring the movie to consistent life.While there are snippets of the original music, the film forgoes songs other than a few shanties the pirates croon when not trying to kill Pan and his mates. That said, the action is reasonably tame, other than the sheer size of the crocodile, who fleetingly demonstrates why Hook is rightly terrified of it.Disney has obviously made live-action remakes of its animated properties a staple of its creative arsenal, flitting between more ambitious theatrical productions (see “Aladdin,” “Beauty and the Beast” and the upcoming “The Little Mermaid”) and those sent straight to streaming (among them the aforementioned “Pinocchio” and “Lady and the Tramp”).Yet the obvious appeal of introducing or reintroducing these stories to young audiences while allowing their parents to watch along works better if there’s some creative spark to invigorate the exercise, and maybe even hold the adults’ attention as opposed to letting them drift off to second screens (or dreamland).“Peter Pan & Wendy” isn’t a complete failure, but nor does this return to Neverland pass that test; rather, it’s another case of a Disney production that – unlike the beloved and venerable story that inspired it – never truly takes flight.“Peter Pan & Wendy” premieres April 28 on Disney+.

Born and raised in Hawaii, Agudong is mixed race. Though it is unclear if she has Hawaiian heritage, critics of the reported casting have focused on the issue of colorism – in the 2002 animated version, Nani has dark skin and distinctive indigenous features, while Agudong is light-skinned.Hawaii has the largest proportion of multiracial people in the nation, and because of the history of colonialism on the islands, it’s common for residents to be a combination of White, Asian and Native Hawaiian. That means there are plenty of Hawaiians with lighter skin, and having lighter skin doesn’t make a person less Hawaiian, said OniMasai Connor, who lives in Oahu and is Black and Hawaiian.But by choosing a light-skinned actor to play a character who originally had dark skin, Disney is reinforcing deep-rooted notions about what features are considered acceptable or beautiful in society, she added.“My issue with the casting is the fact that we live in a supremacist society that favors light skin, therefore this casting contributes to a level of erasure,” she wrote in a message to CNN. “We see so often in all genres of cinema – stories based on people that are dark skinned in real life, only to be played by someone lighter in a film.”Disney, as well as representatives for Agudong, have not responded to requests for comment.The new “Lilo & Stitch” is based on an animated film and Nani is a fictional, animated character. But unlike “The Little Mermaid,” which is rooted in mythology despite receiving racist backlash over Halle Bailey’s casting in the live-action remake, “Lilo & Stitch” draws from a very real culture and people.Nani and Lilo’s Hawaiian identity, as well as their skin tone, are important to the story, Connor and others said. For example, one scene from the animated film sees Nani characterize the luau where she works as a “stupid, fakey luau” – a nod to how the tourism industry has exploited Native Hawaiian people and their customs.“Nani working at the ‘fakey luau’ alone and even using the phrase ‘fakey luau’ to describe that job was an aggressively political statement, involving colorism, indigeneity and the specific history of colonialism the US has imposed upon the nation of Hawaii,” one Twitter user wrote.Another major plot point of the film revolves around Nani’s precarious economic situation. Nani has been Lilo’s sole caretaker ever since their parents died in a car crash. But as Lilo’s companion Stitch causes chaos at her various places of employment, Nani struggles to hold down a job and is repeatedly warned by a social worker that she could lose custody of her sister. The storyline echoes the real-life crisis of Native children being removed from their homes, as well as the racial disparities in the US child welfare system.“The conflict occurring in Lilo and Stitch being about the colonialist state attempting to pull this tiny ‘broken’ native Hawaiian family apart is made more apparent by their both being darker skinned girls,” another Twitter user wrote. “Casting a lighter skinned Hawaiian to play Nani interferes with that.”Colorism has long been a problem in Hollywood and the broader entertainment industry – stars such as Viola Davis and Lupita Nyong’o have been vocal about losing opportunities over their dark skin, while others including Zendaya and Thandiwe Newton have acknowledged the privileges that come with having lighter skin.The live-action “Lilo & Stitch” is only the latest in a long line of projects that have faced accusations of colorism. A similar conversation took place over Disney’s live-action remake of “Aladdin” when Naomi Scott, who is of mixed English and Indian descent, was cast as Princess Jasmine.“Why is it that, when casting the wife of a terrorist or extra number four in shows like Jack Ryan or Homeland, it seems easy enough to find a dark brown or Middle Eastern woman for the role, but when casting a Disney princess, directors and casting agents are stumped?” Erum Salam wrote in a 2019 piece for The Guardian.Similarily, the “Gossip Girl” reboot was criticized over the fact that all of its Black stars were light-skinned, while Lin-Manuel Miranda’s film adaptation of “In the Heights” also got heat for its lack of dark-skinned, Afro-Latinx actors in leading roles. (“Gossip Girl” was rebooted on HBO Max, while “In the Heights” was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Both companies share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.)Connor said she’s concerned that casting a light-skinned actor in the role of Nani in “Lilo & Stitch” will further misperceptions of what Hawaiians look like. As a Black and Hawaiian woman, she’s often felt that others don’t see her as Hawaiian because of her skin tone. That’s why seeing a darker-skinned actor play Nani would have been meaningful.“The question really isn’t, ‘Is she enough?’ It is ‘Am I enough?’ and that is so unfortunate considering the original animation did such a wonderful job at making ALL of us feel seen, no matter the skin tone,” Connor wrote. “It’s truly a loss, at no fault of Agudong herself.”Agudong isn’t to blame for systemic problems that have long plagued the industry, Connor said. Though Connor is disappointed, she hopes the “Lilo & Stitch” remake will otherwise stay true to the original, which she loved so much growing up. And she said she’s still looking forward to seeing the film when it’s released.",entertainment,0.0

Throw in clever cameos and this Apple TV+ movie delivers on its promise of unpretentious fun.“Ghosted” offers a reminder that Evans possessed considerable appeal (including his work as a romantic interest in “The Nanny Diaries”) before he picked up Captain America’s shield, and de Armas has super-spy credentials from the James Bond movie “No Time to Die” and “The Gray Man,” one of her previous collaborations (along with the more successful “Knives Out”) with Evans.Director Dexter Fletcher (“Rocketman”) relies on the natural chemistry between the two to carry the simple premise, which begins with the unassuming Cole (Evans), who works on his family farm, meeting de Armas’ alluring Sadie, arguing with her about whether she has what it takes to raise a houseplant. From there, the pair go on one very long, very good first date.Coming off a breakup, Cole is understandably smitten, and wounded when she doesn’t immediately respond to his texts. So with encouragement from his parents (Amy Sedaris and Tate Donovan), and ignoring his sister’s warning that he “came on way too strong,” he impulsively tracks a left-behind item of his to her location in London, where the surprise turns out to be on him, as Sadie is quickly revealed to be a clandestine operative for the CIA.Moreover, shades of “North by Northwest,” the bad guys, led by Adrien Brody’s sneering villain, mistake Cole for the mysterious agent who has been mucking up their plans, dragging him into Sadie’s cloak-and-dagger quest for a dangerous bioweapon that Hitchcock used to refer to as a MacGuffin.Mostly, the spy shenanigans serve as a backdrop to the squabbling and making up that goes with Cole’s shock about Sadie’s secret life, the danger to which he has inadvertently exposed them both and the fact that everyone keeps telling the pair that they should “get a room” when they’re arguing.With a screenplay from the “Deadpool” team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” scribes Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, “Ghosted” exhibits a sense of playfulness throughout, with Evans appearing to relish the opportunity to portray an everyman thrust into all these heroic hijinks. (While they go to great lengths to stress that Cole wrestled in high school, in these bouts, as Sadie informs him, he can’t expect his out-for-blood opponents to tap out.)Frankly, the star power alone might have made “Ghosted” a reasonably solid box-office attraction, but with the movie heading directly to streaming – where just garnering attention is more than half the battle – it’s pretty much a slam dunk for the posters alone.Unlike the needy Cole, “Ghosted” doesn’t ask for anything more than a couple intermittently attentive hours of your time. Thanks to Evans and de Armas, it’s the sort of invitation that’s pretty hard to ignore.“Ghosted” premieres April 21 on Apple TV+.

This is equivalent to about 2,875 individual Celebrations chocolates.The ornamental shoulder pieces decorating the King’s uniform were modeled from individual Twix, Milky Way, Galaxy and Bounty chocolates, with the King’s collar made from Maltesers Teasers.One of each of the Celebrations chocolates, including Snickers, was used to create the medals on his chest.“What better way to celebrate this moment in British history than immortalising HM King Charles III using the nation’s ultimate sharing treat,” said Emily Owen, a senior brand manager at Celebrations, in the release, adding that the team are “delighted with how he looks.”“The team studied hours of footage of the King to capture his true likeness and the resemblance is uncanny. Celebrations is all about bringing people together and we are thrilled to be sharing this occasion with so many chocolate lovers up and down the country,” she added.The chocolate bust will be on display in the southeastern English town of Slough at Mars Wrigley UK HQ, the headquarters of Mars, which owns the Celebrations brand.

239,250,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/met-gala-2023-theme-hosts-guests/index.html,"Met Gala 2023: Everything we know about the theme, hosts and guests",2023-05-01 04:45:00,"The Met Gala is fast approaching. Tonight’s event is a mainstay on the calendars of celebrities, fashion’s elite and New York high society, the extravagant event. Officially called the Costume Institute Benefit, it takes place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the first Monday in May, with guests dressed in keeping with the gala’s theme (or ignoring it altogether).This year, the dress code is “In honor of Karl,” a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, the late fashion juggernaut with an indelible influence but controversial reputation. All eyes will be on the red carpet to see how guests interpret Lagerfeld’s complicated legacy — as well as if his beloved tortie cat, Choupette, will strut up the museum’s front steps.Co-chairing this year’s event are actors Michaela Coel and Penélope Cruz, tennis giant Roger Federer, singer Dua Lipa and, as always, Vogue’s editorial director Anna Wintour.Lagerfeld’s career will also be explored in the Costume Institute’s spring exhibition “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” opening to the public the following day.Serving as creative director of the storied French fashion house Chanel from 1983 until his death in February 2019, as well as the luxury Italian house Fendi from 1965, the German fashion designer loomed tall within the fashion industry. He left his mark on Chloé, Patou and Balmain as well over the course of his long career, working with each fashion house in different capacities (in addition to his own eponymous label), and has influenced countless others.His final Fendi collection was shown at Milan Fashion Week just days after his death, with models including Gigi and Bella Hadid and Kaia Gerber walking the runway. The following month, Cruz made her runway debut at his final Chanel presentation.Vintage throwbacks to Lagerfeld collections are likely to reign on Monday — as well as nods to his imitable suited-and-gloved personal style. Lagerfeld’s collections were not known for any one hallmark — besides luxury; he was revered for the transformative power he had at each house with which he worked. His oft-repeated yet unsavory quote on taking over the House of Chanel was: “Chanel is an institution, and you have to treat an institution like a wh**e — and then you get something out of her.”In his orbit were some of fashion and entertainment’s biggest names, including Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista, Claudia Schiffer, Pharrell, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell and Cara Delevingne, some of whom will undoubtedly walk the red carpet this year. Younger models who have carried the Chanel torch, passed down from their mothers, include Gerber (daughter to Cindy Crawford) and Lily Rose-Depp (daughter to Vanessa Paradis).Lagerfeld’s influence and star-making power was undeniable, but over the years he made a number of disparaging statements that upheld thin ideals or cast criticism on the #MeToo movement at a time when the fashion industry was facing a reckoning. Whether or not all Met Gala guests will emphasize Lagerfeld in a positive light, or choose to make more subversive statements, remains to be seen. Last year, as many showed up in opulent garments fit for the Gilded Era for the theme “Gilded Glamour” some celebrities, including Gabrielle Union and Riz Ahmed, opted to honor communities who were marginalized during the period of runaway American wealth.Last October, actor and body positivity advocate Jameela Jamil called the theme “a disappointing double standard” in the industry, pointing out on social media that Lagerfeld’s comments were recent. “It’s really weird when someone gets a completely free pass and I don’t want to be a part of that.”The gala’s themes are chosen based on the Costume Institute’s new exhibitions. While past themes have explored highly conceptual or region-specific motifs, from “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” in 2018 to “China: Through the Looking Glass” in 2015, individual designers have been honored, too. They’ve included Rei Kawakubo, who is still living, in 2017, and Alexander McQueen, the year after his death, in 2011.“A Line of Beauty” arrives more than two decades after a contentious failed collaboration between Lagerfeld and the museum, in which the designer’s retrospective of Coco Chanel was shelved — officially due to the recent death of the chief curator, though a New York Times report alluded to creative conflicts with Lagerfeld as well.“Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” will run at the Met’s Costume Institute through mid-July.Top image: Lagerfeld and Blake Lively at the Met Gala in 2011, which was dedicated to Alexander McQueen following his death.",style,0.0

241,253,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/rana-plaza-garment-worker-rights-accord/index.html,"10 years after Rana Plaza, is Bangladesh’s garment industry any safer?","09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Trade union leader Babul Akhter was working at Bangladesh’s labor ministry in Dhaka on the morning that Rana Plaza, a nine-story building crammed with garment factories, collapsed. He rushed to the scene in Savar district, around 20 miles outside the capital. There he heard the cries of trapped workers emanating from the rubble — a muffled cacophony he recalls sounding like the buzz of honeybees.“We realized how helpless they were … and we were also helpless (in) that we couldn’t do anything for them,” said Akhter, who is secretary general of the Bangladesh Garments & Industrial Workers Federation (BGIWF). He spoke via a translator in a group interview with CNN and other media outlets.Monday marks 10 years since history’s deadliest garment factory disaster. More than 1,100 people, mostly women, were killed. Over 2,500 others were injured. While businesses in the building’s lower floors had immediately closed when structural cracks were discovered a day earlier, thousands of factory workers were forced — either directly by their superiors, or indirectly by the pressure to earn a day’s wage — to return on the day of the collapse, despite many of them raising concerns.“The workers did not have any say because they were working for minimum wage … and they were not even unionized,” Akhter said. “So, they couldn’t collectively raise the issue (of not returning to work).”The collapse was triggered by vibrations from diesel generators switched on following a power outage. But subsequent investigations revealed a long catalog of failures, oversights and — according to organizations like the global nonprofit Transparency International — corruption at practically every stage of the seven-year-old building’s life.Rana Plaza collapsed because substandard materials were used to build on the site of a filled-in pond, and because extra floors were added to expand the structure beyond its authorized design. It collapsed because authorities had permitted the building, originally planned for commercial purposes, to be converted to industrial use and additionally occupied by five garment factories. It collapsed because earlier audits were inadequate; warnings were ignored or dismissed.In 2016, 38 people were charged with murder over the tragedy, including factory owners and government officials, though some of these individuals have since died or had their charges dropped. Rana Plaza’s owner, Sohel Rana, remains in custody as part of a lengthy ongoing trial. He has, in the meantime, been convicted on separate corruption charges.But the search for accountability went far beyond individuals — and stretched beyond Bangladesh’s borders. Factories in Rana Plaza produced garments for the likes of Italian retailer Bennetton and British fast fashion brand Primark. As such, the disaster held a mirror up to the developed world, namely consumers hungry for cheap clothing and Western brands using low-cost production to meet demand.In the collapse’s aftermath, numerous labels sourcing from Bangladesh vocally committed to improving worker safety in the country. So, a decade on, are the clothing factories that now account for 84% of the country’s exports any safer?The events of April 24, 2013 triggered swift — and yet, still belated — action from Bangladeshi authorities. Almost 20 garment factories were shuttered within two weeks of the disaster. But it was clear, as it had been before the collapse, that safety issues were endemic. Six months earlier, a major fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory outside Dhaka had claimed at least 117 lives; seven years before that, in 2005, the nine-story Spectrum factory had collapsed, killing 64 people.Fast-forward to today, and major garment factory disasters — of that scale, at least — have seemingly been avoided. This is often credited to a groundbreaking agreement reached between brands, factories and trade unions less than a month after Rana Plaza: the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.Signed at the time by over 200 brands, and applicable to any Bangladeshi factory or workshop supplying them with garments, the legally binding commitment established an independent inspection program spanning fire, electrical and building safety. Inspection findings are made publicly available. So too are improvement plans for underperforming factories, with corrective action implemented using funds committed by participating brands. The Accord has also introduced safety committees and complaint mechanisms via which workers can raise concerns — anonymously if they so wish.Such are its successes that a Pakistani version of the Accord was announced last year and has been signed by 49 brands and retailers, including Zara’s parent company Inditex.This is not to say Bangladesh’s garment industry has been incident-free. The International Labor Organization reported that, between Rana Plaza’s collapse and 2018, at least 35 further accidents in clothing factories had resulted in 27 deaths. Among them was a boiler explosion that killed 10 in 2017. (The Accord’s inspection process was expanded to include boiler monitoring shortly after).To date, however, over 30,000 factory inspections have taken place under the agreement, with over 400 facilities completing what organizers call “initial remediation.” In 2021, the New York Times reported almost 200 factories with poor safety standards had lost contracts following Accord investigations.Christie Miedema of the Clean Clothes Campaign, a Netherlands-based nonprofit that served as one of the Accord’s signatories, cites real “success stories” in recent years.“We know of very clear examples where an actual collapse has been prevented because a factory owner didn’t want to evacuate, but the Accord ordered them to do so until things were repaired,” she said on a video call. “We also know of examples where workers complained about safety … and were dismissed, then the Accord stepped in and said ‘No, you have to re-hire them because they can’t be retaliated against for (raising) safety issues.”“It’s very difficult to quantify how many lives the Accord has saved, because you can never know,” she added. “But it is definitely thousands.”The Accord is not without its shortcomings. For one, the relative absence of North American labels among signatories was conspicuous, with many seemingly concerned about financial commitments and the risk that legally binding commitments might lead to costly lawsuits. While there were a handful of exceptions — such as PVH Corp., the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein — the likes of Wal-Mart, Gap, Target and Macy’s did not join.These brands, and others, instead formed their own group called the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. It, too, organized inspections and safety initiatives at hundreds of Bangladeshi factories in its members’ supply chains. And while the Alliance was criticized for being less rigorous and binding than the Accord, it has claimed its own successes. Before concluding its five-year tenure, as planned, in 2018, the organization reported that 93% of faults identified were corrected, while 178 facilities were removed from its list of compliant factories. (Many of the members went on to form Nirapon, an organization that continues to work in Bangladesh to carry out what it calls “the next phase” of the Alliance’s safety programs.)Even putting aside the differences between these two rival initiatives, the absence of a collective response among Western brands was counterproductive, Miedema said, adding: “There could have been a united best standard… (but the split) weakened the unity of the sector in responding to this tragedy.”What’s more, the two agreements still only covered around half of the country’s thousands of garment factories. Many small manufacturers and subcontractors continued to operate outside their remits — as have factories used by Chinese and Korean brands, which were barely part of the conversation in 2013, according to Miedema.Initially lasting five years, the Accord was renewed in 2018 and then for another two years in 2021. Nazma Akter, a former child worker who founded the labor rights organization Awaj Foundation, called on more US companies to participate.“Any brand that doesn’t sign the Accord does not respect the workers and does not believe in freedom of association,” she said, adding: “Without mandatory human rights due diligence, there is no accountability, no transparency and no penalty or punishment for brands like (those using factories in) Rana Plaza.”Groups like the Clean Clothes Campaign are not only urging brands to renew the agreement again later this year, but to expand their commitments to cover wages, union rights and worker welfare, ranging from menstrual health to tacking gender-based violence. For Miedema, addressing these issues is as intrinsic to worker safety as structural or electrical complaints.“We’ve seen progress in one very specific area that’s very much connected to what happened at Rana Plaza — building safety — but not in these other areas,” she added. “If (Rana Plaza’s) workers had a union, they might have resisted entering together. If they had wages that sustained them, then maybe the threat of losing a month’s wages …. wouldn’t have sounded so terrible.”In 2013, amid the wave of protests and strikes immediately following the disaster, Bangladesh’s government raised the minimum salary for garment workers from 3,000 to 5,300 taka (then $68) a month. Five years later, this sum rose again to 8,000 taka (then $95), though the global union IndustriALL is currently demanding a figure three times higher, saying that “roaring inflation” has left Bangladesh’s factory workers “struggling to make ends meet.”And while wages have crept up since the disaster, they have been vastly outpaced by the growth of the garment industry. Clothing exports from Bangladesh, which is aspiring to become a middle-income country by 2031, jumped from $14.6 billion in 2011 to $33.1 billion in 2019, according to consultancy McKinsey.Akter, who began working in garment factories in the 1990s when she was just 11 years old, echoed the calls to look beyond the strictest definitions of worker safety.“Our members now feel very empowered and confident when safety issues come about,” she said, reflecting on the improvements since the Rana Plaza collapse. “But we are fighting not only on safety issues — we are trying to establish that the Accord should look after working conditions and (tackle issues like) gender-based violence … It’s about empowering and ensuring workers’ voices and union rights.”Top image caption: Workers take part in the rescue operation at the site of the Rana Plaza building collapse in Savar, near Dakar, Bangladesh, on April 25, 2013.This article was updated to reflect the latest number of signatories for the Pakistan Accord.",sport,0.0
242,256,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/milan-design-week-2023/index.html,"Craft, salvage and sustainability take center stage at Milan Design Week","09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","The design world’s largest annual fair enjoyed a return to full pre-pandemic form with its 2023 showcase, transforming the city of Milan with hundreds of exhibitions, site-specific installations, pop-ups and public projects.‘Fuorisalone,’ the network of city-wide events that runs alongside the main trade show offered a series of compelling new ideas from the creative realm, from home furnishings to socially-driven projects. Shows took place in traditional gallery and showroom settings, grand palazzi not usually open to the public and also in private apartments and even an abandoned abattoir. Almost everywhere, the focus was on sustainable design, circular economy, material innovation and artistry combining craft with innovation.Countering the rise of artificial intelligence in the art and design world, a number of creatives turned their attention to artisanship and traditional craft – albeit often integrating new technologies and 3D printing in their works.At “Tools & Crafts” a show held at non-profit space Fondazione Riccardo Catella, UK-based textile studio Woven Memories presented hand-woven cushions that incorporated digital coding into the design to fuse text with pattern and create “pieces of memory;” while Lebanese-Armenian designer Nareg Krikorian displayed handmade leather stools featuring exaggerated stitching and details to  honor Armenian craftsmanship.A vast former slaughterhouse provided the venue for this year’s Alcova (an itinerant and independent exhibition that changes venue every year) where Italian wallpaper company Fabscarte and artist Martyn Thompson wrapped an entire room in a moon-inspired, three-dimensional wallcovering handcrafted using copper and bronze powder. Nearby,Within the same space, Natalia Triantafylli and Andrew Scott of London-based designers N/A collaborated on a collection of objects incorporating 3D printed plastic, ceramic and sheet steel, with every single element, from bolts to hinges, made by hand – an effort to spotlight the uniqueness of handmade products and the importance of the maker’s touch in contemporary design.Also at Alcova, Korean designer Sangmin Oh debuted “The Knitted Light,” a series of sculptural lamps made with traditional fishing lines and elastic yarns that respond to light in different ways, exploring the possibilities of 3D knitting – just like the works of Dutch collective Basketclub, which showcased a series of experimental, woven 3D objects aimed at bridging the physical act of braiding with unconventional materials.Craftsmanship also shone at events organized by big fashion brands  — many of who are now regular fixtures alongside the event’s more established architecture and design names.Tod’s invited British fashion photographer Tim Walker to showcase the artistry behind some of the label’s most iconic items – from the Di Bag to the Gommino loafer – with an exhibition at the stately Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci. Loewe displayed a collection of chairs constructed by the house’s skilled craftspeople at Palazzo Isimbardi; Hermes presented an edit of mid-century-inspired furniture pieces that included mouth-blown table lamps designed by Finnish designer Harri Koskinen, hand-embroidered carpets and upholstered wooden chairs.At Bottega Veneta, Italian design legend Gaetano Pesce was tasked with designing two hand-crafted handbags, which were displayed as part of an installation called “Vieni a Vedere” (Come and See) inside the brand’s flagship store. Individually painted with an airbrush technique, each tote featured the house’s signature Intrecciato weave showing two mountains with a sunrise or a sunset behind – a nod to the mountains of Este, where Pesce spent his childhood, and the prairies of America, where he lives today.Engaging colors and textures were as predominant as artisanship during the week   perhaps another nod to the fact that, despite increasingly digital lifestyles, we are still very much yearning for real-life experiences.At Alcova, Greek designer Kiki Goti reimagined the dressing room as a space for personal transformation with the maximalist series “Neo-Vanity,” which featured a pendant light, a side table, a modular mirror, and a standing vanity in vivid colors, Balkan-inspired patterns and unexpected materials like foam.Design brand Chef Deco turned kettlebells, yoga carpets and meditation cushions into vibrant, multifunctional home objects, while at new exhibiting space Convey, Italian designer Marco Ripa and Swedish studio Stamuli leaned on ultraviolet fluorescent lighting rays and color-blocking respectively for their collections, displaying furnishings that felt pop, bold, and fun.Within the stunning location of Bagni Misteriosi, a 1930s lido and cultural center in the city’s Porta Romana neighborhood, Danish furniture company Gubi explored the possibilities of play with “TEN: Beyond the Beetle,” a show to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its iconic Beetle Chair. The brand asked 10 international artists and designers to reinterpret the classic seat through their own preferred medium, with a sound installation, an artwork, a ceramic vase and a deconstructed version of the Beetle made with recycled fabrics among the results.Elsewhere, French brand Roche Bobois presented the sculpture-like sofa “Bombom” by Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos, which featured pastel layered hues and backrests that rotate to allow people to sit in different directions; the young Croatian designer Ana Koruga debuted “Objects for Movement” – a series of eight home items with purposely unstable bases aimed to engage users in active, more physically-aware living.Sustainability was a common theme at this year’s fair, and it showed across the work of younger designers and household names. Some of the most interesting ideas were those that looked at waste – literally – to rethink what design can do when it uses what is already there.At “Tools & Crafts,” Dutch designer Kick Veldman invited people to look at their reflections in the trash they have produced by creating mirrors made from waste aluminum, while at exhibition space Dropcity, Japanese designer Daisuke Yamamoto presented a furniture collection made entirely of lightweight gauge steel, a commonly used and disposed of building material.More discarded materials shone at Alcova, where Taiwanese creative Erco Lai displayed ceramic 3D printed pieces next to homewares made with material waste collected from factories in The Hague, where he’s based.Similarly, Californian PROWL Studio and M4 Factory, which specializes in regenerative plastic goods, tackled the issue of fast furniture with the PEEL Chair, a reimagining of the ubiquitous plastic stacking chair made from hemp bast fiber – a byproduct of hemp and cannabis industrial processing that typically goes to waste. Shown in various stages of decomposition, the chair challenged viewers to approach products with the end of their lifecycle in mind.Top image: One of two bags design legend Gaetano Pesce created for Bottega Veneta’s Milan Design Week installation.",style,0.0

We are delighted too that its first use will be to guide Their Majesties into Westminster Abbey at the Coronation Service.”The cross will officially be received by the Church in Wales at a service following the coronation, and it will be shared between the nation’s Anglican and Catholic churches, the statement said.Representing the Roman Catholic Church, Mark O’Toole, the Archbishop of Cardiff and Bishop of Menevia, said his church accepted the cross “with a sense of deep joy,” adding that it is a sign of the nation’s “deep Christian roots.”.The Cross of Wales was designed by master silversmith Michael Lloyd and made with Welsh materials: recycled silver from the Royal Mint in Llantrisant; Welsh slate for the stand; and Welsh windfall wood for the shaft.Charles also participated in its creation, hammering the hallmark onto the silver cross himself.Tim Knox, director of the Royal Collection, the British monarchy’s private art collection, described the cross as “inspired by medieval Welsh art and design,” combining historical reference with contemporary craft.The back of the cross is adorned with words from the last sermon of St. David, the patron saint of Wales, in Welsh: “Byddwch lawen. Cadwch y ffydd. Gwnewch y pethau bychain,” translating to: “Be joyful. Keep the faith. Do the little things.”",style,0.0

But rather than being composed of the French painter’s Impressionist brushstrokes, the monumental recreation is made from the studs of Lego bricks — a whopping 650,000 of them in 22 different colors.Titled “Water Lilies #1” the nearly 50-foot-wide piece is the largest Lego artwork Ai has ever made, according to the museum.His version depicts the idyllic lily ponds of Monet’s home in Giverny but includes, on the far right-hand side, a “dark portal” alluding to Ai’s childhood in China’s Xinjiang region. The patch of dark Legos represents the door to an underground dugout where the artist lived with his father in exile during the 1960s, according to a museum press release.“In ‘Water Lilies #1’ I integrate Monet’s Impressionist painting, reminiscent of Zenism in the East, and concrete experiences of my father and me into a digitized and pixelated language,” Ai said in a statement. “Toy bricks as the material, with their qualities of solidity and potential for deconstruction, reflect the attributes of language in our rapidly developing era where human consciousness is constantly dividing.”Ai has used a range of materials in his installations and conceptual artworks, from pottery, wood and porcelain to film, photography and found objects. In the late 2000s, the artist and activist added Lego bricks to his repertoire.These colorful, meticulous works include hundreds of portraits of political prisoners and exiles, created by Ai for a 2014 exhibition. The following year, the artist made headlines when Lego refused his studio’s request for bulk orders of the bricks for a new project, a move he described as “censorship” (The Danish company later reversed its decision).During the controversy, Ai’s fans and members of the public sent him their own Lego blocks, and these donated bricks will also be displayed at his new London show in an installation called “Untitled (Lego Incident).”The exhibition, “Ai Weiwei: Making Sense,” will include other installations created on a colossal scale, including 200,000 porcelain spouts from Song dynasty-era teapots and thousands of fragments of Ai’s own sculptures that were destroyed when his Beijing studio was demolished by the city’s authorities in 2018.The scale of Ai’s installations are “unsettling and moving,” said the museum’s chief curator Justin McGuirk in a statement. “And in trying to make sense of these works the visitor is challenged to think about what we value and what we destroy.”On “Water Lillies #1” McGuirk said: “On the one hand (Ai Weiwei) has personalized it by inserting the door of his desert childhood home, and on the other he has depersonalized it by using an industrial language of modular Lego blocks.

Moscow has denied the allegations.“To mark the anniversary of the war, we decided to launch a commemorative banknote which will depict on a small piece of paper a year of emotions, patterns, content and iconic things,” Andriy Pyshnyi, governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, said during a presentation at the central bank in Kyiv.The central bank has worked hard since the invasion on February 24 last year to keep the economy afloat and maintain stability.Last summer, it pegged the hryvnia at 36.57 to the dollar, and it has intervened regularly on the foreign exchange market to support the currency.Thanks to billions of dollars in foreign aid from Western partners, Ukraine’s hard currency reserves have grown to nearly $30 billion, slightly higher than at the start of the war.Ukraine has also imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions.Pyshnyi said the new note, which contains innovative security features, will have a circulation of 300,000.Central bank officials said it took about eight months to design and produce the note, and the bank plans a series of commemorative notes to provide a visual record of the war.They said they were already planning new notes to commemorate victory and Ukraine’s reconstruction.“During this year, Ukrainians have realized their force, their significance, their ability not only to withstand but also to win, to win without forgiving a single military crime, a single ruined house,” Pyshnyi said. “This victory will be at a very high price but it will happen and it will be ours.”",world,0.0
246,263,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/playboy-the-conversation/index.html,How Playboy cut ties with Hugh Hefner to create a post-MeToo brand,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Hugh Hefner launched Playboy Magazine 70 years ago this year. The first issue included a nude photograph of Marilyn Monroe, which he had purchased and published without her knowledge or consent.Hefner went on to build the Playboy brand off the backs of the countless women featured in its pages, whose beauty and performance of heightened feminine sexuality have entertained its readers for generations.Approaching its 70th anniversary in December, Playboy has radically shifted. With the magazine no longer in publication, the Playboy Mansion sold to a developer and London’s last remaining Playboy Club closing in 2021, what is the future for Playboy? The brand is changing to keep up with the post-#MeToo world.Hefner passed away one month before allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017 giving momentum to the #MeToo movement (which saw survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak out against their abusers).READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship … with AI? Why human-machine relationships could go mainstreamIn recent years, many have re-evaluated Hefner’s legacy and relationships with women. The 2022 docuseries “The Secrets of Playboy” (which aired on Channel 4 in the UK) detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Hefner from several ex-girlfriends, including model Sondra Theodore and TV personality Holly Madison.Hefner and Playboy’s relationship with women has been complicated. Playboy was an early supporter of abortion rights, helped fund the first rape kit and was at times an early proponent of inclusivity (for example featuring transgender model, Caroline “Tula” Cossey, in its June 1981 issue). But most women featured in Playboy have fit within a narrow beauty standard — thin, white, able-bodied and blonde.Meanwhile Hefner’s personal relationship with his much younger girlfriends reportedly followed patterns of control and emotional abuse. Ex-girlfriend Holly Madison described Hefner as treating her “like a glorified pet” in her 2015 memoir, “Down the Rabbit Hole.”Hefner’s passing meant he evaded reckoning with the #MeToo movement. Playboy, however, responded, releasing a statement in which it affirmed support for the women featured in “The Secrets of Playboy” and called Hefner’s actions “abhorrent.”The statement declared that the brand was no longer affiliated with the Hefner family and would be focusing on aspects of the company’s legacy that align with values of sex positivity and free expression.READ MORE: The ‘milf’: a brief cultural history, from Mrs Robinson to Stifler’s momToday, Playboy is a very different company from the one Hefner launched nearly 70 years ago. Roughly 80% of Playboy staff identify as women, according the company, and its motto has changed from “Entertainment for Men” to “Pleasure for All.” Shares in the company are publicly traded and 40% of its board and management are women.The company has also moved towards more creator-led content through its app, Playboy Centerfold. Similar to subscription content service OnlyFans, Playboy Centerfold allows subscribers to view content from and interact with its creators, which it call “bunnies.”On the app, creators — or bunnies — are able portray their own bodies however they wish, putting the power back in their hands. Perhaps Playboy’s future is no longer in serving the male gaze, but instead the very audience Hefner dismissed in his first letter from the editor:“If you’re a man between the ages of 18 and 80 Playboy is meant for you … If you’re somebody’s sister, wife or mother-in-law and picked us up by mistake, please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to your Ladies Home Companion.”The stars of Playboy’s mid-2000s reality series, Holly Madison and Bridget Marquardt, are also enjoying a resurgence among fans.“The Girls Next Door” launched in 2004. The show focused on the lives of Hefner’s three girlfriends, Madison, Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson. It became E’s best performing show and cultivated a new female audience for Playboy.“The Girls Next Door” was a story of complicated empowerment despite patriarchal interference. Its three female protagonists went from being known solely as some of Hefner’s many blonde girlfriends, to celebrities in their own right.They each ultimately broke up with Hefner, leaving the Mansion and going on to lead successful careers.The show’s depiction of Madison, Marquardt and Wilkinson as empowered, fun-loving and complex individuals, who found joy and agency through expressing their sexuality was perhaps what drew so many female fans to the show. However, amid the girls’ fight for agency, Hefner retaliated.The series shows that he maintained final say in every Playboy photograph of the girls, as well as imposing strict curfews and spending allowances.In Madison and Wilkinson’s memoirs, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” and “Sliding into Home,” they claim that production consistently undermined them. They refused to pay them for the first season, didn’t credit them until season four and aired their uncensored nude bodies in foreign broadcasts and DVD releases without consent.READ MORE: #MeToo in space: We must address the potential for sexual harassment and assault away from EarthFan interest in “The Girls Next Door” remains strong. In August 2022 Madison and Marquardt launched their podcast “Girls Next Level,” where they interview previous playmates and interact with fans. They also recap episodes from their own points of view, unpacking their experiences of working on the show.Having reached 10 million downloads as of February 2023, the success of the podcast — 14 years after the last episode of “The Girls Next Door” — speaks to the cultural legacy of the Playboy brand. It also shows that despite Hefner’s original editor’s note, Playboy resonates with some women.Playboy is now in a post-Hefner era, where the imagery of women found within old issues of Playboy can serve as inspiration for others to enjoy their own sexuality. Whatever the future has for the company, the concept of Playboy has become public property — be that in the appearance of Playboy bunny costumes each Halloween, the popularity of cheeky Playboy logo tattoos or branded lingerie and clothing.In a post-#MeToo era, the women of Playboy are speaking up and taking over. With the mansion gates closed, the bunnies are finally reclaiming the brand as their own.Top Image: Hugh Hefner with Playboy “bunnies” in London in 1966.",style,0.0
247,266,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/history-of-butts-heather-radke-culture-queue/index.html,A juicy new book explores the cultural history of the backside,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","In the introduction to her book “Butts: A Backstory,” journalist Heather Radke recalls a moment when, at 10 years old, she and a friend were cat-called by two teenage boys while out riding their bikes.“‘Nice butts!’ we heard them say,” Radke writes. “The fact that they said something unprompted about our butts felt uncomfortable and bizarre… I was aware that there were body parts that were considered beautiful and sexy and were coveted by others, but it had not occurred to me that the butt was one of them.”That episode was just one a series that led Radke to realize how big of a role backsides play not just in our relationships with our bodies, but in the cultural, social and gender-specific experiences that define womanhood.“Butts, silly as they may often seem, are tremendously complex symbols, fraught with significance and nuance, laden with humor and sex, shame and history,” she writes. “The shape and size of a woman’s butt has long been a perceived indicator of her very nature — her morality, her femininity and even her humanity.”It’s from these observations that “Butts” — a thoroughly researched cultural history of the female butt — stems.Weaving together memoir, science, history and cultural criticism, the book addresses the physiological origins of our behinds and takes readers from the cinched waists of the Victorian era all the way to Kim Kardashian’s Internet-breaking backside and the popularization of the Brazilian butt lift. In between, Radke examines the role of eugenics, fashion, fitness fads and pop culture in defining the racial and misogynistic standards surrounding the butt.“I only know what it’s like to be a White woman with a big butt, which obviously has its limitations,” Radke said in a phone interview. “It was important to me to challenge our ideas about where bodies come from by listening to different voices.”“Since the rise of the transatlantic slave trade, there’s always been a kind of racial undermeaning in any conversation around the butt, as well as gendered approaches to questions like ‘What is a feminine body? What is a beautiful body? And how feminine can a beautiful body be?’” she continued. “The answers to those questions have oscillated through time, but our deep preoccupation with this specific body part reveals how the butt has long been used as a means to impart control, prescribe desire, and install racial hierarchies.”A recurring figure in “Butts” is Saartjie “Sarah” Baartman — the so-called Hottentot Venus (the term Hottentot, now widely regarded as offensive, was historically used to refer to the Khoekhoe, an indigenous tribe of South Africa). Baartman was an Indigenous Khoe woman forced to exhibit her “large butt” for White audiences in Cape Town, London and Paris in the 19th century.Radke’s account of Baartman’s life, and of how her body became “a fantasy of African hypersexuality,” underlies much of the book’s narrative, as she traces the stereotypes created by European “racial scientists” of that era and, later, the skewed and prejudiced legacy of big-butted women as more highly sexual – especially Black women – directly back to the exploited Baartman.Radke spoke with Janell Hobson, a professor of women’s, gender, and sexuality studies at the State University of New York at Albany who has written extensively on Baartman. Hobson links the fetishization of Baartman’s figure to the seeding of colonialism and the continuation of slavery into White society.“(Baartman’s) show perpetuated ideas around African savagery and primitive Black womanhood, ” Hobson explains in in the book. “So when white people were looking at Sarah Baartman, they were projecting all of this stuff they’d already inculcated in the culture.”“Baartman’s story is still with us in a lot of ways,” Radke said. Although she died in 1815, “her body was on display in Paris up until the 1980s, then again in the ’90s. That really isn’t that long ago, and tells you just how much we’ve turned her into something grotesque to gawk at — a stereotype and symbol of exploitation.”Radke later points to the bustle — an undergarment  popularized in the late 19th century designed to make a woman’s backside look enormous — as a glaring example of White appropriation of Baartman’s figure. “It was a way for Victorian women to look like Sarah Baartman, while at the same time asserting their own whiteness and privilege, as it could simply be taken off,” Radke said. “That behavior would be repeated again and again through history.”Shee explores that same butt-based cultural appropriation — and monetization — as exercised by celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Miley Cyrus, whose famous twerking routine at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and during concerts on her “Bangerz Tour” that same year (where she used a large prosthetic butt as part of her choreography) was, Radke writes, a prop to “‘play’ in Blackness.”Alongside addressing the visual culture of Black music videos, plastic surgery and the recent belfie (a portmanteau of butt and selfie) craze in the same vein, Radke also highlights periods in contemporary history where trends skewed in different, oppositional directions. She highlights the rise of “buttless women” in the 1910s — a look best represented by the sleek look of the flapper — through the invention of sizing and the 90s brand of “heroin chic” captured by the supermodel Kate Moss. Such an aesthetic is “something that’s never really gone away,” Radke noted.“I didn’t aspire to write an encyclopedia of the butt, but rather give a historical context to the way it has been perceived and portrayed, and how women’s feelings around it have shifted alongside it,” Radke explained. “Whether consciously or not, we, and society at large, have always been paying attention to our butts — hiding them, accentuating them, fetishizing them. Which is kind of funny, when you think it’s actually a body part we cannot see ourselves unless we’re in front of a mirror.” As she writes in her book, “the butt belongs to the viewer more than the viewed.”While many of the stories exposed in “Butts” are steeped in physical suffering — diets, restricting shapewear, surgical scalpels — there’s also joy to be found.To counter the extreme workout regimes of the 80s, like the “Buns of Steel” fitness craze that equated a sculpted butt to self-control and self-respect, Radke profiled the fat fitness movement that emerged during the same decade, which reimagined “what was possible for people who often felt excluded from mainstream fitness culture” to offer a form of resistance.In Astoria, Queens, she spent time with a group of drag queens who sculpt foam butt pads to embellish their backsides, turning the butt into something joyous and judgment-free.“A history of bodies — especially female bodies — is always going to be a history of control and oppression, but I felt it was important to also show the other possibility: liberation,” Radke said. “Those stories were some of the most fun research I did, and some of the most surprising, too, as they allowed me to meet people who have overcome societal prescriptions, and embraced a different way to think about bigness, which helped me reframe it, too.”Ultimately, Radke said, what’s perhaps most compelling about the butt is that it doesn’t have to mean anything.“Butts have the power to make us feel so miserable or angry, especially when we’re in a dressing room trying on a pair of jeans that just won’t fit,” she noted. “But that angst is the result of centuries of history, culture and politics. It doesn’t come from our bodies, it has been placed on them. If we take a step back, we’ll see that butts are just a body part. They could mean nothing at all.”Read: “Ugliness, A Cultural History” (2015)Author and academic Gretchen E. Henderson delves into the meaning of ugliness, tracing its hold on our cultural imagination and examining how we’ve always been attracted to it. With analysis stretching from from ancient Roman feasts to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and acrossart, music and Uglydolls, the book casts an unflinching gaze at the ways ugliness has shaped and challenged aesthetics and taste.Watch: “Braided: An American Hair Story” (2019)Charting the history of braids in the United States through slavery, Black entrepreneurship and, ultimately, its cultural appropriation by the mainstream, this Elle magazine-produced documentary looks at the influence and legacy of the hair styles in American culture.Read: “The Power of Style: How Fashion and Beauty Are Being Used to Reclaim Cultures” (2021)As an Indigenous (Ojibwe) member of the Nipissing First Nation reservation in northern Ontario, Christian Allaire didn’t see his culture reflected in any media or pop culture growing up.

248,272,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/greg-girard-tokyo-jal-76-88/index.html,Vintage photos show underbelly of boom-era Japan,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","When celebrated photographer Greg Girard landed in Tokyo in April 1976, he expected to spend only a few days in the Japanese capital. At that time a “broke traveler” in his early 20s, he was headed to more affordable destinations in southeast Asia.He left his luggage at Haneda Airport and, with nowhere to sleep, spent his first night in Tokyo roaming the streets of the city’s lively Shinjuku district, camera in hand.“I was just floored by the way everything looked, because it was never presented in the West, this modern city,” Girard recalled in a video interview, noting that his arrival was long before movies like “Blade Runner” and ’90s pop culture exposed mainstream Western audiences to Asian metropolises.“I ended up deciding, pretty much on that first night, that I was going to stay,” he said.What began as a whim became a four-year stint, which saw Girard teaching English by day and photographing Tokyo by night. He rented an apartment and, nearby, a small darkroom where he would develop his pictures.He didn’t know it then, but these images captured the boom years before Japan’s infamous economic bubble burst in the 1990s. With the yen soaring, a sharp increase in market speculation would eventually lead to financial crisis. But before then, Girard said, there was a palpable sense of emerging affluence — one woven through his images of consumer electronics, office towers and bustling intersections.“This was the time of Japan’s rise, before the rest of the world was really aware of what was happening,” said the Canadian photographer, who published a selection of his vintage photos in the new book “JAL 76 88,” adding: “It was a period of real optimism and a dynamic kind of growth of Japan as a place that was starting to become treated as an equal (to the West).”During his nocturnal wanderings, Girard became fascinated not only by the Japan’s rapidly ascendent economy but by what unfolded there after hours. Many of the book’s images hint at the country’s darker underbelly: Posters of nude women, entrances to seedy nightclubs and empty hotel rooms that leave viewers wondering what might have unfolded in them.“There was this division between the practicality of running ‘Japan Inc’ — making sure people get to bed early — and the release mechanism of staying out all night if you wanted to,” the photographer said. “Both of those things were going on at the same time.“The trains would stop at midnight, so there was a whole subculture around what to do between the last train stopping and the first one beginning (the next morning),” he continued. “There were game arcades and all-night coffee shops where people parked themselves in front of an expensive coffee and no one bothered you for sleeping in a booth all night — that’s kind of what they were there for.”Girard’s once-futuristic images ooze vibrant greens, pinks and blues, colors saturated by his use of long exposure settings. The photographer allowed light to flood into his lens and illuminate what lay in the shadows. Often using a tripod to steady his shots, he focused on where the light fell, not where it originated from, painting Japan’s cities basking in a neon glow rather than emitting one.“It felt right to move away from the cliche of neon signs,” he said, “and to see where the light was landing, whether it was on people, buildings, cars, puddles or whatever it might be.”The title of Girard’s new book, “JAL 76 88,” combines Japan Airlines’ callsign with the years between which the photos were taken (he also included images from assignments that took him to Japan in the late 1980s, after he had relocated to Hong Kong). Dozens of daytime pictures also feature, as does a selection of black and white photos. Girard would often carry two cameras – one with monochrome film and the other color – at the same time.But for all the vibrancy captured in the photos, some of his most compelling images are void of human activity, whether deserted construction sites or empty passageways floodlit by streetlamps. As he familiarized himself with Tokyo, Girard used photography as an excuse to explore quieter areas he might not otherwise have visited.“The alleys and streets just off the entertainment districts, or the ordinary neighborhoods – they had a life of their own, too,” he said. “I went wandering, just looking down alleys around the waterfront, before it became a popular part of the city. Whatever place you live in, making pictures is a way to make it your own.”Girard’s experiences also helped honed his camera skills, laying the groundwork for a successful photography career. Experimenting with long exposures and different types of film was something he “consciously started to explore and get good at technically” in those years, he said, adding: “So it was that learning process as well.”In the decades since leaving Japan, he has shot for magazines including National Geographic and TIME while publishing books on a number of Asian cities, including Hanoi, Okinawa and Shanghai. He is perhaps best-known for his images of the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City, an almost entirely lawless, mob-controlled enclave in Hong Kong that once housed some 50,000 residents in just 6.4 acres.Looking back, Girard says his photos of Japan serve as a kind of diary of his youth. But despite spending his nights on the town, he always maintained a certain distance from the nightlife he documented. His focus was always on photography itself.“I didn’t go to bars to drink or to party — in those days, anyway,” he said. “I was doing almost anything and everything just to make pictures.”“JAL 76 88,” published by Kominek Books, is available now.",style,0.0
249,273,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-egypt-river-nile/index.html,Two strangers met on the River Nile. They’ve been married for 25 years,2023-05-05 09:43:00,"Christina Ward had only known Wahid Kandil for six months when he asked her to marry him.The couple were sitting on a bench overlooking the River Nile one evening, the ancient Temple of Luxor illuminated behind them.Wahid turned to Christina. “So, are we getting married or what?” he asked.Christina almost laughed. The question was somehow both out of nowhere and long-awaited.Since meeting as colleagues on a Nile tour boat, Christina, from the UK, and Wahid, from Egypt, had spent every moment they could together.“To be able to say I fell in love while sailing down the Nile under the moon and stars sounds very romantic but that’s exactly what happened,” Christina tells CNN Travel today.Christina had arrived in Egypt in October 1996, spurred on by her self-described “itchy feet.” She was 28 and desperate to see the world, so the six month stint as an Egypt-based tour guide for an adventure travel company seemed like the perfect opportunity. She’d essentially be paid to travel. Plus, she loved Egypt and was fascinated by the country’s ancient history.As tour leader, Christina was responsible for shepherding groups of 25 travelers on two-week-long trips around the country.“We’d visit Luxor, Aswan, Hurghada and Cairo and do lots of side trips like riding donkeys at sunrise to the Valley of the Kings, riding camels into abandoned monasteries in the desert, dinner at Nubian family homes,” recalls Christina.Part of each trip took place on what Christina calls “the backpackers boat of the Nile.”This was the Kimo, a small tour boat home to a series of bunk bed-filled cabins, where Christina and her charges would sleep while on board, as well as a dining room and a sundeck, where raucous parties would take place as the boat sailed down the river.On her first night in Egypt, Christina introduced herself to the Kimo’s crew. She wanted to establish a good rapport with her new colleagues. She was especially keen to meet the boat’s manager, 26-year-old Wahid Kandil, as they’d be working closely together. As manager, it was Wahid’s job to ensure everything on board ran smoothly – which often it didn’t – as well as look after the crew, provisions, budget and help Christina ensure the tourists had a good time.Cairo-born Wahid had previously put a degree in horticulture to use as an agriculture engineer on a large farm in the desert, but he found working on the tour boat way more fun. Wahid enjoyed meeting people from across the world – and he still embraced his love of gardening when he took tourists on side trips to the islands dotted down the Nile, teaching them about local plant species.On her second evening in Egypt, Christina found herself sitting next to Wahid outside one of the Kimo’s cabins. The two smoked together and “had a bit of a flirt” as Chirstina puts it.She liked Wahid right away, and later that evening scribbled a line or two about him in her diary.Wahid liked Christina too, but he was wary. In his time working on the Kimo, he’d noticed a trend – young women would turn up from the UK to temporarily work in Egypt tourism and enjoy a brief fling with a local. He felt like they were looking for Egyptian boyfriends more for the sake of novelty than anything else, so he usually steered well clear of boat romances.“I always kind of rejected that,” he says today.But as the days rolled on, Wahid and Christina gravitated towards one another. Sure, they were both busy with the tours – and there was no privacy on the Kimo, so there was “no deep conversation,” as Wahid puts it. But they stole every chance they could to chat and flirt.From day one, Christina loved working as a tour guide. She enjoyed traveling around Egypt, but she especially loved the days spent on board the Kimo.“Sailing on the Nile is magical,” she says.One evening, Christina dropped her tour group off for dinner on land in the Egyptian city of Aswan. Then she popped back onto the boat to see if she could catch Wahid. She spotted him, wandered over to say hello, and asked what he was doing later.“I didn’t mean anything by it,” Christina says today.“Yes you did,” says Wahid, laughing.“Well, maybe I was flirting a bit,” admits Christina.Wahid said he was around that evening, and so he and Christina arranged to meet up at a nearby hotel bar. But then Christina was summoned back to her tour guide duties, and she ended up being 45 minutes late to the date. She had no way of contacting Wahid to let him know, as neither had cell phones. So, after finishing up work, headed to the hotel as fast as she could.“When I walked in, he had a face like absolute thunder,” says Christina.Wahid was standing by reception, writing a note for his would-be date, which he intended to leave with the staff.“It was quite an angry note,” Wahid says, recalling that he’d written: “Nobody’s ever stood me up like this.”But when Christina explained her tardiness was out of her hands, Wahid relented. The two went inside together and found a table on the bar terrace. They were at the Old Cataract Hotel, a five-star establishment on the banks of the river, famous for being the spot where English crime writer Agatha Christie wrote her detective novel “Death on the Nile.”“It was a really beautiful terrace – very romantic, looking over the Nile,” says Christina. “It was just amazing.”“But very expensive,” adds Wahid. He didn’t tell Christina at the time, but the cost of their multiple drinks and snacks ate up a significant proportion of his monthly salary.Still, at that moment, he didn’t care. He was just happy to spend time with Christina – especially because their conversation that night moved beyond the boat-based, flirtatious back and forth to something deeper.“That was the first time that we really talked about a wide range of things,” says Wahid.They discussed their thoughts on family, faith and their life goals.“I think it clicked that we really get along very, very well,” says Wahid.“It was a late night,” says Christina.The next day, the two were back to work on the Kimo and the glow of the night before slightly faded when they had a bit of a workplace “power struggle,” as Christina puts it.Wahid planned an unscheduled boat stop and Christina questioned the logistics of the decision – she was worried the tour was running late.“I’m standing there going, ‘You can’t do this!’ So we ended up having a little bit of a power tussle, which is quite funny,” she recalls.It was a little heated, but still light-hearted. It was obvious that, even when they were arguing, Christina and Wahid enjoyed each other’s company.Still, neither of them thought that the burgeoning relationship would go anywhere.From Christina’s point of view, her time in Egypt had an end date and therefore so did her relationship with Wahid. After working in Egypt, she planned to spend six months as a tour guide in Turkey.“I thought, ‘This is just my first trip. This is just six months in Egypt, and I’m going on somewhere else afterwards, so this is just a temporary thing,’” says Christina.As for Wahid, he had other pressures weighing on his mind. Shortly before Christina came into his life, Wahid’s mother had been diagnosed with cancer. This news had upturned his world, leading him to question every part of his life.“My mum obviously was a very part important of my life,” he says. “I was quite torn at that time. It was very rough.”When he first learned of his mother’s illness, Wahid was in a new relationship. While he knew it didn’t make sense, he’d come to associate this girlfriend with his mother’s diagnosis, and subsequently ended things between them.“It’s a superstition, if you will — she’d brought this plague into my life, I thought she was bad news, so I kind of ignored her, ghosted her, and that was it,” he says. “And then Christina came, and I fell for her.”At first, Wahid didn’t tell Christina about this very recent ex-girlfriend. But of course Christina eventually found out, and she felt misled and angry.When this news leaked, the couple happened to be on board another ship on the Nile. The Kimo had unexpectedly broken down, and so the adventure travel company had chartered some cabins on a large, luxurious cruise ship.Feeling hurt and betrayed, Christina ignored Wahid for the rest of the day and focused her attention on the cruise ship’s manager, with the aim of making Wahid jealous. She succeeded, with Wahid panicking he’d lost Christina forever.As they argued over what had happened, both Christina and Wahid recognized for the first time that their feelings for one another ran deep. Their respective jealous reactions spoke volumes – this wasn’t just a fling. This was real.“That was probably the catalyst and the turning point,” says Christina.From there, both Christina and Wahid decided: “This is serious, and we’re going to take this further.”That’s how the couple came to be sitting by the Nile in Luxor, talking about the prospect of marriage.By then, Christina was certain she and Wahid would share a future. But there were a lot of unknowns in this equation. Where would they live? What would their families think? Should they wait a bit longer before jumping into commitment?“I didn’t say yes, didn’t say no – I ummed and ahhed what to do,” says Christina.She questioned whether she should go back to the UK for a while, to “logically remove myself and see if this is the right thing to do.”But when it came to it, Christina couldn’t bring herself to go back.“I just knew I couldn’t leave Egypt without him,” she says.Christina was with a tour group in Cairo when she made the decision. It had been a long, stressful day, and she found herself wishing that Wahid was there by her side.“I am ‘Miss Independent’ and I’m strong, and I can stand up for myself. But every now and again, I want someone to stand up for me,” she says.“And so I just walked across to this payphone, picked it up, called him and I said, ‘Right, what date are we getting married?’ And we literally planned it a week after that tour finished.”Getting married, says Wahid, was a promise that “this is the person you want to spend your life with.”For both Christina and Wahid, marriage was the start of a new chapter. They decided they wouldn’t live in Egypt, and they wouldn’t live in England either – they’d start afresh, somewhere new.“We both wanted to start a new life somewhere together,” says Christina. “We just knew we wanted to do it together.”Wahid’s family were encouraging, telling him he had to do what was right for him – although one of his sisters did voice some concerns.Meanwhile, Christina called her mother back in the UK. “You need to come to Egypt to visit,” she said. “There’s someone I want you to meet.”When Christina’s mother met Wahid, she knew right away.“You’re going to marry him, aren’t you?” she said on the first evening of her trip, tearing up.“She very much had the attitude that East and West – it’s not going to work,” says Christina. “I was angry and upset at first, and then she was stuck on a boat with us for two whole days. That was interesting. But she came around a bit, for sure.”Wahid jokes he “bribed her” by cooking up some great food.“Looking back on it, you do realize it’s all coming from a place of love and concern, that’s all,” says Christina.“I don’t think it was a nasty resistance,” agrees Wahid.Perhaps more worrying was the reaction Christina received from the British Embassy in Egypt. She recalls contacting them to discuss visas and being immediately counseled against marrying Wahid, with officials saying he was likely using her to get a British passport.But Christina and Wahid ignored these naysayers and a wedding date was set: April 26, 1997.They planned to keep the celebrations “small and simple,” but it ended up being a “very big party,” as Wahid puts it.Christina’s parents and sister flew over from the UK, and Christina’s mother and sister took her shopping for a wedding dress in Cairo.Wahid’s family gathered for the occasion, and the crew of the Kimo all turned up. Christina’s fellow tour guides coordinated their respective tours to end in Cairo so they could attend too – although this meant a bunch of the tourists coming along as well.“There were probably about 50 people we’d never met at our wedding reception,” says Christina, laughing.“All dancing, all partying,” recalls Wahid.The couple didn’t mind, it only added to the celebratory atmosphere.“It was a really good party,” says Christina.“It’s not customary for most Egyptians to have alcohol at weddings,” says Wahid. “However my friends had two bottles of whiskey in one of their cars so we kept popping out to have discreet shots and run back into the reception.”After the wedding, Christina took Wahid’s last name, becoming Christina Kandil, and the couple traveled to the port city of Alexandria for their honeymoon.Christina and Wahid set their sights on relocating to Canada together, but the paperwork took longer than they anticipated. In the meantime, the couple settled in Christina’s hometown of Portsmouth, on the south coast of England.Not long after they arrived, they threw a big party for Christina’s friends who hadn’t made it to Egypt for the wedding. They were thrilled to meet Wahid – they’d heard a lot about him in Christina’s gushing letters over the previous six months.But Wahid struggled with life in England. He spoke good English, but wasn’t fluent and felt self-conscious about his accent when communicating with strangers.He also worried about his mother, who was still undergoing treatment for cancer. He’d call home regularly to ask his father and brother for updates.Around nine months after moving to England, Wahid and Christina returned to Egypt to visit Wahid’s family and friends. When Wahid’s father picked them up at the airport, he had some shocking, sobering news: Wahid’s mother had passed away a few months previously.Wahid couldn’t believe it. Christina recalls that “his legs literally went out from under him.”“They were worried that, if he came, they thought it was going to ruin his residency for the UK or something, and they didn’t realize it wouldn’t be a problem. So they didn’t tell him,” she says.Wahid thinks the decision was less practical and more emotional – an act of protection more than anything else.“When you are far from your family, they don’t want you to get upset. They want to be there to protect you when you’re upset,” he says.Whatever the reason, the reality was Wahid moved to the UK and never saw his mother again.“I was so looking forward to seeing her,” he says.In July 1999, Wahid and Christina’s Canadian visas were finally approved and the couple relocated to Calgary. They were excited, although when they arrived to an unseasonal summer snowstorm, they initially panicked that they’d made the wrong decision.“But Canada ended up being really, really good for us,” says Christina. “It was fantastic living there, we built a house there and had the kids.”The couple lived in Canada for nine years, first in Calgary and then Edmonton, welcoming two children, Yasmine and Tariq.Christina’s mother would come and visit often. Despite her initial reservations, she was happy for Christina and Wahid.“She would never tell him – but she absolutely loved him,” says Christina. “She’s passed away now, sadly, but she absolutely thought he was a diamond.”In Canada, Christina worked for an accountancy company while Wahid rose up the ranks at an agricultural consulting company. They were pretty settled, but Wahid felt like he was never quite where he wanted to be professionally. He had periods of depression which Christina tried to help him through.“I was always the one saying, ‘We have a house, we have a car. We have two wonderful children. It’s enough, it’s okay,’” she recalls.Then, in the mid-noughties, Wahid was approached to start a company in Dubai. After some more twists and turns, he and Christina eventually invested all their savings into this company. And, following a rocky start, the business took off.Today, Wahid and Christina still live in Dubai, which they say works well as a “middle ground” for their two cultures.“You’ve got the Muslim side of things, so when you’re doing Ramadan, you’re surrounded by everyone who’s doing it. But we’re also so Westernized here as well,” says Christina.Wahid is from a Muslim family and Christina was brought up Christian. Before their children were born, the couple decided they would bring them up in the Muslim faith, but still celebrate the Christian holidays of Easter and Christmas. They were conscious that as a multifaith, international couple, it was important to be on the same page about their kids’ religion from the outset.But something Christina and Wahid didn’t anticipate was what it would be like for their kids to be what’s called “Third Culture Kids” – children who grow up in one country, with parents from two different countries altogether. It was only when Yasmine and Tariq became teenagers that their parents realized this was a lived experience they’d never really be able to relate to.“It’s not easy when you don’t have roots,” says Wahid. “I grew up in Egypt, she grew up in England, and we still have some roots, even if you leave them. But for Third Culture Kids, they don’t know who they are and I think they struggled with that a little bit when they were young.”In more recent years, Yasmine, who is now 22, and Tariq, who is 19, have been forming and embracing their own cultural identities, learning more about their families and their dual heritage.Yasmine, who is passionate about cinema, recently put together a short film about Wahid’s mother, the grandmother she never knew. In the film, she imagined what it would be like to go back in time to meet her. For Christina and Wahid, watching this play out on screen was incredibly moving.“We’re sitting in the cinema, we’re watching it, crying our eyes out,” says Christina. “It’s such a nice legacy to have on that story.”Yasmine’s film ambitions also include one day making a movie about her parents’ love story. Wahid and Christina might be biased, but they reckon it could make a pretty good film.After all, as Wahid says, it “was a roller coaster, there were a lot of twists and turns – but I love it, I think it’s meant to be that way.”“I love it too,” says Christina. “We’ve been through a lot, but he’s my rock. I’d like to think I’m his rock too.”“You are,” says Wahid.“If one of us is down the other one pulls the other one through – it’s a partnership,” says Christina.It’s now over 25 years since Christina and Wahid fell in love as twentysomethings on the River Nile. The couple are both in their 50s, but Wahid insists they’re “still a bit young at heart.”“We still have a lot of fun, and go dancing and drinking. I feel like we’re still the same age almost – which is a bit silly, but I don’t think we’ve changed a lot.”“We like each other’s company,” says Christina. She says they love to “sit in the garden, have a few drinks, play cards together – we don’t need lots of people.”Today, the couple see their unlikely meeting as the basis for the mantra they’ve carried through their shared life: “Everything happens for a reason.”“We are such strong believers in that, because of how it all started for us,” says Christina. “Looking back on it now, we were both on that path to each other before we even knew it.”“There were so many reasons for this not to happen,” says Wahid. “But against all odds, it did.”",travel,0.0
250,274,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/destinus-hypersonic-plane/index.html,Frankfurt to Dubai in 90 minutes? Europe enters the hypersonic plane race,2023-05-04 02:54:00,"It’s now been two decades since the era of supersonic commercial flight ended with Concorde’s final touchdown in an airfield in southwest England.In recent years, numerous pretenders to the throne – supersonic, hypersonic, hydrogen-powered, with anti-boom technology – have been whizzing round, conceptually at least, but many of these projects promising seamless super-fast travel have instead stalled, sputtered out or hit delays.Now a European hypersonic startup is having a go, promising enticing journey times such as Frankfurt to Sydney in 4 hours 15, or Memphis to Dubai in 3 hours 30.The Destinus concept is hydrogen-powered flight at five times the speed of sound, cutting flight duration to less than a quarter of current commercial air travel.Headquartered in Switzerland with a team of around 120 staff spread out in Spain, France and Germany, Destinus was established in 2021 but has been hitting milestones fast. Its first two prototypes have made successful test flights and are about to start testing hydrogen-powered flight. Its third prototype – Destinus 3 – is set to make its inaugural flight by the end of the year.Martina Löfqvist, the company’s business development manager, caught up with CNN over video call to explain its model and why the team hopes it can be the one to finally usher in the new age of hypersonic travel.“There are different approaches to doing this,” says Löfqvist. While other top contenders in the field such as Boom Supersonic are “focusing more on the development of the mockups and understanding of how it works and trying to get these piloted aircraft working, we’re going directly to autonomous flights.” The strategy is to “develop smaller-size drones before we scale it up to become a large pilot-driven or passenger-carrying aircraft.”Hydrogen is the Destinus fuel of choice due to it being a clean, renewable energy source, increasingly inexpensive to produce, and capable of helping it realize its speed and long-range ambitions. Hydrogen-powered aviation is still in its infancy, with hydrogen jet engines yet to enter commercial use. Airbus is developing a hydrogen jet engine it says will begin flight testing in 2026.“We try to go very, very ultra-long range with our vehicles,” says Löfqvist, “and that is to fly from Europe all the way to Australia at Mach 5. Using kerosene means that the vehicle would become quite heavy, while hydrogen is very light in comparison.” Hydrogen also has higher energy density than traditional jet fuel.The long-term goal is to fully hydrogen-powered and zero emissions, but while hydrogen production is still scaling up, its short-term plan is to power takeoff with Jet A – conventional aviation fuel – and then switch when they hit speeds of around Mach 3 “because hydrogen doesn’t really become useful or better than Jet A until you get up to supersonic speeds.”The Destinus prototypes are blended-body planes in the waverider shape — a hypersonic design first conceived in the 1950s but never yet reaching production — with the company’s Swiss/French origins being reflected in paintwork inspired by the Alps.The now classic shape has “been studied for many, many, many years,” says Löfqvist. “The purpose of it is so that you can ride on top of the shock waves that are generated from the vehicle itself. It’s a pretty efficient shape where you can use less fuel to fly through it because you have less resistance with the air.”Naturally, with every new prototype Destinus is refining and adjusting the design. Two decades from now, the team expects the crafts it’s working with to look a little different from the models it’s testing now.The upcoming prototype, Destinus 3, will be supersonic and the hope is for it to achieve supersonic hydrogen-powered flight in 2024. “This is a pretty massive vehicle,” says Löfqvist. “It’s about the same size as the previous prototype in terms of being around 10 meters (long), but it’s 10 times heavier, and probably 20 times more complex as well, in terms of the structure and in terms of the propulsion system.”The hoped-for timeline is that by the 2030s the company will be able to launch a smaller-scale aircraft, holding around 25 passengers, which will have some limitation in terms of range and be fully focused on business class customers.By the 2040s, its fully scaled-up version will have multiple classes, including economy. They’re hoping that by then “hydrogen prices will drop significantly, so that we can then reduce the prices of the flights, significantly as well, for these ultra-long-range flights.”The company’s plans are quite dependent on the vagaries of the hydrogen market, which Löfqvist freely admits it’s not in control of, but experts inside and outside of the company have advised that they estimate prices to drop.Last month Destinus acquired Dutch company OPRA, now named Destinus Energy. Says Löfqvist, “This means that we can have revenues already this year, because they already have gas turbines that are built and being sold. We’ll have now not just that hypersonic airplane aerospace side, but we’ll also have some of these energy aspects within the company as well.”In addition to the private investment and public funding it already obtained – in April 2023 it secured grants worth 26.7 million euros ($29.4 million) from the Spanish government to expand its hydrogen propulsion capabilities – Destinus hopes this additional revenue will help it weather the challenges that have seen other supersonic and hypersonic projects fall to the wayside. Löfqvist emphasizes that the company is aiming for a “realistic” approach “now that the funding environment is a bit tougher.”Nevada-based Aerion, which was a major contender in the race to be the first to build a supersonic passenger jet, collapsed in May 2021, declaring that “in the current financial environment, it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements.”As for whether we’ll be hopping on hypersonic jets by the 2040s, breakfasting in Shanghai and hitting Sao Paulo just after lunch, there may be a few technological, environmental and financial hurdles to overcome before then. But it won’t be want for trying.",travel,0.0

But the undisputed champ of African hiking is that big country at the bottom end of the continent – South Africa.One of the country’s greatest strengths is sheer volume. The global hiking app AllTrails lists more than 3,700 trekking trails and routes in South Africa compared to other top African trekking destinations: Kenya (20 trails), Tanzania (21), Namibia (33) and Morocco (18).South Africa also offers incredible variety when it comes to terrain and climate: trails that range from coastal, mountain and desert to the country’s unique fynbos landscapes, which offer Mediterranean-like vegetation with extremely high biodiversity.Trails in South Africa tend to be well-maintained and well-marked. Many of them boast overnight hiker huts. While it’s certainly possible to hire a guide, most of them are DIY – easy to hike on your own with equipment that can be rented or purchased at outdoor outfitters in Cape Town, Johannesburg and other big cities.Last but not least is the fauna factor. While animals exist on every South Africa trail, those that pose the biggest threat to humans on foot (lion, elephant, rhino, buffalo, leopard) are largely confined to places where you should never hike without a guide — namely game reserves and wildlife-oriented national parks.Here are nine of South Africa’s best multiday backpacking trails:South Africa’s oldest (established in 1968) and most celebrated hiking route, the Otter Trail runs along the Eastern Cape coast between Storms River Mouth and Nature’s Valley in Garden Route National Park.The terrain varies from sandy strands and rocky shoreline to dense maritime forest and flower-filled fynbos vegetation with its iconic proteas. Birdlife is profuse and there’s a chance of spotting sea lions, dolphins, blue duiker antelope, hyrax and the cape clawless otters that give the trail its name.Four overnight camps with huts, toilets, showers and braai (barbecue) areas are spaced along the trail. To preserve the integrity (and serenity) of the trail, only 12 hiking permits are available each day.Distance: About 45 kilometers (27 miles)Time: 5 daysInfo: www.sanparks.org/parks/garden_route/Summit the legendary Drakensberg escarpment on a vertiginous route that rises high above Thendele Royal Natal National Park in KwaZulu-Natal province.The hike isn’t long in terms of miles, but at times it’s literally straight up via chain ladders. The relatively flat summit – which lies at around 3,200 meters (10,700 feet) – is shared by South Africa and Lesotho.Hikers who spend at least two nights at the summit have time to hike along the escarpment to jaw-dropping views of the Amphitheatre and Tugela Falls, which plunges a world-record 983 meters (3,225 feet).Even on warm, sunny days at the bottom, hikes should be prepared for rain and thick mist at the summit, and even snow during the southern hemisphere winter. No more than 50 hikers per day are allowed to camp overnight.Distance: 45 kilometers (27 miles)Time: 2-3 daysInfo: royalnatal.infoAugrabies Falls National Park in the Northern Cape provides a dramatic desert setting for an under-the-radar route that starts near the biggest waterfall along the Orange River and meanders along the crest of its deep gorge.Only opening between April and October when temperatures are at their mildest, the trail is hot and dry throughout the year. Hikers should carry plenty of water, sunscreen and head protection.Hikers sleep in huts with bunk beds, toilets, cooking areas and potable water. The trail is limited to 12 hikers per day. Reptiles and birds are the most commonly spotted wildlife, but the national park also safeguards giraffes, zebras, leopards and a variety of antelopes including its namesake klipspringer.Distance: 39.5 kilometers (25 miles)Time: 3 daysInfo: sanparks.org/parks/augrabies/The fabled Cape of Good Hope provides a historical and highly scenic setting for a rugged loop trail with awesome ocean views and rich fynbos vegetation.Starting from the Cape of Good Hope National Park entrance gate, the trail hops across mountains overlooking False Bay to Cape Point and features three overnight huts with bunk beds, showers, toilets, solar power and cooking areas. Day two takes the hike up the Atlantic shore and across the Cape Peninsula with a grand finale atop Rooihoogte peak.The area’s biodiversity is unparalleled among temperate regions, with more than 1,080 plant species and 250 bird varieties, as well as ostriches, zebras, caracal cats and eight kinds of antelopes.Distance: 33.8 kilometers (21 miles)Time: 2 daysInfo: sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/The best overnight hike within a short drive of Johannesburg, the Summit Trail roves the rugged highlands of Kgaswane Mountain Reserve in the Magaliesberg Range.The trail is accessed from several points including the park entrance near Rustenburg and the park visitor center. Hikers can crash at a primitive campground near the summit or in one of several mountain huts.Humans and their evolutionary kinfolk have been hunting, gathering and hiking in the Magaliesberg for more than two million years, reflected in the fact that Kgaswane is part of a biosphere reserve that includes the Cradle of Mankind World Heritage Site.Distance: About 25 kilometers (16 miles)Time: 2 daysInfo: hikingsouthafrica.co.za/kgaswane-summit-trail/The lush inland mountains of Garden Route National Park provide a primal setting for a route that features prehistoric fern trees and cool rock pools, river crossings where the water is often waist-high and bright green highlands reminiscent of Scotland.And it starts with the paradise beach at Nature’s Valley, near the first of five overnight huts tucked into the pristine indigenous forest or on lofty ridges with cooling breezes and panoramic views.Hikers can top or tail the trek with other nearby adventure activities like bungee jumping, treetop canopy course, whitewater rafting or tubing and sea kayaking.Distance: 62 kilometers (39 miles)Time: 6 daysInfo: mtotrails.com/location/garden%20route/5/tsitsikammaA hiking experience rather than a fixed trail, the Rim of Africa is a guided trek stretching through the mountains and valleys of the Western Cape from the remote Cederberg range north of Cape Town to the Outeniqua range near George.Led by veteran hikers, the route is divided into nine traverses which hikers tackle one at a time over a period of years rather than an epic nonstop through-hike. Each traverse takes seven to 10 days during the South African spring (September-November).Much of the route runs through classic fynbos vegetation and nearly all of the trek is considered strenuous, with many steep grades.

252,276,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-camino-de-santiago/index.html,Two strangers met walking the Camino de Santiago. Just weeks later they were engaged,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","When Loni Philbrick-Linzmeyer decided to walk the Camino de Santiago, she was adamant this was something she had to do alone.It was 2013. Loni was a 29-year-old Californian school teacher who was “at a crossroads.” She’d just endured a tough break-up and was feeling adrift.“It really spun me into questioning my own values and my own future – whether I wanted kids, what was my path for that?” Loni tells CNN Travel today. “Workwise, I was also in kind of a rough spot, I had a really tough year of teaching.”As she tried to escape these feelings by socializing and keeping busy, at the back of her mind, Loni knew what she really needed was time to pause and reflect. She was a “bit fearful” of what would happen if she just left things rolling on, unchanging. Would she end up stuck? Even more unhappy?One night, tossing and turning and unable to sleep, Loni decided, definitively, that she was going to take action. Some late night Googling led her to discover the Camino de Santiago, the famous pilgrimage trail that spans some 500 miles (800 kilometers) across France, Portugal and Spain. The historical pilgrimage’s multiple routes conclude in the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela, at its spectacular cathedral.Loni booked a plane ticket to Paris there and then.“It was very spontaneous, very random, but also at a moment in time where I just knew I had to do something else to really shake up the habits that I had – and give a lot of reflection time to my life and where I wanted to go and who I wanted to be,” says Loni. “So that’s how I came to the Camino.”Over the next two months, Loni trained and prepared for the adventure. Her loved ones were supportive, albeit a little concerned about Loni embarking on the trip alone. But Loni was adamant this needed to be an independent adventure, so her parents bought a large map of the Camino route and hung it in their house to map Loni’s progress with sticky dots as she updated them on her movements.Across the Atlantic in Denmark, 24-year-old Kjartan Bergqvist was halfway through medical school and questioning his decision to become a doctor. Was it the right path?An ex-girlfriend had once mentioned the Camino de Santiago – before then, Kjartan had never heard of it – but during late night study sessions when he should have been poring over medical textbooks, Kjartan found himself thinking about the Camino. In the end, his decision to embark on the trek was even more spontaneous than Loni’s.“I went into Copenhagen, bought some hiking boots and a bag and basically left the next day on the train to Paris,” says Kjartan.Like Loni, Kjartan felt strongly that this needed to be a solo trip – so much so, that he didn’t even mention the Camino to any friends or family. He told his parents he was planning to travel around Europe, but kept specifics vague.Loni and Kjartan set off from Paris within days of each other, each soon finding solace in life on Camino.There was something comforting – and exciting – about waking up each day and walking solidly. There was endless time for reflecting and thinking things through alone. There was also plenty of opportunity for connection with fellow hikers.“It’s very open on the Camino,” says Loni. “It can be as independent or as social as you want or need on the day.”Sometimes Loni would walk with other travelers for a little while. Other times she’d stay solo for long stretches, but enjoy greeting friendly faces along the route. Fellow walkers were instantly recognizable, with their backpacks and hiking boots.“Sometimes you have extended conversations with people, regarding all different kinds of topics, sometimes it’s really deep emotional stuff. Other times, it’s more superficial,” says Kjartan.Whenever Kjartan or Loni would cross paths with fellow pilgrims – as Camino walkers are often called – they’d offer the same warm greeting: “Buen Camino.”“It’s such a good phrase, because it means hello and farewell at the same time,” says Kjartan.It was around two weeks into their respective trips that Kjartan and Loni first met. They were in a forested area, not far from the Spanish city of Burgos.“Buen Camino,” they said to one another as their eyes met. Then Loni commented on the weather – there were some clouds in the distance, and she was excited by the prospect of rain. She lived in California, she explained, where it never rained.“I’m Kjartan,” said Kjartan. “I’m from Copenhagen, Denmark.” It rained a lot there, Kjartan said, so as far as he was concerned, a rainy day in Spain wasn’t too appealing.The interaction was friendly, but brief – and neither of them suggested they walk on together, so Kjartan continued on ahead.As he walked off, a surprising thought crossed Loni’s mind: “I can move to Copenhagen for that guy.”“It was weird, it wasn’t love at first sight,” says Loni today. “I think I ended up forgetting his name later – but certainly there was a moment of, ‘Okay, maybe I’m kind of interested here.’”As Kjartan strode on ahead, he found himself hoping he’d cross paths with Loni again.And sure enough, that evening the two strangers ended up in the same Burgos inn, which was filled with other Camino walkers.“Typically in the evening, people kind of gather, maybe have some wine and some chat and then hit the bed early, to be ready the next day to continue walking,” says Kjartan.When Kjartan spotted Loni walk in, he was thrilled.“I ran straight over,” he says.“That’s when I forgot his name,” says Loni, laughing. “But it is a bit hard for Americans to say Kjartan.”The two talked a little bit that night, but most of the conversation was in a group setting, as fellow Camino walkers shared stories with one another and compared blisters.At one point Loni mentioned that she was planning to take the following day as a rest day and explore Burgos. Kjartan hadn’t been intending to linger, but he figured maybe he’d do the same, in the hope another opportunity to spend time with Loni might arise.“I just went to bed that night really wanting to talk to you the next morning,” Kjartan tells Loni today.He was so excited by the prospect that he barely slept. The next morning, he “jumped out of bed and ran downstairs.”There was Loni, preparing to head out and explore the city.“Do you want to get a cup of coffee?” Kjartan asked her.“Sure, sounds great,” said Loni.She was pleased, but also a little surprised.“Honestly, I mean, it was a bit unexpected – there were not any other situations on the Camino where someone asked to get a cup of coffee with me,” says Loni today.As a result, the invite took on a formality that it wouldn’t have done back home. It kind of felt like a date. But it was just coffee. Maybe Kjartan was just being friendly? Or he just really liked coffee?“When we sat down and started talking, I had to maybe tease apart what your intentions were – if it was because you were interested in me or you just wanted a cup of coffee,” Loni says to Kjartan today.“But actually, once we started talking, very quickly the conversation flowed really easily.”Loni and Kjartan were just settling into a flow when they were interrupted by a Canadian Camino walker, Liz, who recognized them from the evening before – and didn’t quite pick up on the romantic vibes.“She had a sore knee and couldn’t walk that day,” explains Kjartan. “So she actually joined us, and we ended up a little group of three – and we just hung out in the city, because it’s a beautiful place.”The group spent the day soaking up Burgos, strolling the streets, popping into a museum. In the evening, they went out for sangria and Liz retired early, leaving Kjartan and Loni to pick up where they’d left off in the morning.By then, there was no question there was something between them. It was an amazing evening, but the next day Loni woke up feeling conflicted.“I had this super strong reaction where I just thought, ‘I didn’t come here to have a fling. I didn’t come all this way to meet some guy and hang out for two weeks,’” she says.Loni voiced her concerns to Kjartan, who understood where she was coming from.“I had been very conscious about not wanting to join a group up until that point,” he says. “But I also remember a shift, meeting Loni.”The two decided to spend the next day apart, but reunite in the evening and talk about how to proceed.In the meantime, Loni confided in her new friend Liz, talking through her concerns. She surprised herself with her conclusion.“I actually realized that the most vulnerable thing that I could do – and probably this was the growth that I was most searching for – would be to open myself up to actually walking with someone else,” she says.“So what I thought I had gone to do as a very independent thing ended up needing actually to be more open, more vulnerable, more exposing.”When Loni and Kjartan regrouped, he jumped in first – saying he thought they should walk the rest of the Camino independently – he wanted to respect Loni’s feelings and original intentions. But Loni interrupted. She’d had a change of heart, she explained.“You know what? I actually want to walk with you,” she said.And so Loni and Kjartan set off from Burgos together, with Liz rounding out the group.Both Loni and Kjartan were glad Liz was there too – she was funny and good-natured, great at keeping things fun and light. And she quickly became a great friend to both Loni and Kjartan.Every day, the two would wake up and check in with each other – did they still want to walk together?“Most days for the rest of the Camino, the answer was yes. And we walked together. And there were some days where we said, ‘No, I need some time apart today.’ And we just agreed where we would meet up,” says Loni.The days rolled on, and Loni and Kjartan grew closer. They’d hike through stretches of Spanish countryside, sharing stories about their lives and how they felt about everything – from their hopes for the future to their views on marriage.Loni had also reached a conclusion to one of the questions that had been bothering her before the trip – she now knew she wanted children. And Kjartan told her early on that having a family was important to him too.Prior to Loni and Kjartan meeting, they’d both been focused on the ultimate goal of reaching Santiago. But somehow that goal didn’t seem as important anymore. They were more open to unexpected detours – like the time they spent a whole day and evening at a quirky, hammock-filled B&B, where chickens ran around at their feet and a donkey brayed in the background.“Santiago didn’t really matter anymore,” says Kjartan.“Something had switched,” agrees Loni. “The realization that actually it’s the journey and it’s those moments along the way that you don’t anticipate that actually made it really memorable.”Time on the Camino also seemed to operate at a different frequency to time in the “real world.”“Those three weeks felt a lot longer, in a good way, a very good way,” says Kjartan. “I was just flying so high – obviously very much in love, and it’s summer, and there’s no place you have to be other than where you are at the moment.”But as they approached Santiago, Loni and Kjartan were overtaken with excitement, an urge to see the finish line.Liz wanted to walk a little slower, so on their final day, Loni and Kjartan hiked as a twosome, trekking some 31 miles (50 kilometers) and arriving into Santiago in the middle of the night.It was surreal, seeing the Cathedral at last, illuminated only by moonlight. All the hotels were closed, so the two slept on the street, sharing a single sleeping bag.“I realized that I did not want this to end, I didn’t want to go home without having Loni in my life,” says Kjartan.Loni felt the same way. And swapping contact details and promising to stay in touch didn’t seem enough. Even committing to a long distance romance felt lacking.“I don’t want to go home without you,” Kjartan told Loni, the day after they’d arrived in Santiago.“Me neither,” said Loni.“It’s settled then,” said Kjartan.“What do you mean?” asked Loni.“Do you really need me to ask you?” asked Kjartan.“Yes, I do,” said Loni.So Kjartan said the words aloud: “Will you marry me?”Loni was overjoyed.“In my secret desires, I’d wanted it,” she says of the proposal. “I think I was excited and, you know, a little nervous, but also, I don’t remember having any doubt that it was the right choice and that we would be able to do it. It was just clear as day – this is the path.”The day before, Loni had FaceTimed her mom and introduced her to Kjartan for the first time. Now, she texted her excitedly, “I’m engaged!”She decided to wait and tell her friends once she was back in the US. As for Kjartan, he sent his parents a postcard filling them in, “saying I was engaged and very excited, but they had to wait for the story until I came home.”Loni found herself returning to the thought she’d had when she first saw Kjartan – she would move to Copenhagen for him. It wasn’t just a romantic notion, there was a practical element to this decision: Kjartan was still in medical school, but as a teacher it would be easier for Loni to work anywhere.Then it was time for Loni and Kjartan to, temporarily, go their separate ways. Saying farewell wasn’t easy. But they departed excited and confident in their shared future.“I really believe that we decided not to spend the energy deciding whether we should be together, but pour that energy into figuring out how to be together in the best way possible,” says Loni.“Making that active decision on both ends helped us survive the whole going home, back into our own lives,” says Kjartan. “We were very determined and made an active decision to be together, and that was the most important thing.”Saying goodbye to one another was sad, but saying farewell to life on the Camino was almost harder. Loni and Kjartan had loved the simplicity of waking up each day, walking with a goal. They’d loved the community too. It was hard to leave it behind.Loni says she returned to California determined to “hold onto the Camino and the spirit of the Camino.”“When I left the Camino, I felt so at peace, just a sense of peace in myself,” she says.In early 2014, six months after they first met, Loni and Kjartan got married in a courthouse in San Diego, California. They kept their nuptials small, planning a larger celebration for that summer. But Liz flew in from her home in Canada to surprise them, and it seemed only right she acted as one of their witnesses. Loni took Kjartan’s name, becoming Loni Bergqvist.The subsequent summer wedding was a weekend of celebrations, and was also the first time many of Loni and Kjartan’s friends and family met. By the end of the weekend, they were a tight, multinational family.Liz officiated the proceedings, sharing the story of how she’d unintentionally interrupted Loni and Kjartan’s first date, and then had a front row seat as their relationship unfurled on the Camino. Loni and Kjartan wrote their own vows, and read them to one another.It was still a little while until the couple lived in the same country – before she got a job in Denmark, Loni got a job in London. But eventually, in 2015, Loni moved to Copenhagen, and in with Kjartan. The couple gave birth to their first child not long after.Today, Loni and Kjartan are still in Denmark, where they’re enjoying bringing up their three bilingual children. Kjartan recently quit medicine and is now studying theology, while Loni has her own education consultancy business.For both Loni and Kjartan, building their own family has brought them joy and fulfillment. Loni says it’s amazing to see their kids, “become these awesome little people with their own strong personalities and way of meeting the world.”The couple still strive to keep “the spirit of the Camino” alive in their day to day lives. But as time goes on, Loni and Kjartan find themselves reflecting less on the origins of their love story, and more on what happened next, and where they are today.“I feel like it’s not hard to go to Spain and fall in love – but it’s really taking the decision to commit and do the work that it takes, that’s what I’m really proud of,” says Kjartan.“There’s a reality to falling in love and taking a decision to get married,” agrees Loni. “There’s also a reality of moving to a foreign place, without your family or friends or knowing anybody except for one person.”Loni loves living in Denmark, but she’s also had to acclimatize to cultural differences and adapt to living far away from loved ones. Kjartan says he’s always conscious of that, calling their relationship, “inherently asymmetric in certain aspects.”“Loni has left everything behind to be with me in Denmark. I have not sacrificed the same for Loni. I’m in my own country surrounded by my family and friends,” he says.Loni became acutely aware of the reality of living far from her home country when her parents unexpectedly passed away, her mother in 2016 from complications with lung cancer and her dad from a heart attack in 2021.“My parents loved to come visit in Denmark. My dad was learning Danish and would visit every three months after my mom died,” says Loni.Loni says she’s grateful for Kjartan’s continuing support as she comes to terms with the loss of her parents.“Being able to support a partner who is grieving has given us a deeper bond,” she says. “What you need in grief is a bit unexplainable, but Kjartan has been able to be there and pick up the pieces during two fairly traumatic deaths. I honestly don’t know what I would have done without him.”Loni and Kjartan are as confident in their future today as they were that day in Santiago, when they got engaged after knowing each for just 23 days.“There’s a saying on the Camino, and it’s ‘the Camino provides,’” says Loni. “That can be anything from – you have a twisted ankle and there’s help that comes, or there’s a situation in which you can’t see clearly and someone talks you through that and helps you see clarity.”Loni and Kjartan believe the Camino provided them with one another.“Kjartan and I both went thinking that we desired a certain thing and that we needed a certain thing. And I think what happened was that the Camino provided something else unexpected,” says Loni. It wasn’t what they expected, but it was absolutely what they needed.Kjartan thinks it was “divine timing.”Loni’s less sure about fate or destiny. But whatever it was, it “was certainly something very special.”",travel,0.0
253,277,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/what-it-was-like-to-be-a-concorde-pilot/index.html,What it was like to pilot the supersonic Concorde jet,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","On January 21, 1976 a teenage John Tye was among crowds of onlookers clinging to a chain link fence, cheering as the first commercial British Airways Concorde flight departed from London’s Heathrow airport.Tye was exhilarated, amazed and inspired as he saw this sleek, supersonic airplane of the future climb into the skies and make history.Little did Tye know some 20 years later, he’d be sitting in the Concorde flight deck for the first time, pinching himself that his teenage dream was coming true.Tye vividly recalls his first moments flying Concorde. Sure, he’d gone through extensive training, he’d practiced on the simulator – but this was the real deal. It was a feeling he could never have fully prepared for.Tye and his fellow training pilots were in Seville, Spain. It was a beautiful Thursday evening – “the sun was just setting, you could see a big ball of fire at the end of runway,” as Tye puts it.“We got in and started the engines, and to feel those four Rolls-Royce Olympus engines starting up and the airplane vibration for the very first time was just absolutely mind blowing,” Tye tells CNN Travel.Tye synchronized his watch with the training captain and the flight engineer. Then, they counted down and prepared for takeoff.“It’s ‘three, two, one – now,’ and I pushed all four throttles fully forward in my left hand and I was just shoved back into my seat – an experience I could never describe, the acceleration as you shot off down the runway,” he says.Then, the Concorde was in the air, building height.“That 20 minutes was the most incredible experience in my aviation career. It was just absolutely unbelievable,” says Tye.For nearly three decades before it retired in November 2003, Concorde aircraft sped through the skies above the Atlantic in just under three and a half hours, flying at twice the speed of sound.Most of us can only imagine what it was like to be on board – after all, these aircraft were small, with room for just 100 passengers per flight, and ticket prices were steep.If comparatively few people experienced what it was like to travel on Concorde, even fewer know the feeling of piloting the fastest passenger plane ever to enter commercial service.British Airways and Air France were the only two airlines who operated the aircraft. It’s said that during the aircraft’s 27 years of service, there were more qualified American astronauts than there were British Airways Concorde pilots.When Tye first piloted Concorde in the late 1990s, the airplane had been established for two decades. Peter Duffey was there at the very beginning, as one of the first British Airways pilots selected to trial the aircraft.“I was involved in the development – flying with the test pilots,” Duffey tells CNN Travel. “We flew to Australia and Canada, carrying a lot of passengers.”Duffey, who is now in his 90s, learned to fly as an Royal Air Force pilot during World War II. He later flew the de Havilland Comet, the first turbo jet engine aircraft, and one of its successors, the de Havilland Comet 4. When Concorde came calling, Duffey was an established British Airways training pilot on the Boeing 707.“We knew Concorde was coming, and most people felt intrigued and wanted to get onto the aircraft. So I put my name down for it,” he recalls.Duffey helped mastermind the first Concorde training scheme, and flew the aircraft until he retired in 1980.Also there at the beginning was pilot Jock Lowe, who shares a birthday with Concorde – he turned 25 the day Concorde first took to the skies in 1969.Lowe remembers watching the aircraft on television that day.“I thought to myself, ‘Yeah, that’s what I’ll do. I’ll go and fly Concorde – not really realizing what was involved,’” Lowe tells CNN Travel.Like Duffey, Lowe was one of the first British Airways pilots to test out supersonic flying at RAF Fairford, a military airbase in southwest England.“It was quite a shock because I walked around the hangar on a foggy February morning at RAF Fairford – and I’d never even seen the aeroplane for real before,” says Lowe.”An hour later, Lowe says he was “let loose” with the Concorde, and it felt “amazing.”“We went up to about 63,000 feet and started to throw the aeroplane around,” he recalls. Lowe says the feeling, an analogy often echoed in Concorde circles, was “like going from a bus to a Formula One sports car.”Lowe ended up on the first BA training course in 1976 and was still on the Concorde fleet when he retired in 2001, earning him the accolade of the longest-serving British Airways Concorde pilot.“I flew it for longer than anyone else, by quite a margin. But, because I had lots of office jobs as well, I didn’t do as many hours as some of them,” says Lowe, who also served as BA’s flight operations director.Richard Westray, who first piloted Concorde in 1998, echoes Lowe’s “bus to Ferrari” comparison. He says commanding a Concorde was unlike the feeling of flying any other aircraft.“Racing down the runway for the first time, accelerating to climb into the air was one of those experiences you never forget,” Westray tells CNN Travel. “The feeling of speed during acceleration phases was just tremendous. The plane performed like no subsonic plane could perform.”Once the Concorde was in the air, it would climb fast, “at 100 knots faster than an ordinary subsonic jet,” as former Concorde First Officer Tony Yule explains.“You would probably climb somewhere around 2,000-4,000 feet a minute, which is really very, very fast, until initially you hit 28,000 feet,” he tells CNN Travel.Concorde couldn’t fly supersonic over land, so after the initial ascent, it would operate subsonically – although the velocity was still “well over the speed of a 747,” as John Tye explains.When Concorde reached the Bristol Channel, an inlet to the west of London leading to the North Atlantic, pilots would give passengers a heads up and then the aircraft would break through the sound barrier.There was, says Tye, “no banging, no crashing, no rattling and rolling.”Yule describes the moment the Concorde hit Mach 1 as “rather like putting a hot knife through warm butter – it slips in just like that.”But the subsequent shock wave would create a tiny blip that would briefly impact the instruments.“The vertical speed indicators in the flight deck would do a little dance as the supersonic shockwave passed over their external sensors,” explains Tye.That, says Yule, is how you’d “know you’re supersonic.”Then the pilots would make an announcement to passengers. “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve just reached the speed of sound, Mach 1. Welcome to the world of supersonic flight.”“And then we’re up to twice the speed of sound and nearly 60,000 feet on the ‘edge of space,’” says Tye.Tye distinctly remembers that moment on his first-ever Concorde flight.“I saw that curvature of the Earth, and the black sky above us, leading to infinity,” he recalls.As for Lowe, he spent nearly three decades flying Concorde, but he says the feeling of “exhilaration” at the aircraft’s technological marvels never really faded.“The tension, the excitement of the first flights, of the first year, it gradually reduced, obviously, but it never lost its excitement,” says Lowe. “It was always exhilarating.”It was also, he says, always “fun.” The atmosphere on board was always electric.“Everybody that worked with it, from the hangar floor upwards, everybody had a great deal of pride in the aeroplane and getting it right,” says Lowe.The small pool of Concorde pilots also meant everyone knew everyone. Operating other aircraft, you’d rarely fly with the same team, but with Concorde, there were always familiar faces in the crew, says Tye.“There were only ever 134 BA Concorde pilots the whole time the airplane was in service, so it really was a day out with your mates every time you went to work,” he says.Around 20 minutes after take off, cabin crew would start serving the passengers. Many of them were frequent flyers, business people “commuting” back and forth across the Atlantic. The crew would recognize familiar faces and know their drink of choice by heart.After providing for the passengers, the crew would pop into the cockpit.“They came in with three mugs of tea for each of us – the captain on the left, me and the flight engineer sitting behind,” recalls Tye.So far, so standard. But there was a Concorde twist.“Also on the same tray were three pots of some of the finest caviar in the world with a mother of pearl spoon each to eat them with.”The Concorde’s supersonic status also afforded pilots a vantage point like no other.“By the time you’re at 60,000 feet, you could see a quarter of a million square miles,” says Lowe. “So you could actually see the things that you saw on maps – there they were, for real.”For Tye, it was also surreal to take off and land and see crowds of people lined up to watch. It would take him back to the day he stood at Heathrow, watching the first commercial Concorde flight take off.On one occasion, Tye remembers an American Airlines pilot who was cleared to line up and takeoff before Concorde asking if he could skip his place in line, so that he could watch Concorde depart instead.“To operate a Concorde out of Heathrow was just incredible, you could feel the eyes of the other passengers in the subsonic airliners around you at Heathrow watching you, you could feel the pilots of those other airliners watching you,” says Tye. “And here I was, taxiing Concorde out, towards runway 27R at Heathrow.”Before the flight deck was closed to travelers post-9/11, Concorde’s on board philosophy was “a very big private jet that was being shared by up to 100 passengers,” as Westray puts it. “So we had very much an open flight deck policy.”The majority of the passengers were business people, and the remaining 20% were the rich, famous and important. Westray recalls showing Sting the flight deck on more than one occasion. It was surreal, but mingling with celebrities was part and parcel of working on Concorde.“The very first big name I met – I walked out, opened the curtain into the cabin, and there was Elton John sitting there in the front row,” recalls Tye.Tye recalls being stunned by how bizarre the moment was: “I’d been to Wembley Stadium to see him with 100,000 other people in concert just a few weeks before.”Tye and John had a brief interaction but Tye can’t recall any of it. “I was too starstruck to be honest with you,” he admits.After that, Tye made a mental note to himself that, before heading out to greet passengers on future flights, he’d first check “if any of my other heroes were out there,” so he could be more prepared.This strategy served him well – he later met superstars Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney.As for Lowe, over his decades-spanning Concorde career he transported everyone from Muhammad Ali to Richard Nixon – “many people I would have never, ever, ever dreamed of meeting – pop stars, film stars, businessmen to royalty.”As well as scheduled flights, Concorde also flew charter flights for the VIPs.The main difference with these flights, says Lowe, was “there was obviously just a little bit more tension and pressure to make sure that the aeroplane left on time and arrived on time.”He recalls one occasion when he was flying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip from Canada back to the UK.“We had to slow down because the temperature in the upper atmosphere meant that we’d reached the limits,” explains Lowe.The Queen noticed, and asked Lowe what was going on – why was the aircraft slowing down?The interaction, says Lowe, was “quite fun.”“I was able to explain a little bit – that we weren’t slowed down much, and we’d still arrive on time.”Sure enough, they did.The Concorde story ended in November 2003, when the last commercial flight landed in a Bristol airfield.There were a number of factors leading to Concorde’s retirement in 2003.In 2000, a fatal Air France Concorde accident led to an investigation and various modifications to the aircraft.Westray suggests that while the plane had an otherwise glowing safety record, some passengers never regained confidence in Concorde.He remembers meeting a former Concorde frequent flyer at New York’s JFK airport not long after the crash. This passenger was checking onto a Boeing 747 flight instead.“He apologized to me and said, ‘I’ll never fly Concorde again,’” recalls Westray. “He said, ‘I’m frightened of it.’”Concorde was very reliant on these regular customers who crossed the Atlantic frequently for work. Westray and Lowe say several Concorde frequent flyers worked in the World Trade Center and were killed on 9/11. These terrorist attacks also impacted global confidence in air travel more generally.And by the early 21st century, Concorde was getting old, and there were significant costs involved in the aircraft’s upkeep.“I wasn’t surprised it was retired, they kept it going as long as possible,” says Duffey. “But the maintenance costs were very large.”“It was going to have to go sometime,” agrees Lowe. “I think it was a little premature, but it would have stopped when the banking crisis came along in 2008, because we’d have lost half our passengers.”Tye says his Concorde career came to an end without him realizing. In August 2000, he was about to take off at Heathrow when he got a call telling him to return Concorde to the gate because BA was grounding the aircraft.“What I didn’t know then was I wouldn’t ever get back on Concorde,” says Tye. “Because of that, I didn’t have any mementos. I didn’t have any significant souvenirs, and I was planning to carry on flying Concorde for the rest of my career.”While Concorde did return for a couple of years before its final goodbye, in the interim, Tye became a BA Airbus captain and never returned to supersonic flying.Concorde’s final flight was, for Tye, a “a very, very sad, emotional day.”“It was a very emotional period, a lot of tears were shed,” echoes Westray, recalling an “emotional farewell” from air traffic control on his final Concorde flight from New York in 2003.When Concorde ended, Westray was grateful he was still young, and could train on another big aircraft and continue his aviation career.But other Concorde employees were out of their jobs – particularly the flight engineers. When Concorde launched, this was a key aviation job, but by the early 21st century the role was becoming obsolete thanks to advances in technology.Lowe was among the Concorde pilots who retired when the plane was grounded.“It was a point of reflection,” says Lowe of this period. “I wasn’t totally sure that it would come back – even though I had absolute confidence in the aeroplane.”As for Tye, he carried on piloting British Airways aircraft until 2022. As the years went on and the numbers of still-serving former Concorde pilots dwindled, Tye was increasingly peppered with questions about his supersonic days.“You weren’t a celebrity, but you were known as a Concorde pilot,” he says.On flights, he’d regularly be quizzed by a younger co-pilot keen to know all about Tye’s time flying supersonic.Tye always enjoyed these trips down memory lane.“I’d be delighted to share my passion and privilege with them and tell them all about it – and I’d try and get it right and know when to shut up and not hog the limelight.”There were only ever two female Concorde pilots: British Airways’ Barbara Harmer, who passed away in 2011, and AirFrance’s Béatrice Vialle, who still works for the French airline.Tye knew Hammer and says she was “absolutely wonderful.”While aviation is still known for being a predominantly male, predominantly White industry, Tye says he’s heartened to see progress in the two decades since Concorde’s final flight.“We are definitely becoming more diverse,” he says.Almost two decades since Concorde’s final flight, the allure of supersonic flight hasn’t waned, with companies such as Boom Supersonic plotting plans for Concorde’s successor.The former Concorde pilots have mixed views on the likelihood of supersonic flight’s return.Lowe cites the roadblocks of “the cost of development, the cost of materials, the cost of fuel.”Tye reckons it’s “something that could definitely happen again,” but points out engines would need to be quieter and more fuel efficient.“We couldn’t have Concorde engines now, they’re far too noisy and use far too much fuel,” he says.Westray says it “could be a reality, but I think it’s a lot further away than people think.”But one thing he is confident about – there will always be forward-thinking aviation development happening somewhere, somehow.“Scientists and aviation enthusiasts never stop and they’ll always be people pushing to expand the envelope,” he says.Today, Tye says he’s just grateful to have had the opportunity to fulfill his teenage dream. Piloting Concorde was an incredible job and every morning, he’d wake up excited and thankful.“Most of the people in my street would be walking off to the station with their briefcases, and I’d be getting in my car to drive to the airport to fly Concorde to New York. So that was just a thrill and an excitement every day when I went to work.”",travel,0.0
254,278,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/santorini-volcano-kolumbo-scn/index.html,The classic Mediterranean vacation spot that sits over a live volcano,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Everywhere you look on Santorini, you’re reminded that you’re on a volcano. The lunar landscapes, the black and red beaches, the pebbles made of solidified lava. The Greek island’s transfixing beauty is a result of the area’s violent volcanic history.Santorini is of course famous for its breathtaking crescent-shaped caldera, half of which is submerged – making it the only sunken caldera in the world. It was created by one of the largest known eruptions around 3,600 years ago. The explosion was so powerful that it wrecked Santorini’s ancient city of Akrotiri and dealt a fatal blow to the seafaring Minoan civilization, which had settled on the island at the time.Today, Santorini – also known as Thira – is Greece’s foremost romantic playground with luxurious villas and resorts providing pampered getaways for A-listers and dreamlike settings for lavish weddings and photoshoots alike. The island’s steep volcanic cliffs, perched about 1,000 feet above sea level, create an impressive geological canvas with whitewashed houses balanced on the edge. No wonder it’s one of the most photographed locations on the planet.Every evening, the island comes to a grinding halt for Santorini’s world-famous sunsets. The blue and white domed village of Oia gets packed as the golden hour draws in. As the sun begins to set behind the caldera’s cliffs, the sky transforms into a vivid display of red, orange, and pink hues. Thousands gasp as the last rays disappear in the sea.Few realize that beneath the hypnotic kaleidoscope of colors lies an active volcano.Santorini is part of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, one of the most important volcanic fields in Europe which has seen over 100 eruptions over the past 400,000 years. The East Mediterranean’s most active underwater, and potentially dangerous, volcano, Kolumbo, is five miles northeast of Santorini and part of the same volcanic system.Submerged in the Aegean Sea, Kolumbo has been quiet for nearly 400 years – but it is not asleep. The last time it erupted, in 1650, it killed 70 people and triggered a 40 foot tsunami. Strong earthquakes and aftershocks were recorded, along with toxic gas and plumes of smoke.Scientists know Kolumbo exploding could cause great havoc. Some of the world’s biggest oceanographical expeditions have paid it a visit and monitoring has increased in the last 20 years. One of the largest US research vessels, the JOIDES Resolution deep drilling ship, traveled to Santorini for its first Mediterranean mission between December 2022 and February 2023.The formidable ship brought “an entire floating lab to the area,” says volcanologist and expedition co-chief Tim Druitt. Able to drill at over 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) beneath the surface of the sea, researchers collected previously unreached sediments to try and reconstruct the history of volcanism in the area.The results – initial reports are expected later this year – should help scientists not only predict future eruptions, but also to reveal the behavior of other active volcanoes around the world that pose a threat to millions who live in their vicinity. The links between earthquakes and volcanoes are also being studied.Evi Nomikou, a geological oceanographer at the University of Athens, has taken part in every expedition on her native Santorini for the last 20 years. “We are gradually putting together a geopuzzle [showing] which parts were [originally] land, which parts were water,” she says.“If we can better understand past eruptions and their impact, we have a roadmap to better address future challenges.”The JOIDES Resolution expedition isn’t the first major study of the area. Nomikou says that the long-studied extreme conditions found at Kolumbo led NASA to fund a groundbreaking expedition in 2019. “At the bottom of its crater there is an extra-terrestrial ocean with life forms that can be found on other planets.”The hostile environment, with its active hydrothermal vents spewing hot water and minerals, served as an ideal testing ground for new state-of-the-art technologies using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. NASA tested submersibles that one day, it hopes, will be exploring alien oceans on moons of Jupiter and Saturn.Another recent study also uncovered a previously undetected magma chamber beneath Kolumbo. Scientists believe that the chamber may also be key to understanding the seismic activity in this region.Fuming volcanoes and bubbling craters also fired the imagination of Hollywood producers who chose Santorini as the opening location of adrenaline-pumped 2003 Hollywood blockbuster “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life.” Using Santorini’s dramatic cliffs as a backdrop, Angelina Jolie found herself in hazardous situations in mysterious waters while looking for underwater treasure.Jolie and then-husband Brad Pitt spent vacation time on Santorini following the shoot, and they’re not the only ones. The Kardashians, Lady Gaga and Shakira are among the celebrities who have splashed in Santorini’s crystal-clear waters. Every summer, mega yachts cruise back and forth between Santorini and Greece’s other celebrity magnet, the party island of Mykonos, their VIP passengers revealing their exclusive surroundings in glitzy posts.Brangelina’s romance may be over, but Lara Croft’s adventurous spirit lives on in tourist boat excursions. They include a visit to the volcano of Nea Kameni: one of five islands that form the Santorini volcanic complex, and a national geological park in itself.“The last eruption on Nea Kameni was in the 1950s,” says Marios Fytros, CEO of travel agency Santorini View. “Visitors love the thrill of hiking up to the crater of a volcano. It is one of our most popular excursions.” Boat tours continue with a swim at volcanic hot springs on nearby Palea Kameni island, followed by sundowners on deck facing Santorini’s cliffs.Another popular tour, to the magnificent archaeological site of Akrotiri, serves as a sober reminder of volcanic force. The thriving Bronze Age city was destroyed by the eruption 3,600 years ago, which spewed out a nearly 20-mile high column of ash and rock, entombing the city. Some 1,700 years later, a similar disaster would destroy Pompeii.With the ashes and lava removed, Akrotiri’s vividly colored frescoes today stand beautifully preserved.Thanks to its global fame, Santorini has seen some the biggest tourism investments in the country. Hilton and Nobu are among the brands to have arrived on the island in the past few years, and property prices are among the highest in Greece.Yet geologists – who are closely monitoring Kolumbo – warn that it’s just a matter of time before a big eruption hits again.However, “time” in geology years can be ultra-slow. So much so that one real estate agent on the island, who declined to be named, says that “volcanic activity never enters the conversation” when selling a property.When it does erupt, Kolumbo is capable of producing an eruption column tens of miles high and is also liable to trigger a tsunami. Increased activity about 10 years ago raised concerns but it has since subsided.“If we start seeing increased activity in Kolumbo then we need to be alert, says Druitt. “The good news is that volcanoes do give plenty of warning.”Meanwhile, in 2020, Greece’s Civil Protection Agency unveiled a 185-page plan for addressing the consequences of a possible activation of Santorini’s volcanic group.In their everyday life, locals have little time to think about the volcano beyond  excursions. In summer, the island is packed. Overtourism remains one of the  biggest challenges as Santorini’s unique morphology continues to bring in the crowds. Last year the International Union of Geological Sciences, in collaboration with UNESCO, included the caldera of Santorini in its first list of top 100 Geological World Heritage Sites.Beyond hotels and restaurants, all business on the island is linked to the volcano. Locally made cosmetics are packed with minerals, and premium food ingredients are grown in unique soil. There is a museum dedicated to the Santorini cherry tomato, a Protected Designation of Origin product since 2006, and the island’s fava beans are considered the best in Greece.Then there is Santorini’s most famous export after tourism: wine. Islanders say there’s more wine than water on Santorini.About a fifth of the nearly 30 square mile island is taken up by vineyards, most of which grow assyrtiko, a native grape which produces white wines that are crisp, dry and – unsurprisingly – mineral.The traditional “cave” houses dug into the volcanic rocks, called yposkafa, are prime nesting grounds for honeymooners seeking their dream vacation. But for Nomikou, who grew up on Santorini, it was Kolumbo that featured in her childhood dreams.“I was greatly influenced by my grandfather’s and great grandfather’s stories. They remembered the smaller explosions at Nea Kameni,” she says.“But they insisted that the one to worry about is ‘the one you can’t see’.”“Gradually I realized there was another volcano, under water.

255,279,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/china-europe-airlines-russia-ukraine-airspace/index.html,Russia’s war on Ukraine redrew the map of the sky – but not for Chinese airlines,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","In the early days of the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union and Russia closed off their airspace to each other – an aerial blockade that has remained in place ever since.Now that China has reconnected to the world after almost three years of Covid border closures – welcome news to the world’s recovering tourism markets –  some in the European aviation industry are calling out what they feel is an unlevel playing field.During a visit to China in April, French President Emanuel Macron announced that France-headquartered Airbus landed huge deals in China, as the two countries vowed to “resume airlinks to pre-pandemic levels as quickly as possible.”However, reviving these air links could be a much simpler prospect for Chinese airlines than European.Like other passengers flying on European carriers to Asia, Macron did not take the quickest route between France and China – his plane avoided flying over Russia for both political and security reasons.But because Beijing and Moscow are still friends, direct, quicker routes remain open over Russian airspace, requiring less fuel and bringing better profits.“The closure of Russian airspace for European airlines has forced European carriers to take detours, involving more southern flight routes to East and Southeast Asia,” Laurent Donceel, managing director of Airlines for Europe (A4E) told CNN.“This has resulted in longer flight times and added to the fuel used on these flights.”The biggest airline association in Europe, A4E’s members include major players such as British Airways, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and Finnair, all of which have had routes and flight times affected by the closure of Russian airspace.Finnair, which operates out of a major aviation hub at Helsinki, has been hit the most due to its proximity to Russia, according to Donceel. A flight between Helsinki and Singapore now has an additional 1,400 kilometers (2,250 miles) to negotiate.Between Helsinki and Seoul, that’s an extra 4,000 kilometers one-way.“To put that in context, 1,400 kilometers adds 1.25 hours to the flight, and 4,000 kilometers adds seven hours on a round trip between Helsinki and Seoul,” Donceel said.While that certainly spells more inconvenience for passengers, Donceel added that it also has commercial implications.“This does put European airlines at a competitive disadvantage,” he said.Ben Smith, CEO of the Air France-KLM Group called it an “unfair advantage” in an interview with British newspaper Financial Times published on February 17.French Transport Minister Clément Beaune told CNN at the end of February that he has yet to receive any official complaints from Air France.Currently China Eastern’s direct flights from Shanghai take 12 hours, while Air France, which it partners with through the SkyTeam airline alliance, takes 14 hours.Similarly, the direct flight from Frankfurt to Beijing on German carrier Lufthansa takes 11 hours while its Chinese partner in Star Alliance, Air China, needs only nine hours.Star Alliance declined to comment on this issue.Some Western airlines have abandoned routes to East Asia. Virgin Atlantic put an official end to its London to Hong Kong route in March after almost 30 years of service, citing the logistical impact of the detour.“On the basis of Russian airspace remaining closed, Heathrow – Hong Kong flight times would be approximately 60 minutes longer and Hong Kong – Heathrow flight time would be 1 hours and 50 minutes longer than prior to airspace closure,” the airline told CNN.Founder of Virgin Group, Richard Branson expressed his support for a ban on all Chinese carriers flying to the UK via Russian airspace in an interview with British newspaper The Telegraph at the end of 2022.He told the newspaper that airlines flying over Russia were indirectly helping the Kremlin’s war effort.Russian airspace bordering Ukraine has been closed to all commercial airlines since the start of the invasion.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), in its latest conflict zone information bulletin update on March 16, also advised that airlines flying over Moscow-administered airspace should exercise caution due to “heightened military activity which may include launches of mid-range missiles penetrating into controlled airspace.”The risk of flying in proximity to active conflict zones was brutally highlighted in 2014, when Malaysian Airline MH17 flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing 298 people.Investigators later concluded that the missile which downed the plane was fired from a launcher belonging to Russia’s 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade.China’s European routes do not fly near Ukraine airspace. They primarily enter or depart Russian airspace above the Baltic Sea, near St. Petersburg.Whether Chinese travelers  – or passengers heading on the return leg from Europe – are concerned about the risks of flying through any Russian airspace remains to be seen.CNN has reached out to the three main state-owned Chinese airlines – Air China, China Eastern and China Southern – for comments.For now, Chinese airlines have yet to return to full pre-pandemic capacities. For instance, China Southern Airlines, with its base in the southern city of Guangzhou, will still only have one flight per week for its routes connecting Guangzhou to Paris and Frankfurt for the summer fall season of 2023, while pre-pandemic level was at one flight per day.But as Chinese airlines gradually return to normal and the war in Ukraine continues to rage on,  European airlines could potentially face more fierce challenges on routes between Europe and East or Southeast Asia, creating some interesting choices for passengers.",travel,0.0
256,280,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/cruise-ship-three-years-mv-gemini-passenger-perspective/index.html,She signed up to live on a cruise ship for three years. Here’s why,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","When Sharon Lane heard about a cruise company offering a three-year-long voyage around the world, she immediately started fantasizing about life on board.Life at Sea Cruises is selling places on board the MV Gemini, which sets sail from Istanbul on November 1 on an epic global journey that will take in most of the planet’s prime cruising destinations.Lane, a 75-year-old retired high school teacher from California, is a travel enthusiast. Back in the day, she taught foreign languages and loved taking her students on trips to Europe. In the 1990s, she decamped to Cape Town, South Africa for two years of adventures.More recently, Lane’s become a cruise convert – not just because of the opportunities it affords her to see the world, but because the feeling of being adrift at sea is one of her favorite sensations.“I actually prefer the ocean days, when we’re just sailing through or powering through the oceans, it just thrills me,” Lane tells CNN Travel.While it’s long been Lane’s dream to live on a cruise ship full time, the steep cost has always been a barrier. But when Lane heard about the three-year-voyage from a friend on a Friday night Zoom call, she hung up and spent the rest of the evening researching and budgeting.The cheapest rooms on the MV Gemini cost around $30,000 per year, including a discount for solo travelers. Lane calculated this cost was manageable, and decided to dive in.“By midnight that night, I had done enough research that I booked a room,” she says.Now, Lane is busy preparing for MV Gemini’s November disembarkation. She’s selling most of her possessions, giving up her rental lease and preparing for a long stint at sea.“The logistics are crazy,” says Lane. “It’s a leap of faith, but I know there will be a place here when I get back. Or maybe I’ll end up living in another country. I don’t know, the sky’s the limit.”Lane has opted for one of the cheapest cabins on board – what Life at Sea Cruises’ is calling a “Virtual Inside” room. The 130-square-feet cabin has no window, but guests have been promised a screen that will broadcast live footage from outside the ship.“It shows literally what you would see outside your window if you had one,” says Lane. “And that’s enough for me, it really is.”Lane insists the prospect of three years living in a room with no natural light isn’t daunting. She plans to treat the cabin like a bedroom – she’ll sleep there, but she won’t spend a lot of time there otherwise. During the day, she’ll relax elsewhere on the ship, walking around soaking up the ocean views, or she’ll be busy enjoying exciting excursions.While she plans to sell “95% of her possessions” before setting sail, Lane says she’ll bring along a few family photographs to make the cabin her own. She has a favorite picture of her now-adult grandsons back when they were kids and she took them on a whale-watching trip.“I have that laminated and I’ll take magnets and I’ll stick it to my door for two reasons,” says Lane. “One, I get to see their faces every time I go in, which is always fun, and the other reason is it makes it really easy to know which door is yours, because you’ve got your grandsons smiling back.”Lane hasn’t yet told her daughter or grandsons she’ll be embarking on the cruise. “I don’t want them to try and talk me out of it,” she says. Lane thinks they will support her decision, but three years is a long time, and it’s likely she won’t see much of her loved ones on land while she’s circumnavigating the world.But Lane’s looking forward to video-calling family and friends from far flung locales – and she’s excited to forge new connections on board. She’s heard there will be many solo travelers on the voyage and reckons they will be keen to socialize. In fact, the cruise line has already connected many of the guests via an app, says Lane, and “it’s already a good time.”“We’ve already gotten to know each other – already volunteering to help each other on things and giving each other ideas and answering questions and making plans. It’s already fun.”Lane’s been happily single for a long time, and dismisses the notion she might find romance on board.“That will not happen. It is completely out of my head. I have no interest. I want to make friends,” she says.Plus, when she was making the decision to book onto the three year cruise, she found herself extra thankful for her independence – she’s spoken with people who’ve said they’re keen to sign up, but their partner or spouse isn’t interested, so it’s not happening.“I don’t have that,” she says. “I can stay home if I want to. I can go someplace if I want to. The only thing that keeps me from doing things is health. As long as I control that I’m okay.”Lane suffers from a medical condition in her lungs which she says makes her more susceptible to the effects of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. She’s rarely been out of her home, let alone on vacation, since the pandemic took hold.But rather than being apprehensive about boarding a cruise ship, Lane suggests she’ll be more comfortable on board than on land – she’s confident in the cruise’s Covid measures and the medical facilities available on board, and also plans to take her own precautions.“When I’m on the ship, when I’m any place where there are other people, I’ll wear an N95 mask, a surgical mask and goggles,” she says.Lane won’t disembark the ship in certain destinations, like Antarctica, where the cold air might aggravate her lungs. But she’s very excited for much of the ship’s itinerary, including stop offs in Scotland and Ireland, places she believes her ancestors hailed from, but which she’s never visited before.In total, the MV Gemini will stop at 375 ports over its three-year voyage, with 208 of these including overnight stays. The ship will stop everywhere from India to China to the Maldives to Australia, with some multi-night stopovers.Lane’s excited to see the globe and glad travelers will have time to soak up each destination, but she thinks she’ll spend more time on board the ship than many of her fellow passengers.“For me, the ocean’s the thing,” she says. “The ship itself in the ocean, that’s the draw.”Lane plans to blog her experience – “my goal is to write something every day,” she says. She hopes that the blog, which she writes under a pen name, will allow her to savor the journey and share her adventures with loved ones back home and strangers alike.Lane hopes her dispatches might inspire others to take a risk and push themselves out of their comfort zone. She still regrets the years she spent in midlife, putting off traveling.“I think I was always waiting for the perfect time to go when everything is right in life, when money is right, when appointments are right, when other people want to go,” she says.“Don’t stay home,” she encourages. “Home may be where the heart is, home may be where you hang your hat – hang your hat, and then get on the boat, get on the plane, get in the car, go somewhere.”",travel,0.0
257,281,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chateau-de-savigny-les-beaune-france/index.html,The French château with more than 100 fighter jets,2023-05-02 07:22:00,"The sleek, dark-gray lines of a F-16 Fighting Falcon jet, flanked by two other veterans of the Cold War skies, a French Dassault Mirage IV and a F-104 Starfighter, is not what you would usually expect to come across when walking into the courtyard of a 700-year-old French château.The conspicuous presence of this triad of combat aircraft in such an unlikely setting offers a foretaste of what this historical manor has in store for its guests.Château de Savigny-lès-Beaune, in the little Burgundy village of the same name, dates back to the 14th century and would be just one more of the many wine-growing estates that dot this historical region of France was it not for the personal passions and initiative of one man, Michel Pont.A winegrower, car racer and avid collector, Pont bought the château in 1979 and over the following four decades, until his passing in 2021, turned it into a treasure trove for all those interested in mechanics and engineering.“My father raced Abarth cars for five years, between 1968 and 1973. He kept his cars and, at the same time, started collecting motorbikes too. The majority of them were acquired as scrap,” says Christophe Pont, Michel’s son and current owner and manager of the château.By the late 1970s Pont had already accumulated a significant collection of vehicles, comprising 10 Abarth racing cars and more than 300 vintage motorcycles. He was, however, just getting started. That initial batch of cars and motorcycles kept getting larger and larger and it soon started branching out.In the mid-1980s, Pont, who was ex-military, made inquiries with the French Air Force about the possibility of getting one of their decommissioned Mirage III fighter jets to exhibit at the château. The request was granted and six months later what would become the kernel of the world’s largest private fighter aircraft collection was on its way to Savigny-lès-Beaune.It’s not an exaggeration to say that quite a few national aerospace museums would be envious of what’s on display: around 100 aircraft of different makes and provenances all perfectly lined up in the grounds of the château.The list reads like a “who’s who” of 20th-century military aviation: several different versions of French Mirages and Mystères, American F-100 series fighters and Soviet-made MiGs and Sukhois are among the many types of airplanes and helicopters you can find here.For years, Michel and Christophe Pont scouted the whole of Europe and beyond in order to expand their collection. Those aircraft they could procure were then dismantled and brought over to Château-Savigny to be reassembled on site.As the exhibits kept growing in size and scope, the word spread and the Pont family soon started to get offers to take in all sorts of machinery.Many of them eventually found their place at the chateau, which now boasts nine different exhibition areas ranging from satellites and space technology to tractors and wine-making equipment, in addition to the aforementioned collections of aircraft, Abarth racing cars and historical motorcycles.If the outdoor aircraft display is enough to get any aviation geek’s heartbeat racing, the scope and diversity of the other collections can also be overwhelming at times.The whole scale of this extravaganza becomes ever more apparent as you visit the several pavilions scattered throughout the estate or slowly make your way through the château’s halls and corridors.As you move from one room to the other, each seemingly packed to the hilt with thousands upon thousands of scale models of pretty much every conceivable type of aircraft that has ever flown and every make of car that has been produced, you stumble upon countless other interesting items, from ejector seats and fighter jet canopies to disassembled engines, strewn all over the place in an apparently random fashion.One of Château-Savigny’s most colorful collections, in a literal sense, is perhaps the fire trucks, which was set up with the collaboration of Jean-Claude Picot, a friend of Pont Senior.Picot used to run a business building emergency vehicles and, upon his retirement, brought to the chateau his private fire truck collection, which shows the evolution of firefighting equipment throughout the whole of the 20th century.Then there’s the room dedicated to naval matters. Remarkably for a place that is hundreds of miles from the sea, the château not only has a small naval exhibit, but is home also to several Bertin hovercraft. These were designed in the 1960s by Jean Bertin, a French engineer who is also credited for the development of the Aérotrain, a futuristic technology to run high-speed trains on an air cushion that slides over concrete tracks. The “Bertins” were recovered by Pont from a scrap heap and brought over to the chateau where they now stand next to one of the property’s vineyards.“At the moment I am no longer looking to add museum pieces,” Christophe Pont tells CNN, “My main goal is to preserve and continue the work of my father. I must ensure the continuity of the collections. It is with this goal in mind that I have resold some items. This has allowed me to purchase part of the collections from my brothers and has also given me the opportunity to trim the collections a bit in order to highlight some the most valuable pieces.” His wish for the future is that “twenty years from now, our aircraft collection will be housed in an indoors museum that protects it from the weather.”All these many and varied interests have not prevented the Pont family from continuing to tend to the estate’s vineyards. After all, the château’s traditional line of business has always been, and continues to be, wine-making.While most of the 30,000 visitors the château gets every year are attracted by its unique collections, there is also an offering for those interested in plain and simple wine tourism.With the Bourgogne wine region boasting up to 84 designations of origin for wine (“Appellations d’Origine Contrôlées” or AOC, in French), including one specific to the village of Savigny-lès-Beaune, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Château-Savigny has also its own wine-tasting rooms and shop as well.Regardless of the reason that brings you to this corner of rural France, better set aside some time in your schedule, because this most eclectic of French châteaux is guaranteed to keep you busy for a good while.Château de Savigny-les-Beaune,  Rue Général Leclerc, 21420 Savigny-lès-Beaune, France; +33 3 80 21 55 03",travel,0.0
258,282,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/king-charles-coronation-royal-london-restaurants-places/index.html,"Where the royal family goes in London, from Indian restaurants to theme parks",2023-05-01 23:43:00,"Royals? They’re just like us! Well, they’re not, obviously – but sometimes they do put down their tiaras, leave their palaces and join the hoi polloi at restaurants, bars and even theme parks.If you’re a fan of the British royal family, you’ll likely have already visited sites like Buckingham Palace, Windsor and Hampton Court (and if you haven’t, here’s our guide on where to start).Keen to soak up a different kind of royal atmosphere? Here are 18 places in and around London where the Windsors have been spotted walking among us.Brilliant by name, and brilliant by nature, at least if King Charles III is to be believed. He once called Brilliant Restaurant in Southall, west London his favorite Indian restaurant – and Gordon Ramsay is also a fan.If you’re flying into Heathrow for your royal visit, that’s brilliant news – since the restaurant is on the way into central London, and an easy 12-minute walk from Southall station, which serves the equally royal Elizabeth Line.The Anand family opened the Brilliant in 1975 – today it’s run by the third generation – and the food is Punjabi with Kenyan influences (the family previously had a restaurant in Nairobi).If you prefer something more central, chef Dipna Anand also has a restaurant in the city center, Dipna Anand at Somerset House. Brilliant!The late Queen Elizabeth was apparently a big fan of chocolate – so far, so relatable.What might surprise you, though, is that her favorite chocolatier sounded rather more French than British.Charbonnel et Walker, in the glitzy shopping quarter of Bond Street, was founded in 1875 by two women: one a chocolatier from Paris, the other a London artisan who made jewelry and hat boxes.The company has held a royal warrant from the late Queen since 1970 – the chief chocolatier previously revealed that Her Majesty had “very floral tastes,” and hinted that she liked their rose and violet creams.Predictably they have a whole range of coronation-related chocolates and hampers. Extra royal nugget – Charbonnel and Walker were apparently introduced to each other by the King Edward VII prior to his own ascension to the throne.Back in the noughties, party Prince Harry was a regular at Mahiki, a Tiki-themed bar-club-restaurant in Mayfair. It’s been going strong since 2006, in no small part thanks to the early patronage of the then-young royals.Kate and William were fans, too, and Jack Brooksbank, who’s now married to Princess Eugenie, was once manager.Try the signature Treasure Chest cocktail, which William apparently liked: “grog,” Courvoisier and peach liqueur tipped into a pirate-style chest and swilled with Champagne. The price? That depends on whether you’re using Moet, Dom Perignon or Louis Roederer as the mixer, darling. From $199 to $835 – but it serves eight.Another Harry favorite, Maggie’s is still going strong on posh Sloane Square. It’s a 1980s-themed club named after Margaret Thatcher, the former Conservative Prime Minister whose photo is everywhere inside.So the story goes, back in the 1980s, when Princess Diana was the most famous woman on the planet, she dressed up in drag to visit the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, one of London’s best known gay bars.In her memoir, Diana’s friend, actress Cleo Rocos told of an afternoon spent drinking with the princess, comedian Kenny Everett and Queen singer Freddy Mercury, followed by a trip to the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in the evening.To avoid being spotted, the princess dressed up as a “beautiful young man” – and even managed to get a round of drinks in without being spotted.Designer Jenny Packham’s name has become synonymous with a certain Catherine, Princess of Wales, who’s been wearing Packham’s dresses since the early days of her marriage, from the short blue polka dots she wore coming out of hospital having given birth to Prince George, to the shimmering gold affair she wore for the “No Time to Die” premiere.You’ll find her ready-to-wear collection at her flagship store in Mayfair.In his memoir “Spare,” Prince Harry wrote about popping out to shop for clothes at T.K. Maxx on Kensington High Street, just a few minutes’ walk from his home in Kensington Palace.This is, of course, the same chain as T.J. Maxx in the States – and does the same thing, selling designer brands at discount prices. There are branches scattered all over London, so you can pick up some clothes fit for a prince at a suitably pauper-ish price.Remember those famous photos of Princess Diana riding a log flume with William and Harry?They were taken at Thorpe Park, a theme park about 25 miles west of London, where the family visited every year from 1991 to 1993, when the famous shots were taken.The royals didn’t get any special treatment – they paid for entry and stood in line for the rides with everyone else.The ride in the photos, Logger’s Leap, was the UK’s highest log flume, but closed in 2015, and the theme park is now wanting to redevelop the area around it. Today’s rides are rather more complex – like Stealth, which goes from zero to 80mph in just over two seconds.Queen Camilla revealed in an interview last year that one of her favorite restaurants in her London youth was La Poule au Pot, a French bistrot straddling the central neighborhoods of Belgravia and Pimlico that’s been going strong since 1962.You don’t need to be on a royal budget to eat there, either – the prix fixe menus cost $44 for two courses, or $50 for three. Dishes are basic French classics, like onion tart, cassoulet stew and boeuf bourguignon.Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has long been a fan of the Soho House group of private members’ clubs, and she’s paid several visits to Soho Farmhouse, its resort-style country outpost in Oxfordshire, including a trip with friends before her relationship with Prince Harry became public, and again a couple of months before the wedding.Its 114 bedrooms are in the main farmhouse, plus privacy-aiding cabins and huts plonked in over 100 acres of countryside and even an artificial lake.The farmhouse is also home to a restaurant and Cowshed spa. Rooms cost from £335 per night, though they’re incredibly sought after and availability is low. Non-members can technically book rooms at Soho House properties – but you need to take out a $130-per-year “Soho Friends” deal to book.Another Soho House outpost, 76 Dean Street is of course where Harry and Meghan had their first date in 2016 – a self-described sweaty prince who’d been stuck in traffic turned up late to meet the woman of his dreams over cocktails – which, luckily, turned out just fine.While you have to be a member to go there, just a few doors down at number 69-71 is Dean Street Townhouse, also owned by the group but with a restaurant open to the public.On the menu: modern British done well, from fancy fish and chips to rump of lamb with cabbage and mint.The Goring has always been the hotel of choice for the Windsors – the Queen Mother used to come here for lunch, rumor has it the Queen herself was a low-key visitor, and the-then Kate Middleton used it as her bridal HQ for her 2011 wedding. It was just around from the in-laws for her – the hotel is just across the road from the back garden of Buckingham Palace.The only hotel in London to have a royal warrant – essentially an official vote of confidence from the family – it’s still a refined kind of place, known for its excellent afternoon teas and its huge, semi-secret garden out the back, which is not quite as large as those at Buckingham Palace, but not bad for central London.With its nod-nod-wink-wink to former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi’s sleaze scandals,  Italian restaurant Bunga Bunga was all the rage when it opened in Battersea, south London, in 2011.Harry was the first royal in – he was seen dancing in the street at 3 a.m. after spending the evening there in 2012 – and William and Kate paid a visit two years later, shortly after the arrival of Prince George.The Battersea branch is closed these days, but Bunga Bunga lives on in tourist-friendly Covent Garden, where it offers an “immersive dining experience” with cabaret every Friday and Saturday night.The-then Meghan Markle was apparently spied In the heart of Chelsea while she was engaged to Prince Harry, getting a facial from Sarah Chapman.Chapman is facialist to the stars, with customers including celebs like Jourdan Dunn, Gigi Hadid, Victoria Beckham and Uma Thurman.She’s known for her massages which drain excess fluid from the skin. Facials cost from £170 for an hour, or you can buy her products at her boutique behind Sloane Square.Emerging as flawless as the Duchess of Sussex is not guaranteed.As royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, the Princess of Wales makes regular appearances in the Royal Box at Wimbledon during the annual two-week tennis championships – and she’s usually joined by other members of the family.The club offers year-round tours of the museum and grounds, including Centre Court, where the finals take place – and where the Royal Box is situated. Unfortunately you can’t sit there for a photoshoot – only members of the club (and royals) have access, and plebeian posteriors are not permitted.On the plus side, you get behind-the-scenes access to the players’ changing rooms – so you can take that Instagram shot on tennis royalty Roger Federer’s usual bench instead.Both the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Sussex have been spotted doing the superstore run – Kate has been snapped at a branch of well-to-do Waitrose, while Meghan was seen before her wedding stocking up at Whole Foods, the pricey US chain that has branches in the UK.Her local was the one on Kensington High Street – just opposite Harry’s old shopping ground, T.K. Maxx.In 2012, Queen Elizabeth II came to Fortnum & Mason, London’s poshest grocery store, to have afternoon tea with the-then Duchesses of Cornwall and Cambridge, to celebrate her 60 years on the throne. The Queen remarked on the violet creams up for grabs, which suggests Carbonnel & Walker’s chocolatier wasn’t lying when he said they were her favorites.Fortnum’s was founded in 1707 and is best known for its fancy picnic hampers – if it’s a good day, take one to St James’s Park – in view of Buckingham Palace – for a treat, and keep the hamper itself as a right royal souvenir.",travel,0.0
259,283,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/uncrowded-beach-destinations-mexico/index.html,These beautiful Mexican beach areas won’t be mobbed,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Finding your own stretch of sand in Mexico is not too daunting. This country has around 5,800 miles of coastline (9,330 kilometers), and only a fraction of that is developed for visitors.Since most international vacationers head to the same few resort areas, that leaves a lot of beaches untouched, particularly for visitors willing to get a bit lost now and then.Many of these are completely off the grid, however. They’re not served by paved roads and are  accessible only with a sturdy vehicle or a boat charter.Overnight visits to nature reserve beaches require signing up with an adventure tour operator with permission to set up camping facilities. These would include Espíritu Santo Island near La Paz or the barrier islands of Magdalena Bay on the other side of Baja, a top spot to see baby gray whales swimming with their mothers.These lesser-known beaches seldom see big crowds and traffic, but for added relaxation, you can order a Pacifico and ceviche with your toes in the sand or find a place to stay overnight.For visitors willing to pay for exclusivity, several resorts on the Costalegre coast between Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo have beaches on their property that outsiders would only be able to reach by boat. The newest is Four Seasons Tamarindo, which opened at the end of 2022.At the 2,000-acre (809-hectare) Las Alamandas, which has its own airstrip, staffers can arrange for your group to have a whole beach to itself for one day. The resort has three from which to choose in addition to the main one in front of the rooms and restaurant.Intrepid travelers on a budget can find plenty of “secret beaches” along this Jalisco coast, too, starting just south of Puerto Vallarta and Mismaloya. Most are down the end of a dirt road or next to a two-store town full of fishing families, but hotel rooms are available at Mayto Beach, which goes on for miles.Few foreign visitors make it to the Oaxacan coast on the Pacific, though for surfers, the words “Puerto Escondido” are legendary. The high waves here are some of the most challenging in the Americas. So the main two-mile-long (3.2 kilometers) Playa Zicatela is better for strolling than swimming.Walking distance from the center of town is much calmer Playa Carrizalillo, where beachgoers can rent a chair for the day, order some drinks and fish tacos, and watch less skilled surfers taking lessons. Past that heading northwest is pocket beach Playa Coral and then very long and mostly empty Playa Bacocho.The crowds thin out even more about an hour east at Mazunte and Zipolite, beaches popular with backpackers and long-stay guests. (Be forewarned: Zipolite is a nude beach.)Find bargain-priced rentals and thin crowds – outside of local holiday periods anyway – at the Gulf Coast beaches stretching from Telchac Puerto to Celestún. These beach towns north of Yucatán state’s capital, Mérida, are just dots on the map in both directions from port city Progreso.There are no high-rise hotels and few resorts along this coast, with Reef Yucatán being the only all-inclusive option on the water. It’s more common for visitors to rent a beach house of some kind, ranging from small cottages at bargain rates to 10-bedroom villas with an infinity pool.The Riviera Maya of Quintano Roo is built up with hundreds of resorts between Holbox Island down through Cancún to Tulum, so every decade it gets harder to find a mellow Caribbean beach on this coast.Almost all the way to Belize, however, the small settlement of Mahahual still feels sleepy and undiscovered. Most of the visitors are quick-stop cruise ship passengers calling at the purpose-built Costa Maya port on the northern edge of town, but after they’ve pulled out, the beach goes back to being empty.Only a few hotels here are more than $100 per night. Some are in the $35 to $70 range, so it’s easy to stick around for a while for snorkeling off the shore, a scuba diving excursion to Banco Chinchorro or kayaking the nearby lagoons.Technically, all beaches in Mexico are open to everyone, but the private beach clubs of the Punta Mita development north of Puerto Vallarta are really accessible only to homeowners and renters inside the massive gated community.The two luxury resorts in the complex – Four Seasons and St. Regis – have their own long stretches of beach that are occupied by hotel guests. The price of renting a villa or hotel suite within the gates of Punta Mita comes with the assurance of lounging on an uncrowded, pristine Pacific beach.For a nearby option that doesn’t require any credentials, Playa Litibu is a walk down the sand from Punta Mita’s Kupuri Beach Club.Chiapas is known as an adventure state with jungles, Mayan ruins and the mountain city of San Cristóbal de las Casas.It does have a few nice beaches – and ones that only see a crowd if it’s a Mexican holiday period, when residents of the capital Tuxtla Gutiérrez head to the shore. The Puerto Arista beach is 20 miles long (32 kilometers) so there’s bound to be a quiet spot on the sand on the Pacific.The upscale resort Hotel Tachinaste can top $250 a night for double occupancy in high season, but most hotels in the area go for less than $100 a night.Todos Santos, about an hour north of Cabo San Lucas, has a main beach that doesn’t get all that crowded, with just a few hotels along its roughly 10 miles (16 kilometers) of sandy shores. Since the town itself is on the other side of a lagoon, it’s easy to find an isolated stretch of beach to enjoy.Lace up some hiking shoes, however, and you can trek across the tops of dramatic cliffs to reach Playa Las Palmas, a gorgeous crescent of sand that can otherwise only be reached by four-wheel-drive. This one is good for swimming, while other beaches, such as Playa La Pastora, are better for surfing and boogie boarding.",travel,0.0
260,284,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/lusail-qatar/index.html,Inside Qatar’s ‘city of the future’,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","There’s a party going on in Lusail.The palm-fringed Marina Walk, leading from the Arabian Gulf to the wide expanse that is Lusail Boulevard, is full of food stalls representing pretty much every nationality living in Qatar, and the boulevard is buzzing with life. This annual International Food Festival – the next edition is slated for January 24 - February 4, 2024 – is one of many events in Lusail. Like others, it has moved from the capital Doha to this, Qatar’s newest city – 10 miles north.Touted as Qatar’s “City of the Future,” construction of Lusail began in 2006, long before Qatar was announced as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup – yet you’d have been hard pushed to have found many people who had visited before the grand Lusail Stadium became the main stage for the soccer tournament.Those who came found there’s more to the city than event spaces. Lusail is home to grand shopping malls, theme parks, a wealth of international restaurants, islands, and two iconic new additions to the Qatar skyline.The Katara Towers, the near-circular building modeled on the scimitar swords that make up Qatar’s emblem, play host to two luxury hotels, the Fairmont Doha and the all-suite Raffles Doha, the country’s first six-star hotel. Both are the first properties for their respective hotel groups in Qatar – and while they’re Doha by name, they’re firmly Lusail by location.Then there are the four subtly twisting Lusail Plaza Towers, which seem to morph in height and shape as you approach the city. They’re the work of Foster + Partners, who also designed the Lusail Stadium. Suspended between them is a shimmering metallic sculpture – a great whale-shark, “Al Nehem,” by Italian artist Marco Balich.Nineteen residential, business and mixed districts make up Lusail, some more developed than others – since the city is still under construction. The stadium and Lusail Plaza Towers are connected by Lusail Boulevard, which regularly plays host to parades and events, from the food festival to the annual Classic Car Show.The anticipated Lusail Museum, which is still under construction, was designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron. Exhibiting orientalist and Middle Eastern art, it’s slated to open in 2029.Tethered to the city shoreline by a six lane highway is entertainment-focused Al Maha Island, home to the Winter Wonderland theme park and a slew of international restaurants.It’s swiftly becoming a rival in the livability stakes to crowded Doha.Lusail claims to be Qatar’s first sustainable city – no easy task for a newbuild in the desert.Raising a city from the sand needs a lot of imagination.“The future of infrastructure is unlimited in the Middle East,” says Bryce McDevitt, vice president of Parsons Corporation, which is overseeing construction. “There is a sense of imagination and possibility that doesn’t exist anywhere else. Building a clean-sheet city allows for tailored design of your objectives: sustainability, accessibility and economic equality.”He adds: “One major advantage of the ‘from the sand’ approach is that when designing and building a city from scratch, we are not fettered by existing infrastructure. Roadways, airports, public transit, landscape, and urban design can all be built with smart sustainability in mind.”Over the past few decades, little thought has been given to sustainability in Qatar – a desert state which has used its oil and gas resources to bring life to the barren land. Parks in the country’s cities stay green all year round, and even have air-conditioned walkways to allow residents to take strolls even during summer, where temperatures can exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 F).Lusail is changing that mindset, with sustainable tweaks built into the construction. There is a tram system designed to reduce the need for cars (essential elsewhere in Qatar), and systems to conserve and reuse water – for example, planting native vegetation which will reverse desertification and reduce rain runoff, as well as watering plants with non-potable water. An artificial reef is being built along the Lusail shoreline to encourage marine life to settle.It’s the sustainability, space and amenities – as well as plenty of green spaces – which appealed to Katie Warner, a mobile travel agent originally from Australia. She and her husband swapped Doha for Lusail because it felt more ecologically minded. “It was pleasing to discover our building had sustainable systems in place like recycling water for the gardens, solar panels to heat the building’s water, gas services for all cooking appliances, regulated electric use, and separate recycling and general waste chutes on each floor,” she says.But that’s not the only reason they moved: “I love this area full of greenery, the gorgeous boardwalk, and views of the Persian Gulf.  It has all the day-to-day needs for groceries, transport, entertainment, and dining. There’s an extensive choice from food trucks at the Lusail Marina Food Arena, abundant cafes, and fine dining restaurants.”While Lusail’s districts are each pretty much self-contained, and similar to the “15-minute city” concept loved by urban planners, overall Lusail – which sprawls across nearly 15 square miles, with an anticipated population of around 200,000 – still suffers a little from the disjointedness of many Gulf cities.Al Tara – the district, by Al Maha Island, where Warner lives – is home to the Lusail Marina. There are footpaths overlooking the water, art installations, small cafes dotted along the marina, and the Katara Towers. From here, it is just about possible to walk to Place Vendôme, a grand Paris-inspired shopping mall, and beyond it the Waldorf Astoria hotel, which sits on Lusail’s only private beach. Trying to reach Lusail Boulevard is still somewhat of an undertaking, but one that is being addressed by the tram line, which began operation in 2022 and connects with the Doha metro.But while Lusail has superb – even newly iconic – architecture, grand outdoor spaces, and festivals and events, it will never have the organically grown, higgledy-piggledy layout of old Doha, which draws the tourists.Instead, it aims to be a modern, sustainable “City of the Future.” Will it fall foul of the repeated curse that seems to befall many previous attempts of newly constructed cities, such as Canberra, Brasilia, Islamabad and Milton Keynes, where natural atmosphere and joie de vivre seem to be somewhat lacking? Only time will tell.There is a rumor – as yet unsubstantiated – that Lusail might eventually become Qatar’s capital city. It’s not actually a crazy idea – Sheikh Jassim Bin Mohammed Bin Thani, regarded as the founder of Qatar, built Lusail Castle, his 19th-century (and long gone) home, on the coast here.

261,285,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/theme-park-designer-cmd/index.html,What it’s like to be a theme park designer,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Taylor Jeffs is living his dream.Growing up in Orange County, California, near Disneyland and Knott’s Berry Farm, he visited some of the world’s best theme parks on a regular basis.“Back then, it definitely wasn’t cool to be into theme parks, but I was obsessed,” Jeffs, 39, tells CNN.“I understood how special and important they can be and would dream about working in the industry.”Fast-forward a few decades later, and he’s overseen some of the world’s most immersive rides and parks as the co-owner, president and chief creative officer of Legacy Entertainment, a leading entertainment design and production firm based in California.In addition to theme parks, Jeffs has also been involved in a range of creative pursuits, such as producing hit Broadway and off-Broadway shows, choreographing drone shows, and consulting as a creative director for Cirque du Soleil.From hustling at Disneyland as a teen to designing and building theme parks around the globe, Jeffs shares what it’s like to create immersive worlds that bring families together.Obsessed with Disneyland from a young age, Jeffs wanted to work there as soon as possible.At the time, you had to be at least 17 years old, he recalls, but luckily, he found a loophole.“Through California’s ROP (regional occupational program), I could earn high school credits instead of money, so at 15, I got a job as a sub-burger flipper – a rung below a burger flipper – at a restaurant in Frontierland,” he recalls.Later, he worked as a Disney tour guide and then conducted park surveys for the marketing team.“Every day, I’d hear how much people loved the park’s scale and colors, landscapes and music,” recalls Jeffs. “Hearing that feedback on a daily basis, and learning how much they valued the experience was an important foundation for my career.”Jeffs worked at Disneyland for five years before joining what was then the Goddard Group (now Legacy Entertainment) in 2002 as an intern.The group had recently laid off hundreds of employees due to a steep decline in tourism following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.The resulting all-hands-on-deck atmosphere enabled Jeffs to work on high-profile projects, from Hershey’s Chocolate World to the Georgia Aquarium.In 2008, then 24, Jeffs designed and produced his first attraction: “Glow in the Park,” a family-friendly night parade at Six Flags Mexico.He had a relatively small budget – “$1.5 million all-in, less than half of what Disney would spend on a single parade float at the time,” he estimates – but brought several big names on board, like Raul Rodriguez, who designed hundreds of floral floats for California’s Rose Parade, and Benoît Jutras, a principal Cirque du Soleil composer.With its illuminated floats, original soundtrack, dancers, drummers and cartoon characters, the parade was so successful Six Flags commissioned five more for other parks in the chain.After the Great Recession in 2008, the company shifted its focus to Asia.They’ve since built an impressive portfolio, from Studio City Macau to Chimelong Marine Science Park in China, Lotte Worlds in South Korea, Trans Studio parks in Indonesia, Shanghai Haichang Ocean Park and the Sea Shell Aquarium in Vietnam, to name a few.When it comes to designing theme parks, Jeffs says the process begins with a feasibility study, followed by a “blue sky” brainstorm in which the team throws out their wildest ideas.“We just go nuts – attraction ideas, crazy restaurant concepts, social media moments, landscape possibilities, all of it,” Jeffs explains. “I also collect around 200 benchmark images, like a book of inspiration, to gauge what resonates and what doesn’t.”After receiving client feedback, they start sketching and diagramming the park’s layout and key features.Over several iterations, the park design becomes increasingly specific – down to the placement of light posts and the number of turnstiles – until it’s time to start construction.“Often, design continues during construction,” he adds. “And then ideally, we will have producers, managers, technical directors, art directors on the ground through opening day.”Every so often, one of those blue-sky ideas gets the green light.Jeffs points to the immersive “Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Strike” ride at Trans Studio Cibubur, part of Indonesia’s largest theme park chain, as an example.In a conventional dark ride experience, a vehicle moves through a themed world with music, blacklights and special effects.But Jeffs and his team pitched a plot twist. What if the ride broke down and passengers would have to grab flashlights and continue on foot while a monster attacks, then reboard to fight the monster and escape?“We didn’t think they’d go for it, but they did! And then we even had some of our own people saying, ‘That’s crazy. It won’t work.’ But we figured out a way – and now it’s now one of the most successful dark rides in recent history ” says Jeffs.In another instance, they reimagined the “pre-show” concept – typically, a video that plays before the ride begins.“The ride was all about escaping, so we thought: instead of a video, what if we lock you in a jail cell, and you have to solve a puzzle to break out of before you start the ride?”And then there was the Golden Reel.In Macau, Jeffs helped design Studio City Macau, a Hollywood-themed hotel, and the Golden Reel – the world’s first figure-eight Ferris wheel – in the middle of the hotel’s facade.“We came up with the idea to build a Ferris wheel between the towers. But it was Lawrence Ho, the founder of Studio City, who wanted to do a figure-eight because eight is a lucky number in Chinese culture as a homonym for wealth,” says Jeffs.“Lawrence said he didn’t care if the ride was empty – it was all about the wow factor.”But in most cases, wild and crazy ideas won’t fly unless they satisfy commercial needs.“It’s an art and a science – these two things have to meet,” says Jeffs. “Capacity drives everything, so we need to make sure that there’s plenty to do and people don’t spend their entire visit waiting in line.”Moreover, every member of the family should be able to have a good time.“It’s our job to make sure there is a variety – enough attractions without height requirements for parents with babies, thrill rides for teenagers, and parades and shows for everyone,” he adds.That was his approach when designing Lotte World Adventure in Busan, South Korea, which opened in 2022.From family-friendly trains to flume rides, hair-raising roller coasters, parades and stage shows and immersive restaurants, there’s something for every age group.For a timeless feel, the team took cues from European gardens, incorporating lush green spaces, plazas and water features that will “only get more beautiful with time,” says Jeffs.“When I was growing up, theme park design was often dismissed as a rinky-dink, second-class artistic discipline simply because it was rarely well done.“I’m happy to say that this is unquestionably no longer the case. Over the last 15 years, we’ve seen the fulfillment of what this medium can be when it’s firing on all cylinders.”As expected, a demanding travel schedule comes with the territory.Before the pandemic, Jeffs would spend a week each month in Asia, meeting with various clients and governments.“I’ve flown over 3 million miles, stayed over four years in hotels, collected around 2,000 hotel room keys, and visited six out of seven continents – all as part of the job,” he says.When travel came to a halt in 2020, he embarked on a road trip across America with his family.“That first summer, we drove 10,000 miles and hit up virtually any theme park that had managed to re-open,” he says.The family had so much fun that they spent two months on the road the following summer, including a month at Walt Disney World in Florida.And though he’s ridden over 600 roller coasters and explored theme parks worldwide, Disneyland in California remains his all-time favorite park.“From a design standpoint, it’s perfect. It’s the only park Walt Disney worked on personally,” Jeffs gushes.“And since film production designers staged it, the forced perspective of the buildings on Main Street, the human scale of the architecture, the color choices, the castle, the intimacy of the lands – you don’t get that at any other Disney park in quite the same way.”These days, rediscovering the magic of theme parks with his two daughters – aged 5 and 1.5 – has made him appreciate them all the more.“When I go to parks with my family, we’ve found that babies and toddlers can’t participate in many of the attractions. It has focused my thinking when building programs for our parks,” says Jeffs.“While we can’t forgo height restrictions entirely, I now find myself  incorporating more universal entertainment experiences that the whole family can enjoy together.”",travel,0.0
262,286,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/imphal-india-mothers-market-intl-hnk/index.html,Ima Keithel: The world’s largest women-run market,2023-05-02 03:15:00,"At first glance, Ima Keithel is much like any other market. Lines of vendors are here from dusk until dawn, eagerly flogging everything from fresh fruit to fish and fabrics.But after walking through its huge network of more than 5,000 stalls spread across three multi-story buildings and a sea of surrounding tin shacks, one unique aspect becomes hard to ignore: every single trader, without exception, is a woman.“We are just like family, we’re sisters,” says Meilani Chingangbam, a 65-year-old who has been selling religious ritual products like incense and shrine decorations at the market since 2002. “It’s a beautiful place to work. Everyone is trusting and kind.”Ima Keithel – meaning “mother’s market” in the local Meitei language – in Imphal, the capital of India’s northeastern state of Manipur, is said to be the largest women-only market in the world. Men can enter the space – but only to buy goods, to work as porters or guards or to provide the women with cups of milky chai.During the early morning rush, the scent of eromba, a local dish of mashed potato, bamboo shoots and dried fish chutney, sizzles through the air. In one corner, a group of matriarchs are huddled around discussing problems with delayed deliveries and subpar produce.All the while, women stop by to leave offerings at the shrine of Ima Imoinu, the goddess of wealth and business and the market’s main protector.The crowded aisles are stacked high with all manner of delightful treasures: fragrant pinewood and jade-colored betel nut leaves, handcrafted pottery and bamboo baskets, fine silken blankets and rugs in technicolor hues.Filling the spaces in between them are rows of traders wearing vibrant pink, yellow, red and green shawls, some with Manipuri chandon marks on their foreheads, others wrapped in Muslim head scarves.“You can get absolutely anything you could dream of here,” says Lina Moirangthem, a local Meitei tour guide. “The market is cheap and right in the heart of the city. The entire state’s economy practically runs thanks to these women.”Per custom, only women who are married can officially trade in the market, and to gain a space in the official area, a woman must be nominated by a retiring vendor, who will usually choose a successor she is related to like a sister, daughter or cousin.Priya Kharaibam, for example, is the third generation of her family’s pottery traders at Ima Keithel, following on from her grandmother. “I am proud to run the family business,” says the 34-year-old, flanked by a wall of terracotta pots.The creation of Ima Keithel dates back to the 16th century Kangleipak Kingdom, when it began as a makeshift, open-air market for bartering crops. To bolster the war efforts against the neighboring Burmese and Chinese, in 1533 conscription was made mandatory in Manipur and all men were trained as warriors from a young age to protect the kingdom’s perimeters, which run along the border with Myanmar.It was left, then, for the women to run the city.“The market was run by women of the state in open air,” says Lokendra Arambam, a former scholar of the region’s precolonial period at Manipur University. “It began as an all-female activity of selling fish, vegetables and other economic products.”Thanks to Imphal’s easily-accessible, strategic position at the center of Manipur, the city gradually grew to become the economic hub of the region, and the women of Ima Keithel became more and more influential.But beyond the day-to-day business trading and exchange, the hardy matriarchs of Ima Keithel have also played a crucial role in social and political activism in Manipur throughout the 500-year-old history of the market right up to this day.In 1891, for example, the women’s protests forced a backtrack on reforms introduced by the British colonizers that favored external trade over them. In 1939, angered at the British policy of exporting local rice to other parts of India, they confronted the army in what was the Anishuba Nupilan, or Second Women’s War – and won.More recently, when the state government announced plans to build a shopping mall on the market’s site in 2003, they organized weeks-long mass strikes, bringing the economy to a standstill and forcing a reversal. Even now, the women hold regular protests to exert influence, and their input has a serious sway on local elections.“There’s a huge strength of women working here,” says Thoudam Ongbi Shanti, president of one of the market’s vendors’ groups. “But we are not extraordinary people, we just want to make ends meet. We want to be responsible mothers.”These days Ima Keithel is a microcosm of Manipur’s egalitarian society. The state has one of the highest female literacy rates in India and it is seen as a pioneer for gender equality across the country. And while the vast majority of Manipur’s population is the local Meitei ethnic group, true to its progressive values the market also houses Hindi women as well as those representing the state’s 33 indigenous groups.Tungdar Makunga, a 50-year-old vendor from the Maring tribe who occupies a spot in a part of the less formal tin-roofed outer area, is among them.“Even though I only started here recently and I’m not officially registered, the other women are very cooperative and friendly,” she says. “They make space for me if I need it.”Others have used the freedom of the market to break out of traditional social norms.The 80-year-old fabric seller Nongmai Them Khumsonbi says that when she was a newlywed her husband, at the time a low-paid government clerk, opposed her wish to become a trader at the market because he did not believe a woman should work.“He didn’t want me to go out,” she grins. “But I won the argument. And I eventually started earning more than him.”Not everything has been a smooth transaction for these women, however. In January 2016, a magnitude-6.7 earthquake sustained serious damage to the market buildings, and it took almost two years to rebuild. Closures that lasted more than a year during the pandemic also took a toll on the livelihoods of the traders.But now business is back in full flow at this pioneering yet centuries-old market of mothers in remote northeastern India, every day a mesmeric mix of vibrant colors, sounds and smells – and the positive effects for the women are priceless.“I love my work from the heart, I do it passionately,” says Oinam Ongbi Jayela, a 64-year-old tailor and widow. “But it’s not just work. I’m relaxed here. It makes me happy to be with these women. Being here, I feel that I will live for a long time.”",travel,0.0
263,287,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/high-speed-rail-us/index.html,High speed trains are racing across the world. But not in America,"09:39 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","High speed trains have proved their worth across the world over the past 50 years.It’s not just in reducing journey times, but more importantly, it’s in driving economic growth, creating jobs and bringing communities closer together. China, Japan and Europe lead the way.So why doesn’t the United States have a high-speed rail network like those?For the richest and most economically successful nation on the planet, with an increasingly urbanized population of more than 300 million, it’s a position that is becoming more difficult to justify.Although Japan started the trend with its Shinkansen “Bullet Trains” in 1964, it was the advent of France’s TGV in the early 1980s that really kick-started a global high-speed train revolution that continues to gather pace.But it’s a revolution that has so far bypassed the United States. Americans are still almost entirely reliant on congested highways or the headache-inducing stress of an airport and airline network prone to meltdowns.China has built around 26,000 miles (42,000 kilometers) of dedicated high-speed railways since 2008 and plans to top 43,000 miles (70,000 kilometers) by 2035.Meanwhile, the United States has just 375 route-miles of track cleared for operation at more than 100 mph.“Many Americans have no concept of high-speed rail and fail to see its value. They are hopelessly stuck with a highway and airline mindset,” says William C. Vantuono, editor-in-chief of Railway Age, North America’s oldest railroad industry publication.Cars and airliners have dominated long-distance travel in the United States since the 1950s, rapidly usurping a network of luxurious passenger trains with evocative names such as “The Empire Builder,” “Super Chief” and “Silver Comet.”Deserted by Hollywood movie stars and business travelers, famous railroads such as the New York Central were largely bankrupt by the early 1970s, handing over their loss-making trains to Amtrak, the national passenger train operator founded in 1971.In the decades since that traumatic retrenchment, US freight railroads have largely flourished. Passenger rail seems to have been a very low priority for US lawmakers.Powerful airline, oil and auto industry lobbies in Washington have spent millions maintaining that superiority, but their position is weakening in the face of environmental concerns and worsening congestion.US President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill includes an unprecedented $170 billion for improving railroads.Some of this will be invested in repairing Amtrak’s crumbling Northeast Corridor (NEC) linking Boston, New York and Washington.There are also big plans to bring passenger trains back to many more cities across the nation – providing fast, sustainable travel to cities and regions that have not seen a passenger train for decades.Add to this the success of the privately funded Brightline operation in Florida, which has been given the green light to build a $10 billion high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas by 2027, plus schemes in California, Texas and the proposed Cascadia route linking Portland, Oregon, with Seattle and Vancouver, and the United States at last appears to be on the cusp of a passenger rail revolution.“Every president since Ronald Reagan has talked about the pressing need to improve infrastructure across the USA, but they’ve always had other, bigger priorities to deal with,” says Scott Sherin, chief commercial officer of train builder Alstom’s US division.“But now there’s a huge impetus to get things moving – it’s a time of optimism. If we build it, they will come. As an industry, we’re maturing, and we’re ready to take the next step. It’s time to focus on passenger rail.”Sherin points out that other public services such as highways and airports are “massively subsidized,” so there shouldn’t be an issue with doing the same for rail.“We need to do a better job of articulating the benefits of high-speed rail – high-quality jobs, economic stimulus, better connectivity than airlines – and that will help us to build bipartisan support,” he adds. “High-speed rail is not the solution for everything, but it has its place.”Only Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor has trains that can travel at speeds approaching those of the 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph) TGV and Shinkansen.Even here, Amtrak Acela trains currently max out at 150 mph – and only in short bursts. Maximum speeds elsewhere are closer to 100 mph on congested tracks shared with commuter and freight trains.This year, Amtrak plans to introduce its new generation Avelia Liberty trains to replace the life-expired Acelas on the NEC.Capable of reaching 220 mph (although they’ll be limited to 160 mph on the NEC), the trains will bring Alstom’s latest high-speed rail technology to North America.The locomotives at each end – known as power cars – are close relatives of the next generation TGV-M trains, scheduled to debut in France in 2024.Sitting between the power cars are the passenger vehicles, which use Alstom’s Tiltronix technology to run faster through curves by tilting their bodies, much like a MotoGP rider does. And it’s not just travelers who will benefit.“When Amtrak awarded the contract to Alstom in 2015 to 2016, the company had around 200 employees in Hornell,” says Shawn D. Hogan, former mayor of the city of Hornell in New York state.“That figure is now nearer 900, with hiring continuing at a fast pace. I calculate that there has been a total public/private investment of more than $269 million in our city since 2016, including a new hotel, a state-of-the-art hospital and housing developments.“It is a transformative economic development project that is basically unheard of in rural America and if it can happen here, it can happen throughout the United States.”Alstom has spent almost $600 million on building a US supply chain for its high-speed trains – more than 80% of the train is made in the United States, with 170 suppliers across 27 states.“High-speed rail is already here. Avelia Liberty was designed jointly with our European colleagues, so we have what we need for ‘TGV-USA’,” adds Sherin.“It’s all proven tech from existing trains. We’re ready to go when the infrastructure arrives.”And those new lines could arrive sooner than you might think.In March, Brightline confirmed plans to begin construction on a 218-mile (351-kilometer) high-speed line between Rancho Cucamonga, near Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, carving a path through the San Bernardino Mountains and across the desert, following the Interstate 15 corridor.The 200 mph line will slash times to little more than one hour – a massive advantage over the four-hour average by car or five to seven hours by bus – when it opens in 2027.Mike Reininger, CEO of Brightline Holdings, says: “As the most shovel-ready high-speed rail project in the United States, we are one step closer to leveling the playing field against transit and infrastructure projects around the world, and we are proud to be using America’s most skilled workers to get there.”Brightline West expects to inject around $10 billion worth of benefits into the region’s economy, creating about 35,000 construction jobs, as well as 1,000 permanent jobs in maintenance, operations and customer service in Southern California and Nevada.It will also mark the return of passenger trains to Las Vegas after a 30-year hiatus – Amtrak canceled its “Desert Wind” route in 1997.Brightline hopes to attract around 12 million of the 50 million one-way trips taken annually between Las Vegas and LA, 85% of which are taken by bus or car.Meanwhile, construction is progressing on another high-speed line through the San Joaquin Valley.Set to open around 2030, California High Speed Rail (CHSR) will run from Merced to Bakersfield (171 miles) at speeds of up to 220 mph.Coupled with proposed upgrades to commuter rail lines at either end, this project could eventually allow high-speed trains to run the 350 miles (560 kilometers) between Los Angeles to San Francisco metropolitan areas in just two hours and 40 minutes.CHSR has been on the table as far back as 1996, but its implementation has been controversial.Disagreements over the route, management issues, delays in land acquisition and construction, cost over-runs and inadequate funding for completing the entire system have plagued the project – despite the economic benefits it will deliver as well as reducing pollution and congestion. Around 10,000 people are already employed on the project.Costing $63 billion to $98 billion, depending on the final extent of the scheme, CHSR is to connect six of the 10 largest cities in the state and provide the same capacity as 4,200 miles of new highway lanes, 91 additional airport gates and two new airport runways costing between $122 billion and $199 billion.With California’s population expected to grow to more than 45 million by 2050, high-speed rail offers the best value solution to keep the state from grinding to a smoggy halt.Brightline West and CHSR offer templates for the future expansion of high-speed rail in North America.By focusing on pairs of cities or regions that are too close for air travel and too far apart for car drivers, transportation planners can predict which corridors offer the greatest potential.“It’s logical that the US hasn’t yet developed a nationwide high-speed network,” says Sherin. “For decades, traveling by car wasn’t a hardship, but as highway congestion gets worse, we’ve reached a stage where we should start looking more seriously at the alternatives.“The magic numbers are centers of population with around three million people that are 200 to 500 miles apart, giving a trip time of less than three hours – preferably two hours.“Where those conditions apply in Europe and Asia, high-speed rail reduces air’s share of the market from 100% to near zero. The model would work just as well in the USA as it does globally.”Sherin points to the success of the original generation of Acela trains as evidence of this.“When the first generation Acela trains started running between New York City and Washington in 2000, Amtrak attracted so many travelers that the airlines stopped running their frequent ‘shuttles’ between the two cities,” he adds.However, industry observer Vantuono is more pessimistic.“A US high-speed rail network is a pipe dream,” he says. “A lack of political support and federal financial support combined with the kind of fierce landowner opposition that CHSR has faced in California means that the challenges for new high-speed projects are enormous.”According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), urban and high-speed rail hold “major promise to unlock substantial benefits” in reducing global transport emissions.Dr. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, argues that rail transport is “often neglected” in public debates about future transport systems – and this is especially true in North America.“Despite the advent of cars and airplanes, rail of all types has continued to evolve and thrive,” adds Birol.Globally, around three-quarters of rail passenger movements are made on electric-powered vehicles, putting the mode in a unique position to take advantage of the rise in renewable energy over the coming decades.Here, too, the United States lags far behind the rest of the world, with electrification almost unheard of away from the NEC.Rail networks in South Korea, Japan, Europe, China and Russia are more than 60% electrified, according to IEA figures, the highest share of track electrification being South Korea at around 85%.In North America, on the other hand, less than 5% of rail routes are electrified.The enormous size of the United States and its widely dispersed population mitigates against the creation of a single, unified network of the type being built in China and proposed for Europe.Air travel is likely to remain the preferred option for transcontinental journeys that can be more than 3,000 miles (around 4,828 kilometers).But there are many shorter inter-city travel corridors where high-speed rail, or a combination of new infrastructure and upgraded railroad tracks or tilting trains, could eventually provide an unbeatable alternative to air travel and highways.",travel,0.0
264,288,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/50-best-pizza-europe-2023/index.html,Italians judge Spanish pizzeria as the best in Europe – but there’s a catch,2023-05-05 08:10:00,"For years, Italians have been notoriously prickly about preserving their culinary traditions. Pineapple on pizza? Non si fa. Spaghetti bolognese? Che orrore.But now, some Italians seem to be wising up to the fact that other countries can make good Italian food, too.Enter 50 Top Pizza, an international guide run by Italians that produces a series of annual rankings rewarding some of the best pizzerias on the planet. The 2023 European list has just been published – and, according to 1,000 anonymous “inspectors” across the continent, the best pizza in Europe is in… Spain.Sartoria Panatieri, in Barcelona, was judged the best on the continent. The award was announced at a ceremony, which was also held in Barcelona.Second place went to Copenhagen restaurant Bæst, while coming in third was 50 Kalò in London, a spin-off of the original 50 Kalò pizzeria in Naples.There’s a catch of course. Italy was not in competition. The entity – a pizza guide, which has been ranking restaurants since 2017 – has separate listings for the 50 best pizzerias in the cradle of pizza.Sartoria Panatieri is run by Rafa Panatieri and Jorge Sastre. Panatieri grew up in Brazil, but with Italian origins, from Pisa and Calabria. Initially training as a veterinarian, he changed tack to become a chef in South America and Italy, before moving to Spain. He worked in Michelin-starred restaurant Nectari in Barcelona before opening his pizzeria.In a statement, Panatieri said: “We are very proud to have been named the best pizzeria in Europe. This award is a recognition to the dedication that we put every day in Sartoria Panatieri since we opened five years ago with the intention of fulfilling a dream that today we have been able to fulfill thanks to the work of the entire team.”Panatieri also took home the award for Pizza of the Year 2023  with his “Salsa de tomates cherry asados, mozzarella y holandesa de albahaca” wood-fired pizza: tomato sauce, mozzarella, roasted cherry tomatoes and basil hollandaise. The pizza costs €12.90 ($14.20). Pie prices at the restaurant start from $12.Meanwhile, 50 Kalò, which had been awarded first place in previous rankings, has slid down the list in recent years. However, it did take home the award for the “best fried pasta pie” this year.50 Top Pizza has listings for pizzerias across the globe. They’re created by around 1,000 “inspectors” around the world, who first vote for the best places in their own countries, and then make anonymous visits.“For each pizzeria we have several reports of anonymous visits that help us complete the work of ranking,” Barbara Guerra, one of three curators, told CNN. “Basically the ranking is the result of a group work in which we curators are the coordinators. We believe that only the work of a large team can help us make a list that primarily conveys current trends.”Guerra said that Neapolitan style pizza is still the world’s favorite, but that the inspectors aren’t specifically looking for it.They reward “establishments that have personality and consistency, offer great pizza (of any style) and have friendly service,” she said, adding that Sartoria Panatieri and Bæst  are both Neapolitan-inspired but with “a completely different personality.”Guerra said that Italians are rightly proud of their culinary traditions.“Italy is the country of pizza and Naples is the capital of pizza, it is normal that Italians have a lot of pride and strongly defend this product,” she said.“However, every Italian who travels [abroad] can easily realize how much the quality has grown in all European capitals. This is thanks to so many Italian pizza makers in the world but also thanks to people of all nationalities who have learned the art of making pizza in Italy or with Italians. The model is almost always the Neapolitan pizza but then it is expressed in so many ways.”She explained that the rise of real Italian pizza abroad is a relatively recent phenomenon. “Ten years ago in London or Paris you would find so many pizzerias where an Italian would find it hard to identify himself,” Guerra said. “You would see a national product treated very badly. Today this is not the case.”As for the Italy rankings, they will be revealed in Rome on July 12.They’re preceded by the top 50 listings in Asia-Pacific (May 30) and USA (June 27). The big one – worldwide rankings – will be held on September 13 in Naples. The top 25 ranked European pizzerias will go through to the world finals, in which 100 from across the globe will be ranked against each other.So why do we all love pizza? For Guerra, it’s “a food that brings joy, simple and satisfying – and is the only food at an affordable price that’s prepared in front of your eyes.“The real value of pizza, especially Neapolitan pizza, is that it is healthy food with fresh ingredients, freshly prepared at an affordable price,” she added.50 Top Pizza’s top 10 European pizzerias for 20231: Sartoria Panatieri: Barcelona, Spain2: Bæst: Copenhagen, Denmark3: 50 Kalò: London, UK4: Via Toledo Enopizzeria: Vienna, Austria5: Pizza Zulù: Fürth, Germany6: Fratelli Figurato: Madrid, Spain7: Forza: Helsinki, Finland8: Napoli on the Road: London, UK9: nNea: Amsterdam, Netherlands10: La Balmesina: Barcelona, Spain",travel,0.0
265,289,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/bees-delay-delta-flight/index.html,Swarm of bees delays a Delta flight by three hours,2023-05-04 12:29:00,"A swarm of bees touched down on a parked Delta Air Lines aircraft Wednesday, delaying a flight from Houston to Atlanta for about three hours.“Bee-lieve it or not, Delta flight 1682 from Houston-Bush to Atlanta took a delay yesterday afternoon after a friendly group of bees evidently wanted to talk shop with the winglet of our airplanes, no doubt to share the latest about flying conditions at the airport,” the airline said in a playful statement after social media pictures created a buzz.Delta Air Lines did not say exactly what measures were considered to resolve the situation, but ultimately, the bees were displaced by pushing the aircraft back from the gate using ground equipment with no passengers on board.The welfare of the bees and ensuring that aircraft surfaces were not contaminated were factors in the delay.Delta apologized to customers on the delayed flight.Twitter user Anjali Enjeti live tweeted the incident from inside George Bush Intercontinental Airport, reporting on various measures that were evidently floated and rejected to get the bees to take off from their perch on the Airbus A320’s winglet.Enjeti mentions a beekeeper and pest control in her live updates, which were apparently gleaned from Delta announcements and word of mouth from other passengers. She also gave a blow-by-blow of jockeying for position by the airport windows in hopes of witnessing a beekeeping operation, complete with snacks for the show.Alas, no beekeeper appeared, according to Enjeti’s account, much to her disappointment.“Would have a big highlight of my life to see a bee keeper de-bee a plane wing. It’s going to be hard to let go of this. The disappointment is real,” she tweeted.Enjeti did not immediately respond to CNN’s attempt to contact her.Bee swarms on aircraft are rare but not unheard of. A swarm of bees delayed an Air India flight in 2019. Water cannons were used in that case to displace the bees on the aircraft scheduled for a flight from Kolkata to Agartala.In 2016, an F-22 Raptor fighter jet was temporarily grounded by 20,000 bees. A beekeeper helped resolve that situation in Virginia.At passenger airports, beekeepers are becoming increasingly common.A 2022 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine details a number of airports in the United States and internationally that have established “pollinator-friendly practices and programs that restore habitat for bees and bring public awareness and appreciation to these fascinating insects.”According to the report, Hamburg Airport in Germany was the first airport to introduce an on-airport apiary in 1999. Chicago O’Hare was the first US airport to add a major apiary.The Federal Aviation Administration is involved in the research related to airport bee programs.The airport involved in Wednesday’s bee-related delay hasn’t joined in airport beekeeping efforts – yet.“The initiative is being explored for implementation at the Bush Airport campus but currently we do not have a beekeeping program at the airport,” airport spokesperson Augusto Bernal told CNN via email.",travel,0.0
266,290,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/saudi-arabia-lgbt-tourists/index.html,Saudi Arabia says it welcomes LGBTQ visitors,2023-05-05 04:16:00,"As Saudi Arabia continues its drive to attract tourists, authorities in the country appear to be reaching out to a particularly lucrative section of the market: LGBTQ travelers.The website of the Saudi Tourism Authority (STA) seems to have had its Q&A section updated to state that gay visitors are welcome in the kingdom.“Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi Arabia and visitors are not asked to disclose such personal details,” is the website’s response to the question on its FAQ page: “Are LGBT visitors welcome to visit Saudi Arabia?”It is not known exactly when the website was updated. A spokesperson for the STA said the policy had previously been in place, but an archived version of the website on March 14, 2023 and before did not have the question and answer on the page.Same-sex sexual activity is an offense in Saudi Arabia, according to Human Rights Watch.According to the Human Dignity Trust, which campaigns for the rights of LGBT people around the world, trans people can also face prosecution in Saudi, with “substantial evidence of the law being enforced” and “consistent reports of discrimination and violence” against LGBTQ people.LGBTQ+ travelers are a lucrative market, according to Darren Burn, CEO of Out Of Office, a luxury travel planning service for the community, and of Travel Gay, the world’s largest LGBTQ+ travel platform.“Research shows they spend more money in a destination than heterosexual couples, and tend to travel more times a year,” he told CNN.“It’s a very interesting and lucrative demographic, and countries are plowing major revenue into [attracting] it.”Whether LGBTQ travelers will feel comfortable traveling to Saudi, however, is another matter. Burn said that destinations such as the Maldives and Dubai, where homosexuality is a criminal offense, are popular, but without more assurances from the authorities, Saudi Arabia could be a tougher sell.“It’s pretty vague, and doesn’t offer the assurances that would make me feel able to send our clients safely to the destination, but anything on the website about LGBT travelers is a good starting point,” he said.“I can’t think of another Middle Eastern tourist board that has even mentioned them, except Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup, and even that was vague, saying that everyone was welcome.“But my concern is what the reality is like in the destination. Are they saying that a same-sex couple can check into a hotel and get a double bed without any issues? My hunch would be that that’s not the reality.”One gay traveler who visited Saudi Arabia on a work trip in October 2022 – before the website was updated – told CNN that he felt “in the closet” during his stay.The UK traveler – who did not want to be named – spent time in AlUla, one of Saudi’s tourism-focused destinations.“It was OK for a week or so but after that I suddenly realized it gone back to living a life in the closet and not being my true self. More out of fear of what might happen – the unknown – rather than anything specific that happened,” he said.“I was sent an email [by the company I was working for] with what I should do. They basically told me to delete anything even remotely LGBTQI related from my phone – all photos, apps, newspapers and magazines. My Egyptian friend suggested I just get a new clean phone.“I told close colleagues, but I wasn’t [generally] talking about being gay, or my past experience. I kept it to myself, and suddenly realized that I wasn’t able to talk about what I would normally talk about, and that’s not how I want to live. In practice everyone was very relaxed, but the law’s the law.”However, he added that one “revelation” from his trip was “how friendly and welcoming the Saudi people were.“They’re really open to changing attitudes, but they haven’t really [been in contact] with the Western world in their lifetimes. Unless you meet people [from other cultures] and talk about differences there’s no way of learning from them.“I found that what the law and the authorities say is very different to how the locals interact with you.“If you were to go there and be overtly gay I’d be quite concerned – I wouldn’t feel comfortable going there with a partner – but it’s a country that’s changing very quickly.”Saudi Arabia is focusing on expanding its tourism sector, appealing to archaeology fans at the likes of AlUla, where ruins have been left untouched for almost 2,000 years, and creating entire new cities to appeal to visitors.CNN’s Richard Quest, who visited in September 2022, wrote that: “I have seen countries change before, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like the change taking place in Saudi Arabia. Saudi’s change is deliberate, deep-reaching and dramatic.” He also flagged its “contradictions,” however – after his visit, 81 people were executed in a single day.Human rights researcher Nora Noralla told CNN that the kingdom is following Qatar and Dubai in its bid to attract LGBTQ+ travelers. But she warned that it might not be on the travelers’ terms.“In Dubai there are a lot of gay influencers, and as long as you understand the context of the area you’re in and respect the traditional culture and not show your queerness in any way, you’re OK,” she said.“That requires you to be cis-passing. If you show up and you’re non-binary, or male with makeup on, or obviously trans, and come to the region you’ll be denied entrance. I wouldn’t say LGBT people are welcome – they say same-sex couples are welcome, and that’s entirely different.”She also warned that what goes for “rich tourists” doesn’t fly for others. “Queer residents know what lines they can cross, and it’s all down to your economic and social background,” she said. “They realize the risks with this kind of activity and know how to do it in a discreet way. This [the new move] is basically for Western tourists.“They’re trying to copy the Dubai model so they can get some of their money. There’s a lot of competition [for money]. If you’re a cis, gay Westerner you’re welcome. If you’re trans and cis-passing, you’re welcome. But anything that remotely shows your queerness, you’re not. And I think if anyone crosses a line, they will definitely act swiftly.”Despite his skepticism, Darren Burn thinks Saudi could potentially be a gay-friendly destination.“We’d welcome a conversation with the tourist board and government to work out a way that LGBTQ+ travelers can genuinely travel in a safe way, to see them put money behind promoting to LGBT communities, and making changes to LGBT rights locally to make Saudi Arabia an authentic destination that appeals.“We all know the reason destinations are welcoming tourists now is because they think that’s their future income stream, but that’s good, because it might drive changes in equality law if it’s good for business.”He added that travel can broaden minds on both sides.“Without travel and tourists coming to the destinations, mindsets would never change – as long as they can do so safely, LGBTQ+ travelers can break down barriers,” he said.“Destinations do change – but I don’t think we’d be sending customers any time soon until we can receive assurances that they’d be safe, welcome and able to check in.”An STA spokesperson said in a statement: “Everyone is welcome to visit Saudi, provided that they follow and respect our culture, traditions and laws, as you would when you visit any other country in the world.“Like other governments, we do not ask visitors personal questions and we respect the right to privacy.”",travel,0.0
267,291,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/naia-philippines-shuts-airspace-power-outage-intl-hnk/index.html,The Philippines will briefly shut its airspace later this month in a bid to tackle recent airport outages,2023-05-03 02:22:00,"“It’s more fun in the Philippines” is the tourism tagline that draws travelers from around the globe to explore the country’s pristine beaches and lush mountains.But getting there is not always a smooth journey, as anyone unfortunate enough to be at Manila’s airport during two crippling power outages this year discovered.Those outages, on Labor Day and New Year’s Day, caused widespread chaos with hundreds of flight cancellations affecting tens of thousands of passengers.In a bid to solve that issue, the Philippines will close the whole country’s airspace for six hours on May 17 to replace malfunctioning electrical equipment.“It’s the entire Philippine airspace that will be shut down,” Bryan Co, senior assistant general manager at the Manila International Airport Authority, said in a press briefing on Tuesday.The work will replace the uninterruptible power supply for the air traffic management center and the airspace closure will take place between 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. local time, usually a period of lower air traffic, Co added.Co called on airlines to prepare for its airspace going dark by re-arranging their flight schedules and advising passengers on alternative arrangements early on.Built 75 years ago, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL) in Manila – the country’s main international gateway – has been struggling to cope with soaring passenger traffic since flights resumed after pandemic restrictions were lifted.On May 1, the airport’s Terminal 3 suffered an almost nine-hour outage that led to the cancellation of 48 Cebu Pacific’s domestic flights on the Labor Day long weekend holiday.Crowds of unhappy passengers lining up at Cebu Pacific’s counter heckled staff over a lack of clarity on flight arrangements, according to videos from CNN affiliate CNN Philippines.A full electrical analysis is being conducted in the aftermath of the incident and an audit may take up to 90 days to assess which updates need to be prioritized, the airport authority said.Just days before the chaos, a newly-formed Manila International Airport Consortium (MIAC) had made proposals to the national government outlining a series of upgrades at the country’s largest airport, aiming to double annual passenger capacity to 62.5 million by 2028, the group of six conglomerates said in a statement on Thursday.The airport handled 48 million passengers in 2019, despite being designed to handle 31.5 million, it said, and the revamp is expected to cost $1.8 billion (100 billion Philippine pesos).Upgrades had long been overdue especially after tens of thousands of travelers were stranded in the Southeast Asian hub after severe power interruptions impacted air traffic control at the country’s largest airport on New Year’s Day this year. Nearly 300 flights were either delayed, canceled or diverted to other regional airports and at least 56,000 passengers were affected.The Philippine government launched an official investigation into what led to a severe outage on New Year’s Day, which took place during the busy year end travel season that sees large numbers of foreign tourists as well as overseas citizens flying into the country from abroad to mark Christmas and New Year.",travel,0.0
268,292,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/india-worlds-highest-railway-bridge-intl-hnk/index.html,"Taller than the Eiffel Tower, India constructs world’s highest railway bridge in Kashmir",2023-05-02 21:41:00,"India is now home to the world’s tallest railway bridge. Some 29 meters (over 95 feet) taller than the Eiffel Tower, the Chenab Bridge sits 359 meters (around 1,180 feet) above the Chenab River in India’s contentious Jammu and Kashmir region.After decades of construction, the bridge in northern India will be open to visitors by the end of December 2023 or January 2024, the Ministry of Railways said in a March press release.The 1,315 meter-long (4,314 feet) bridge is part of a broader project to make the Kashmir Valley accessible by the Indian Railway network. In addition to the Chenab Bridge, the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) project involves what will become the country’s longest transportation tunnel and Indian Railways’ first cable bridge.For India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who swept to power in 2014 on a ticket of nationalism and a promise of future greatness, investments in infrastructure like the Chenab Bridge and the broader rail link project can be seen as a powerful tool for social integration and political influence, connecting disparate regions with key cities.“The bridge and the greater connectivity it’s meant to create will be projected by New Delhi as another big victory for the region’s development,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center.Linking Kashmir with the rest of India by train will specifically boost the region’s industrial and agricultural sectors by allowing all-weather rail connectivity between the valley and the rest of India, experts say.Previously, the only land route connecting the Indian-controlled parts of Kashmir with the rest of the country was the winding 300-kilometer (185-mile) Srinagar-Jammu national highway, which closes during part of the winter and is also frequently the site of vehicle accidents.“We are getting lot of problems going across the road,” Anil Kumar Mehendru, vice president of the New Kashmir Fruit Association, told CNN. “Once we will be connected by train with the rest of India, it will be a big boost to this industry, agriculture as well as fruit.”Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in India, said the bridge also has political implications, as it’s seen as “a means of integrating Kashmir into India.”According to Singh, “the hope historically” was that the railway link, including the Chenab Bridge, would make Kashmir “feel more as a part of India.”But Singh told CNN it “remains to be seen” whether the expanded connectivity from the bridge and rail link is seen as a positive by Kashmiris, given that “in recent years, Kashmir has been undermined by policies taken by Prime Minister Modi and his government which have really alienated the Kashmiris.”In 2019, India revoked a constitutional provision giving the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir the autonomy to set its own laws. The southern and eastern portions of the region known previously as the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir became two separate union territories, a move Modi claimed would promote stability, reduce corruption and boost the economy.“New Delhi’s message, following that move, was that it would leverage its greater degree of control over Jammu and Kashmir to bring it greater development benefits,” Kugelman said. “It will use the bridge as a high-visibility, eye-catching data point to argue its strategy is working.”Although the overall USBRL project was established in 2002 before Modi became prime minister, the Chenab Bridge is already being touted as a prime example of his efforts to expand development in the country.India’s Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw said in the press release that “The iconic Chenab Bridge is example of such new chapters and dimensions of development materialized by the inspiring leadership of the Honorable Prime Minister.”Since coming to power, Modi increased the budget of less than $100 million for the USBRL project by a factor of six to accelerate the bridge’s completion after years of delays, Vaishnaw told a March press conference, according to CNN affiliate News18.India has invested millions into modernizing its infrastructure. In February, Modi inaugurated the first section of a 1,386-kilometer (861-mile) expressway linking the capital New Delhi to the financial hub of Mumbai. The 246-kilometer section (153-mile) of the expressway alone cost $1.4 billion, the government said in a press release.Construction is also underway for the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, which aims to decongest India’s railway network.",travel,0.0

American and Chinese mountaineers top the list.Spring is the prime time to climb Mount Everest, although some mountaineers might climb in the less favorable autumn season.Most climbers try to ascend the peak in May. There’s a brief window of time – usually after mid-May – when temperatures are warmer, and the high-altitude winds known as the jet stream have moved away from the mountains.The climbers, along with staff members and Sherpa guides, would spend nearly two weeks hiking to the Everest base camp, which sits at an altitude of around 17,000 feet (almost 5,200 meters).They would then spend about two weeks adjusting to the altitude and waiting on good weather conditions before continuing for another four days, reaching other camps and finally ascending to the summit.Mountaineers have warned of the dangers of overcrowding on Everest.Large numbers of people trying to reach the summit during a short time frame have led to traffic jams at the summit in the past, with hundreds of people waiting in line to reach Everest’s top.A picture taken by climber Nirmal Purja showing a dense trail of climbers huddling on an exposed ridge to mountain’s summit in May 2019 went viral. He told CNN at the time that there were roughly 320 people in the queue to the top in an area known as the “death zone.”The more than 460 climbers who have received permission to climb this spring will be accompanied by more than 1,500 Nepali Sherpas and other staff at the base camp and above. To avoid overcrowding, Nepali authorities say they are setting up more than one rope wherever possible.“The geography we can’t change… but we are trying to manage by adding multiple ropes,” Khatiwada told CNN.Three Sherpas died earlier this month after being buried by a block of snow on Everest, according to the official. They were delivering materials to construct and clear a route to be used by climbers to get to the top of the mountain.Nepal is home to eight of the 10 highest mountains in the world, so mountaineering is a significant source of revenue, employing large teams of people to support climbers.",travel,0.0

Guests can book tickets online and use a QR code.Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared at an April 25 ceremony to reveal the new watercraft.“Our endeavor is to provide made-in-India solutions suited to local conditions. Be it semi-high-speed trains, regional rapid transport systems, ferries, (or) ropeways, such systems are being prepared wherever needed,” he said.Modi added that increased connectivity via the new ferries could improve “backwater tourism.”Areas accessible primarily by smaller watercraft are known as backwaters. In Kerala, some can only be reached by hiring a small canoe steered by an experienced local guide. As a result, these rural communities don’t get as many tourists.“Kerala has a lot to offer to the country and the world. I am sure this experiment being done in Kerala will become a model for other states of the country as well,” the prime minister added.Upgrading roads, railways, and metro systems has been a big initiative for the prime minister ahead of the G20, which India will host in September.As it becomes the most populous country in the world, India has made no secret of its tourism ambitions.Indian tourism secretary Arvind Singh has said that his administration plans to create 50 new tourism destinations and 59 flight routes in order to make it easier for visitors to access more parts of the country.Kochi’s water metro system is just the latest in a string of big infrastructure and travel announcements in India.The world’s longest river cruise departed from Varanasi in January, with a 51-day itinerary through multiple Indian states and neighboring Bangladesh.Then, Kolkata’s metro system – the oldest in the country – revealed its first ever underwater line, which travels under the Hooghly River.

The maximum penalty for this offense in Australia is 10 years’ imprisonment.The woman, who was not identified in the statement, appeared before a local court Monday and received bail. The status of her visa and continued stay in Australia is subject to the courts. Depending on the outcome, she could be removed from the country, according to the ABF.ABF Commander Justin Bathurst said the arrest spoke to the diligence of the force’s officers and sophistication of the country’s detection technology.“ABF officers are committed to protecting our community by working with law enforcement partners to prevent items like unregistered firearms getting through at the border,” Bathurst added in the statement.Australia is often held up as an example of how decisive action gun control can succeed in reducing deaths from firearms.The country implemented sweeping gun-control measures after a lone shooter murdered 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in April 1996.Rapid-fire rifles and shotguns were banned, gun owner licensing was tightened and remaining firearms were registered to uniform national standards alongside a hugely successful nationwide buy-back and amnesty scheme.Gun violence has reached record levels in the United States, which is the only nation in the world where civilian firearms outnumber people. In Australia, there are approximately just 14 guns for every 100 people, compared to 120 per 100 in the US, according to the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey (SAS).The US also has more deaths from gun violence than any other developed country per capita. The rate in the US is eight times greater than in Canada, 22 times higher than in the European Union and 23 times greater than in Australia, according to Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) data from 2019.",politics,0.0

The nearest town is about six miles away, and the closest train station is Dumfries, an hour’s bus ride from the town. London and Edinburgh are more than 350 and 100 miles away, respectively.With lush green grass and rocky outcrops stretching to the sea, the island covers an area of about 25 acres, but there are no buildings on it, only a flood pond providing water for livestock and wildlife in the winter months.No one has ever applied for permission to build on the island, according to the listing, so it would be down to the buyer to investigate the development possibilities with the local authority.At low tide, the island can be reached on foot, by tractor or quadbike. As for the rest of the time, there is a pebble beach where boats can be anchored—”the perfect base to explore the island, partake in some cold water swimming…and enjoy a waterside picnic,” Edgar added.It is situated in a Site of Special Scientific Interest—an area in the UK defined as of particular interest due to the rare species of fauna or flora it contains—and is a haven for all types of wildlife, including great black-backed gulls, and rare plants such as rock sea lavender and fragrant orchid.The agent is expecting a lot of interest in this miniature kingdom. “We have witnessed strong demand from domestic and international parties for entire private islands having handled the sale of several in Scotland,” Edgar said.",travel,0.0

We have always said we’d back good projects no matter whose idea it was – this is one of them and it’s what the Sydney Metro project looks like at its best,” Jo Haylen, transport minister for New South Wales, said in a statement.“Having a train travel under our harbor is an exciting and historic first step but more importantly, it means that more people can catch a train through the city and it will improve the broader rail network once the City Metro is ready to take passengers next year.”The $20.5 billion AUD (around $13.7 billion) Metro City and Southwest Line, an extension of Sydney’s Metro Northwest line, will eventually extend all the way to the suburb of Sydenham in the inner west of the city.Although the trains are currently being manually operated during a “low speed” testing period, with a maximum speed of up to 25 kilometers (around 15 miles) per hour, they’ll gradually move into “high-speed testing,” where the maximum speed increases to 110 kilometers (around 68 miles) per hour, according to Peter Regan, CEO of Sydney Metro.The trains will be driverless when they begin operating.“Each train will also undergo acceleration and braking testing on the newly built track and complete a series of system checks to ensure it can perform reliably under operating conditions,” adds Regan.Testing and commissioning will continue throughout the rest of the year, ahead of the commencement of passenger services on the first half of the line, which is scheduled for 2024.The second section of the line, which will run from Sydenham to Bankstown in the south west of Sydney, is not expected to open until 2025.Meanwhile, plans are also in place for a $27 billion AUD (around $18 billion) Metro West line underneath Hunter Street in the Sydney central business district.The city will have a network of four lines, 46 stations and 113 kilometers of new metro rail by 2030.Described as one of the largest suburban rail projects in the world, Sydney’s ambitious project has been compared to Grand Paris Express, the French capital’s estimated $31.6 billion expansion of its public transport network, which is also expected to be complete in 2030.",travel,0.0
275,299,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/exmouth-australia-solar-eclipse-intl-hnk/index.html,How a solar eclipse could change this small Australian town forever,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Thursday’s hybrid solar eclipse will last for 62 seconds. But for a small town in rural northwest Australia, the effects could linger on for a lifetime.That’s the hope for Exmouth and the surrounding Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia, which are hoping that April 20th’s once-in-a-decade natural phenomenon could kick off a tourism boom that lasts well beyond the eclipse.“They’re pretty intimidated but also very excited,” Roger Cook, Deputy Premier of Western Australia state, tells CNN about the residents of Exmouth.The town – whose name is pronounced “ex-mowth” – has 3,000 residents but will swell to 20,000 this week, based on accommodation bookings and information from the local tourism authority.Exmouth will have possibly the world’s best view of the April 20 solar event.There will be a partial view of the eclipse beginning at 10:04 a.m. local time, then the totality – where the sun appears completely blocked out from the sky – will occur at 11:29 a.m. The partial view then ends at 1:02 p.m.At the moment of totality, the sun, earth and moon will all align to awe-inspiring effect.The Ningaloo area has been working on its eclipse-related tourism offerings for more than a year, according to Cook.There’s a range of events to keep newfound friends busy, including outdoor music performances, stargazing tours, photography lessons and astronomy education programs for kids.On top of that, the local Baiyungu community,  the traditional owners of the land, have organized the first-ever Jamba Nyinayi Festival.Held in nearby Coral Bay, the festival includes Indigenous storytelling, music, dance, food and fire and ends with a drone show on Thursday night.Exmouth is some 1,250 km (777 miles) north of Western Australia’s capital, Perth, and is geographically closer to Papua New Guinea than Sydney or Melbourne.But now that a swell of hopeful stargazers is coming to see the eclipse, local tourism officials are hoping that these guests will fall in love with the area, then go home and tell their friends and family about it.And there’s some evidence of the region’s growing prominence on the international stage: CNN Travel selected Western Australia for our list of the best places to visit in 2023.One of the area’s biggest draws is the UNESCO-listed Ningaloo Coast, a 604,500-hectare stretch known for an exceptional coral reef as well as for being the home of whale sharks and sea turtles.Additional park rangers have been brought in to support the wave of new visitors. Altogether, Western Australia state spent 20 million AUD ($13.5 million) on infrastructure updates for the eclipse, which included everything from water and sanitation services to additional parking.Local residents may be antsy about their big moment in the sun (or, briefly out of the sun), but Cook points out how many opportunities could come in the months and years beyond the solar eclipse.“They see it as a great opportunity to showcase their town and the environment in which they live, and the great tourism opportunity it might present not just people who come this week but people who are watching from around the world.”",world,0.0
276,300,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/best-rice-dishes-world/index.html,Best rice dishes: 20 delicious specialties from around the world,2023-05-04 08:52:00,"With thousands of varieties of rice in the world – jasmine, basmati, arborio and Carolina Gold, to name just a few – is it any surprise the grain defines iconic meals everywhere from Singapore to South Carolina?Plus, half the world’s population relies on rice as a staple, so there have been plenty of culinary innovators over its long history.And while famous rice dishes such as sushi, fried rice and paella are among the most prominent in the global spotlight, there are so many more rice recipes out there to put on your radar – and seek out on your travels.Here are 20 dishes from international crowd-pleasers to some that you may not have tasted – yet:Widely enjoyed in West African countries for special occasions such as weddings, birthdays and funerals, jollof is a one-pot rice dish made by cooking rice, onions, tomatoes, meat and spices in a single vessel.“Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria argue over who makes the best jollof, but it really comes down to who’s cooking it,” says Sierra Leonean fashion designer Mary Ann Kai Kai of Madam wokie.Typical Ghanaian jollof incorporates more spices than Nigerian jollof and also usually uses an aromatic rice, such as basmati, instead of the long grain rice more typical in Nigerian jollof. But jollof recipes can vary within the same country, too.The dish is said to have originated in Senegal, but the debate over who makes the best jollof on the continent and across the diaspora will never end.Found in various iterations all over China, zongzi refers to sticky, glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves before boiling that can be stuffed with savory or sweet fillings.And while anything that is wrapped with a skin and has a stuffing is considered a dumpling, says Nadia Liu Spellman, author of “Dumpling Daughter: Heirloom Recipes from our Restaurants and Home Kitchens,” the Chinese put zongzi is a category of its own.Typical zongzi fillings in southern China include salted duck egg and pork belly while sweeter fillings such as red bean paste and tapioca are more common in the north of the country.“Every family recipe has their own secrets that they believe make their zongzi superior,” Spellman says.A stovetop staple at many a German oma’s house, milchreis (translation: milk rice), is a creamy rice pudding made from arborio, medium or long grain white rice that’s sweetened with cinnamon and sugar and splashed with vanilla extract.It can be enjoyed warm, straight from the stovetop, or chilled. It’s a nostalgic childhood snack that’s often enjoyed by adults across Germany, too. You can even buy pre-made containers of milchreis in the refrigerated sections of German grocery stores.Far from the only country to concoct a sweet treat featuring rice and milk, German milchreis is joined by Lebanese meghli, Indian kheer, Portuguese arroz doce, Latin American arroz con leche and many, many more in the rice pudding family.A gift to global gastronomy, Spain’s main rice player is paella, the famous dish from Valencia that originated as a peasant food and is typically made using bomba rice, which maintains its firmness while absorbing the broth while cooking.The dish was originally invented in rural areas and made use of whatever ingredients were available, including rice, chicken, rabbit and snails mixed with saffron, olive oil and the vegetables of the season, says Patricia Palacios of Spain travel website, España Guide.“Today, there are many different paella recipes,” she told CNN Travel. “Along the coast, fish and seafood paellas are very popular. Vegetarian paellas are also common. But most Spaniards would agree that a big no-no with paellas is mixing meat and fish/seafood.”Making Italy’s most famous rice dish is an art form that requires near constant stirring on the part of the cook. And any Italian will tell you risotto must be “all’onda” (translation: on the wave) – with a texture that undulates enough to fall off the spoon without ever taking on the dreaded globby consistency.With its high starch content, arborio rice is most commonly used in making the dish, typically served as a first course in Italy.“Risotto is comfort food,” says Calabria-born cookbook author Francesca Montillo, who leads culinary tours in Italy. “It’s not necessarily an easy dish to prepare, so it also speaks to the skills of the chef or home cook preparing it.”The traditional preparation, Montillo says, involves first toasting the rice then adding wine as it cooks in the broth, with butter and grated cheese added later. Variations include adding peas, mushrooms, asparagus and ham, among other ingredients.Sicily’s most famous street food is the rice ball whose name comes from the orange citrus fruit it resembles in shape and color. Arancini is essentially stuffed rice balls that are breaded and fried, says Montillo. And Sicilians debate the dish’s name.“In Palermo, it’s typically round and the name is arancina,” she says. “In Catania, it’s cone-shaped, some say to resemble the local Etna volcano, and it’s called arancino.”You can find the dish all over Sicily as well as on mainland Italy, but arancini are particularly linked to Siracusa’s Festa di Santa Lucia (Feast Day of St. Lucia), celebrated every year on December 13. The balls are usually stuffed with meat sauce, says Montillo, and other fillings might include peas, mozzarella, prosciutto, spinach and eggplant in tomato sauce (“alla Norma”).Beloved across the Indian subcontinent and said to have originated in Iran (birinj biriyan means “fried rice” in Persian), biryani is almost always on the menu for special occasions in India, says cookbook author Vasanti Bhadkamkar-Balan.“It is a rich and elaborate preparation, made by layering partially cooked basmati rice with vegetables/lamb/chicken/fish in a sauce that is flavored with exotic spices and aromatics,” she said.The pot is then covered and sealed with dough or a wet cloth that stops the steam from escaping while the biryani cooks over a low flame. Typical biryani spices include a wide aromatic mix, among them fennel seeds, mace, cardamom, bay leaves, coriander and garlic.Afghanistan’s most famous rice dish, Kabuli pulao is a pilaf-style specialty. Served in many countries, rice pilaf is a loose-grain dish often cooked in stock with spices, onions and other ingredients.Kabuli pulao is served piled high atop a platter and redolent with slow-cooked lamb and a blend of spices (cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon and cumin among them), mixed with a long grain rice such as basmati.The dish is usually topped with julienned carrots, raisins and toasted almonds. Kabuli pulao takes its name from the Afghani capital, Kabul, but is also enjoyed in neighboring Pakistan.Sushi’s popularity precedes it. But just as dear to the Japanese is onigiri, a staple bento box snack made from steamed Japanese rice shaped into a triangular form and wrapped with the seaweed called nori.“Despite its integral significance in Japanese culture, it is still an uncommon novelty in the United States, even in a metropolis such as New York,” says Ricky Dolinsky, co-owner and chef at New York City cocktail bar Paper Planes, which has styles of onigiri on its speakeasy menu.Onigiri is special, he says, because of its convenience and affordability. “Onigiri reigns supreme in Japan,” says Dolinsky. “Whether it’s a quick grab-and-go on the way to work, or prepared at home for a lunch bento box.”Nasi goreng translates to “fried rice” in the Indonesian and Malay languages and is an inexpensive and filling comfort staple served at street stalls and restaurants across the Indonesian archipelago, everywhere from Jakarta’s markets and Bali’s backpacker hangouts to the streets of Sumatra.Mixing sweet and salty flavors, the dish is made from long grain rice flavored with a spice blend called bumbu (with shrimp paste, ginger, candlenut and other ingredients) and the sweet Indonesian soy sauce called kecap manis.Variations of nasi goreng, which is considered a comfort food in Indonesia, incorporate eggs, shrimp and chicken. It’s often enjoyed with a side of spicy sambal sauce.Fans of crispy rice will enjoy this Persian specialty typically made with basmati rice, yogurt, saffron and sometimes an egg yolk. Tahdig means “bottom of the pot,” referring to the dish’s crispy golden bottom of cooked rice that pairs perfectly with its fluffy interior.Cooking fat on the bottom of the rice pan helps ensure the tahdig gets pan-fried below while cooking, while staying light and steamy up top. Saffron threads give it its golden glow.Said to have been a favorite of Queen Victoria, the Anglo-Indian dish called kedgeree traces its roots to the far more ancient spiced lentil Indian dish, khichiri, which dates to the 14th century.A popular British comfort food today, kedgeree blends smoked haddock filet with basmati rice, hard boiled eggs and spices such as cumin, coriander and turmeric (the fish and eggs reflect the taste preferences of the British Raj, who appropriated khichiri to their palates).One of Cuba’s classic comfort rice dishes, arroz imperial is prepared for special occasions on the island and among the diaspora in Miami and elsewhere, too. It’s assembled in layers, much in the same way as lasagna.Satisfying enough to be served as a main dish, it’s typically layered with yellow rice, shredded chicken, mayonnaise (to help bind it and for flavor) and cheese and is sometimes baked before serving for a melted effect. Olives, tomatoes and peppers are popular additions.A one-pot comfort food ubiquitous in the dual-island Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, pelau is an everyday dish best shared with friends and family, says Jeanine Prime, the owner of Trinidadian restaurant Cane in Washington, DC.To make it, she says, rice, peas and animal proteins (usually chicken) are caramelized and then cooked with stock, coconut milk and spices. The dish is often the centerpiece at social gatherings on the islands because it’s so filling.“People eat it while hanging out at the beach, while taking in a cricket match, or even at dinner parties,” says Prime, who was born and raised in Trinidad. “It is to Trinidadians what jollof is to Ghanaians and Nigerians.”Also called Cajun dirty rice, this Louisiana classic preferably made from long grain rice from the marshes of southern Louisiana is enjoyed across the state – from the tables of home cooks in Lake Charles and Baton Rouge to cafeteria-style diners and upscale restaurants in New Orleans.It’s as typical a side dish in these parts as mashed potatoes are elsewhere in the country. In traditional recipes, chopped chicken livers or gizzards give the white rice its “dirty” color.Not to be mistaken for the popular Creole dish, jambalaya, dirty rice can also be made using ground beef and ground pork (if you don’t like innards) to give the rice its distinctive look.Wali wa kukaanga is Kenya’s answer to fried rice, and translates to just that in Swahili.Served alongside a meat dish or all on its own, it’s a straightforward meal that’s easy to prepare from common ingredients and consists of boiled rice fried together in oil with turmeric and a mix of chopped vegetables that might include onions, carrots, peas and corn.Carolina Gold Rice is the preferred grain for preparing chicken perloo (also called perlo or purloo), a quintessential South Carolina Lowcountry dish that traces its roots to West Africa and the slave trade.With similarities to paella and jollof, the dish consists of a protein simmered with rice, tomatoes, onion, garlic, celery, bell peppers and spices.“Perloo’s importance – as with so much regional cuisine throughout the South – is that it reflects the blending of cultures from Africa and Europe that make this dish so unique to the South Carolina Lowcountry,” said Kiawah Island Golf Resort executive chef, John Ondo, in an email to CNN Travel.The dish varies depending on where you are in the Lowcountry, he said, with less tomato used farther north.“Gullah and Geechee cooks who make Perloo stick to tradition, passing these family recipes down from generation to generation,” he says. “The result is that there are as many subtle variations for Perloo recipes as there are cooks and ways to spell it.”Coconut figures big in the cuisine of tropical Samoa, from coconut rolls and bread to coconut cookies and meat and vegetable dishes that incorporate the milk.So it’s no surprise that the Polynesian island country’s most popular rice dish, alaisa fa’apopo, has ties to the coconut, too. A popular savory snack, it’s made from coconut cream mixed with steamy salted rice and is often served with coffee or a cup of koko Samoa (Samoan hot chocolate).This wildly popular Korean dish whose name translates to “mixed rice” has gained fame around the globe and consists of rice served in a bowl and topped with a colorful array of individually prepared meats and artfully sliced vegetables.The city of Jeonju in western South Korea, where the rice is cooked in a broth made from beef brisket, is the most famous place to try it. The dish is often served with the Korean hot chili condiment called Yak-gochujang.When it comes to fried rice, the Chinese version tends to steal the spotlight. But Thai fried rice, called khao pad, is just as worthy of acclaim and a similar staple at home tables (not to mention from street food vendors) in the southeast Asian country.Hom mali –Thai jasmine rice that’s considered the “Champagne of rice” – serves as the base for the dish, says Thailand-born chef Vanda Asapahu of Los Angeles restaurant Ayara Thai.“Layering of flavors is important in Thai food and extends to its fried rice,” she says, noting the importance of balancing salty and sweet. “You also need a hot wok and good eggs, and for sure white pepper and scallions to finish off the dish, all of which are basic essentials in a Thai kitchen.”",travel,0.0

Flip through a Thai cook book, and you’ll be hard pressed to find an ingredient list that doesn’t run a page long.The combination of so many herbs and spices in each dish produces complex flavors that somehow come together like orchestral music. Thais fit spicy, sour, salty, sweet, chewy, crunchy and slippery into one dish.With influences from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar and a royal culinary tradition, Thai cuisine is the best of many worlds. The best part about eating Thai food in Thailand, though, is the hospitality. Sun, beach, service with a smile and a plastic bag full of som tam – that’s the good life.YumTom yam kung: a rave party for the mouth.

Filling but one-dimensional.When a cuisine uses spices in such abundance that the meat and vegetables seem like an afterthought, you know you’re dealing with cooks dedicated to flavor.In Indian cuisine, there are no rules for spice usage as long as it results in something delicious. The same spice can add zest to savory and sweet dishes or can sometimes be eaten on its own. For instance, fennel seed is enjoyed as a breath-freshening digestive aid at the end of meals.And any country that manages to make vegetarian food taste consistently great certainly deserves some kind of Nobel prize. The regional varieties are vast.

All that bar-hopping and tapas-eating, the 9 p.m. dinners, the endless porron challenges – this is a culture based on, around and sometimes even inside food.Spanish cuisine is made with the same unbridled passion you find in the flamenco dance. The people munch on snacks throughout the day with intervals of big meals.

278,302,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chicken-vanilla-cream-sauce-eva-longoria-wellness-origseriesfilms/index.html,This savory Mexican dish made with vanilla is a first for Eva Longoria,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Vanilla is frequently added to desserts, but in Mexico, where the plant originates, uses for the spice are limitless — working its way into savory main dishes.Norma Gaya’s family has been harvesting vanilla for a long time. The Gaya Vai-Mex vanilla plantation in Gutiérrez Zamora, in the eastern state of Veracruz, is the oldest in the region.Indigenous people first harvested the beans from Vanilla planifolia, a tropical orchid native to Veracruz, along the Gulf of Mexico. When Aztecs conquered the region, they taxed the Totonacs in the form of the prized vanilla. Following the Spanish invasion in 1519, vanilla was imported to Europe and became one of the most sought-after spices.Growing the pods is labor-intensive, making vanilla second only to saffron when it comes to the priciest spices.Gaya is the first woman to take charge of her family’s vanilla business, which was established in 1873.“The first day, I had to drink a lot with the vanilla producers, so they would accept me,” Gaya told Budget Travel in 2007.In her kitchen, Gaya adds surprisingly versatile vanilla to everything, enhancing the flavor of salad dressing, coffee, pasta — and even chicken.Gaya’s great-grandfather created the family’s signature vanilla chicken recipe, which calls for a creamy, buttery sauce.She made the heirloom dish for actor, producer and TV host Eva Longoria, who calls herself “probably the biggest fan of vanilla,” in an episode of the CNN Original Series “Eva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.”In this specialty, the chicken is cooked in a sauce that contains 4 tablespoons — that’s an entire ¼ cup — of pure vanilla extract. Then, the meat is topped with black vanilla seeds scraped from the vanilla bean.“It’s like caviar — you’ve gotta be very sparing with it,” Longoria said of the vanilla seeds.Gaya calls it black gold.“I’ve never had chicken with vanilla,” Longoria said as she helped Gaya prepare the meal.“Oh, my God. Everybody has to eat this when we’re done (shooting),” Longoria told the crew as she tried the vanilla chicken for the first time.Whole vanilla beans can be found online and at specialty grocery stores.Makes 4 to 6 servings2.2 pounds I 1 kilogram boneless, skinless chicken thighs and legs, chopped into large pieces½ cup | 118 milliliters apple cider vinegarSalt and freshly ground pepper to taste6½ tablespoons I 90 grams unsalted butter, divided2½ cups | 125 grams white onion, diced2 cups | 473 milliliters heavy whipping cream2 cups | 473 milliliters whole milk¼ cup | 60 milliliters vanilla extract1½ tablespoons | 10 grams ground allspiceVanilla bean (optional)Warm tortillas for serving1.

Blend well until smooth.3. In a saucepan, sauté the chicken over medium heat with remaining scant 3 tablespoons (or 40 grams) butter and add the creamy onion mixture and allspice. Simmer chicken until cooked through, about 30 minutes. (The internal meat temperature should be 165 degrees Fahrenheit or 74 degrees Celsius).4.

279,303,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/japan-haneda-airport-garden-hnk-intl/index.html,Watch planes take off in Japan — from an onsen,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Visitors staying at Tokyo Haneda International Airport’s newly opened hotel can enjoy plane-spotting and views of Mount Fuji – all from a rooftop hot spring.Opened last December, the Hotel Villa Fontaine Premier & Grand Haneda Airport has 1,717 rooms and is directly connected to Haneda International Airport Terminal 3. Along with its in-house spa equipped with an indoor and outdoor natural hot spring, it offers everything from an event hall and kid-friendly suites to a gym and restaurants.What makes it unique, according to its developers, is that it’s also part of Haneda Airport Garden, a multipurpose commercial facility and bus terminal built by Japanese real estate company Sumitomo Realty Group.Dubbed a “city where people gather and live,” the complex has some 74 stores spread across two floors that bring together tax-free foods and souvenirs from all four corners of Japan.Here, visitors can pick up everything from chopsticks crafted from broken baseball bats to sweets decorated with Japanese ukiyoe prints after sampling Japanese delicacies in a food hall themed after Japan’s Edo period from 1603 to 1868.While tourism to Japan was at a standstill for more than two years following the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, overseas visitor numbers have steadily climbed since the government resumed visa-free travel for many countries last October.In March, the number of foreign business and leisure visitors climbed to its highest post-pandemic level, around 1.82 million, up from 1.48 million in February, according to data from the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO).Tokyo has also announced plans to receive up to 60 million overseas visitors to the country by 2030. The ambitious goal comes as the government expects visitor numbers to continue rising ahead of upcoming international events such as Expo 25 in Osaka in 2025.And as inbound tourism recovers, Haneda – which has been crowned the world’s most punctual mega-airport – hopes to ride that wave.Ultimately, developers hope their new hotel and airport complex will come to represent a microcosm of Japan’s regional crafts and flavors for overseas travelers and local day trip visitors searching for some rest and relaxation.Currently, those eager to leave the airport can catch a ride from the bus terminal on one of 30 different routes connecting visitors to destinations such as Osaka, Sendai and Hakuba, a ski resort town in Nagano Prefecture.Developers want to expand those routes to greater swathes of Japan as part of broader plans to help revitalize the country’s regions, according to Katsuyuki Tou, general manager of the Haneda Airport Garden.Tou explained that visitors to the multipurpose complex can already get a taste of what Japan offers. For example, they can sample matcha lattes from a green tea shop with a 90-year history or see handmade Japanese craft umbrellas.Next up, developers want to include immersive elements in the visitor experience.“In the future, we’d like visitors to be able to do more than just purchasing or looking at items. For instance, we’d like them to be able to take part in experiences like traditional green tea or sweets-making workshops that spark their curiosity and desire to visit other regions of Japan,” he added.“We aim to help support the revitalization of tourism to Japan, with the Haneda Airport Garden acting as the starting and end point for visitors.”Haneda Airport Garden is directly connected to by train to the Keihin Electric Express Railway Airport Line and is a one-minute walk from Tokyo Monorail Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Station.It is also directly connected from the second floor of Haneda Airport’s Terminal 3.",travel,0.0
280,304,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/oryx-hotel-hamad-international-airport-doha/index.html,Inside one of the world’s most luxurious airport transit hotels,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Need help finding the hotel within Doha’s airport? Look for the 23-foot-tall teddy bear made out of bronze and hang a right at the Hermes store.Passengers transiting through Hamad International Airport in Qatar’s capital can choose to leave the airport and join a free tour of some of the capital’s most famous attractions, including Souq Waqif and the Golden Masjid.But others can opt to book a room at the Oryx, a Qatar Airlines-owned hotel conveniently located near the C,D, and E gates.As a swanky hotel in a swanky airport that regularly ranks at the top of the annual Skytrax list of the world’s best, it’s no stretch to say this could be one of the planet’s most luxurious transit hotels.If you can locate it.Because the oryx – a kind of antelope native to the Middle East – is the logo of Qatar Airways, the name is in use all over the airport, sometimes to confusing effect.Case in point: The Oryx lounge is just one floor (second) below the Oryx hotel (third), which means that a staff member is employed to hang out in the hotel lobby to run interference for lost travelers.To check in, passengers will need to show their passport and boarding pass. Doha is a “quiet airport,” which means that there are no oral announcements about boarding gates and passengers are expected to use screens or phone apps to figure out where to go. They’ll also have to part with upwards of about US$450 per stay – significantly more expensive than a typical night’s accommodation in Doha.Front desk staff at the hotel are efficient and helpful. As only transit passengers are staying there, reception will double and triple-check passengers’ itineraries and offer a wake-up call to make sure they’re awake in time to make their next flight.“Hamad International Airport operates as a  24-hours, seven-days-a-week facility and therefore all the different passenger touchpoints follow the same timeline,” says Badr Mohammed Al Meer, chief operating officer for the airport.“We are constantly striving to offer the best and bespoke experiences for travelers, including our airport hotel offering. We want to provide them with an unmatched experience with a luxurious appeal, which is synonymous across the airport as a whole.”The Oryx is the only hotel within the airport itself, making it a logical choice for those with shorter layovers (by law, transit stays in the airport must be less than 24 hours). And there are also ways to experience the hotel without booking a room.Travelers may access the Oryx’s “vitality center” at a cost of 175 riyals ($48) per person for up to four hours.This wellness-centric area, one floor above the rooms, has a squash court, golf simulator, spa and hydrotherapy pools and hot tubs in addition to a swimming pool.The narrow 25-meter (82-feet) long pool looks like it is encased in a glass jewel box.Silver geometric designs are a major motif around the airport, and that continues to the pool, whose blue water shimmers against the light coming in from the lattice shape of the metal walls and ceiling.Although there are some dress codes around public beaches in Qatar, the hotel is privately owned – meaning that guests can wear western swimwear. They can also order a poolside cocktail, as alcohol is permitted here as well.Unlike the hotel, which is open 24 hours a day, the vitality center closes from 2-6 a.m. Access to these areas is gratis for hotel guests, although you still have to pay for spa treatments.The treatments are designed specifically for travelers, like a massage for weary feet and a facial that addresses the dryness caused by recycled airplane air.Thanks to Doha’s role as a major global transit hub, some guests find themselves returning to the Oryx on repeat visits.One of those is Jane Jones, a Canadian travel agent who recently spent a 12-hour layover sleeping and swimming at the Oryx. It was her second time there – the first time, she had a shorter layover and opted for a pool and gym pass.Jones, who was en route to a holiday in Thailand this January, says the hotel’s amenities are “top notch.”“One thing I particularly appreciated was the convenience,” she said. “I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room.”Her personal highlights were the speedy free Wi-Fi, which enabled her to get some work done before her flight and the wide variety of options – namely weight training and cardio – in the gym.“I would definitely do it again,” she adds.There are 100 rooms at the hotel, all spread out along one floor.Considering that an average of 40 million people pass through Hamad International Airport per year, there is high demand for rooms at the Oryx.Booking in advance is highly recommended. People whose plans have changed or are dealing with last-minute cancellations can come to the reception area and stand in a long line to try and get a room, but those who have pre-booked can skip ahead and check in with ease.The rooms themselves at the Oryx are light and airy. The walls are simple and cream-colored with the occasional burst of red or gold, while bed linens and towels are crisp, clean white. Overall, the design scheme creates a feeling of lightness.There are four main room types – superior (with one king bed), deluxe (one king bed and one twin), family (three beds), and executive suites (one king bed, but more floor space), as well as a posh presidential suite complete with a private lounge and powder room.Amenities make the rooms comfortable for a rest and recharge.Each room has a kettle for coffee and tea making purposes, two complimentary bottles of water, and a large rainforest shower – just the thing for a rejuvenation between flights.The other usual hotel amenities are there too: clothes hangers, an iron, a hair dryer, bathrobes, and slippers. In the bathroom, built-in shampoo dispensers and disposable toothbrushes mean you may not even need to take anything out of your own suitcase in order to freshen up.In-room power points are international, and there are also USB ports.And despite the airy, open feeling in the rooms and common spaces, there’s one critical area where things feel heavy: window coverings.For people in desperate need of shuteye, the Oryx’s bedrooms can be made extremely dark despite the presence of Doha’s brilliant sunshine outside. And a good night’s – or afternoon’s – sleep may be the ultimate luxury of all.",travel,0.0

The most luxurious of the group is the 68th-floor penthouse suite, which the hotel bills as both the largest and highest presidential suite in all of Vietnam.The 488-square-meter suite has two marble bathrooms, sleeping space for up to five people as well as a private chef and mixologist on request. Every single room, not limited to the suites, has floor-to-ceiling glass windows to allow for maximum enjoyment of the surroundings.Meanwhile, the hotel’s Oriental Pearl restaurant takes phở, the noodle soup that is arguably the country’s most famous dish – and makes it more upscale by using wagyu beef.At the appropriately-named cafe The Cloud, traditional Vietnamese coffees and locally-made chocolates are on offer.There are three event spaces at the Vinpearl. All three have outdoor terrace areas, and one of them is big enough to drive a car into, according to the hotel.In addition, there’s a spa named Akoya, after a traditional Vietnamese pearl that symbolizes beauty. While there, visitors have the option to indulge in a spa treatment like a massage or facial or to spend time in the sauna, steam room or infinity pool.“We look forward to elevating the level of hospitality for local and international business and leisure travelers in this vibrant Vietnamese metropolis,” the Vinpearl’s general manager, Goetz Bauer, said in a statement.He added: “We hope to become a new beacon of light on the skyline, fostering meaningful connections between our cherished guests and the quintessential spirit of this compelling city.”The hotel – which is the Vietnam debut of Marriott’s Autograph Collection brand – occupies 34 floors of the 81-floor skyscraper.The rest of Landmark 81 is a mix of private residences and public attractions. Guests can visit the ice skating rink, movie theater, kids’ play area and shopping mall all without leaving the building, as well as pay a visit to the 81st-floor observation deck.The building’s design was inspired by a Vietnamese legend in which a three-year-old boy named Thanh Giong was able to fight off an enemy using only a bundle of bamboo.Vinpearl Landmark 81 is located about 11 km (7 miles) from Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Vietnam’s biggest and busiest airport.Vinpearl Landmark 81,  720A Đ.

282,306,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/couple-turned-abandoned-japanese-home-into-guest-house/index.html,Couple transforms abandoned Japanese home into guesthouse,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","He’d spent years backpacking around the world, and Japanese traveler Daisuke Kajiyama was finally ready to return home to pursue his long-held dream of opening up a guesthouse.In 2011, Kajiyama arrived back in Japan with his Israeli partner Hila, who he met in Nepal, and the pair set about finding the perfect location for their future venture.However, there were a couple of major stumbling blocks in their way. To start with, Kajiyama had very little money to speak of after years of globetrotting around destinations like Korea, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Guatemala, Cuba and Canada.He also happened to have his heart set on a traditional Japanese house, typically known as kominka, which are usually passed down over generations.“I wanted to have a traditional house in the countryside,” Kajiyama tells CNN Travel, explaining that he was determined to find two houses located next to each other, so that he and Hila could live in one, while the other would be a guesthouse that they’d run together. “I had a vision.”When he was unable to find anything that met his requirements, Kajiyama decided to shift his search to include the growing number of abandoned homes in the country.As younger people ditch rural areas in pursuit of jobs in the city, Japan’s countryside is becoming filled with “ghost” houses, or “akiya.”According to the Japan Policy Forum, there were 61 million houses and 52 million households in Japan in 2013, and with the country’s population expected to decline from 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, this number is likely to increase.Kajiyama was driving around Tamatori, a small village located in the Shizuoka prefecture, between Kyoto and Tokyo, surrounded by green tea plantations and rice fields, when he came across an elderly woman farming, and decided to approach her.“I said ‘Do you know if there are any empty houses around here?’ And she just pointed,” he recalls.He looked over at the area that she was signaling to and spotted two neglected houses side by side – a former green tea factory and an old farmer’s home – located close to a river.Both properties had been uninhabited for at least seven years and needed a huge amount of work. Kajiyama asked the woman to contact the owner to find out if they’d be interested in selling.“The owner said that no one could live there, as it was abandoned,” he says. “But he didn’t say ‘no.’ Everybody was always saying ‘no.’ But he didn’t. So I felt there was a small chance.”Kajiyama returned to visit the houses around five times, before going to visit the owner himself to negotiate an agreement that would see him use the old green tree factory as a home, and convert the farmer’s house into the guesthouse he’d always envisioned.While he was keen to purchase both of the homes, he explains that the traditions around home ownership in Japan mean that he is unable to do so until it’s passed down to the son of the current owner.“They said ‘if you take all the responsibility yourself, you can take it.’ So we made an agreement on paper,” he says.Both he and Hila were aware that they had a lot of work ahead of them, but the couple, who married in 2013, were thrilled to be one step closer to having their own guesthouse in an ideal spot.“It’s a very nice location,” says Kajiyama. “It’s close to the city, but it’s really countryside. Also people still live here and go to work [in the city].“The house is also in front of the river, so when you go to sleep you can hear the sound of the water.”According to Kajiyama, the process of clearing the house, which is around 90 years old, before beginning the renovation works was one of the hardest parts of the process, simply because there was so much stuff to sort through. However, he was able to repurpose some of the items.During the first year, he spent a lot of time connecting with locals, gaining knowledge about the home, and helping the local farmers with farming for the first year or so.Although he wasn’t hugely experienced with renovation work, he had spent some time farming and completing building while he was backpacking, and had also taken odd jobs fixing peoples homes.He completed much of the work on the guesthouse himself, replacing the floors and adding in a toilet, which he says was a wedding present from his parents, at a cost of around $10,000.“I’m not really a professional,” he says.” I like to do carpentry and I enjoy creating things, but I have no experience in my background.“From my several years of backpacking, I saw so many interesting buildings, so many houses of interesting shapes and I’ve been collecting those in my brain.”Kajiyama was determined to keep the house as authentic as possible by using traditional materials.He saved money by collecting traditional wood from building companies who were in the process of breaking down traditional houses.“They need to spend the money to throw it away,” he explains. “But for me, some of the stuff is like treasure. So I would go and take the material that I wanted.“The house is a very, very old style,” he says. “So it wouldn’t look nice if I brought in more modern materials. It’s totally authentic.”He explains that very little work had previously been done to the house, which is quite unusual for a home built so many years ago.“It’s totally authentic,” he says. “Usually, with traditional houses, some renovations are made to the walls, because the insulation is not so strong. So you lose the style.”He says he received some financial support from the government, which meant he was able to bring in a carpenter and also benefited from Japan’s working holiday program, which allows travelers to work in exchange for food and board, when he needed extra help.After doing some research into Japanese guesthouse permits, he discovered that one of the simplest ways to acquire one would be to register the property as an agriculture guesthouse.As the area is filled with bamboo forests, this seemed like a no-brainer, and Kajiyama decided to learn everything he could about bamboo farming so that he could combine the two businesses.“This is how I started farming,” he says.In 2014, two years after they began working on the house, the couple were finally able to welcome their first guests.“It was a beautiful feeling,” says Kajiyama. “Of course, this was my dream. But people really appreciate that it was abandoned and I brought it back to life.”He says that hosting guests from all over the world has helped him to stay connected to his former life as a backpacker.“I stay in one place, but people come to me and I feel like I’m traveling,” he says. “Today, it’s Australia, tomorrow it’s the UK and next week South Africa and India.“People come from different places and they invite me to join them for dinner, so sometimes I join someone’s family life.”Sadly, Hila passed away from cancer in 2022. Kajiyama stresses that his beloved wife played a huge part in helping him achieve his dream of having a guesthouse and says he couldn’t have done it without her.“We were really together,” he adds. “She created this place with me. Without her it would not have been like this.”While the three-bedroom guesthouse, which measures around 80 square meters, has been open for around eight years, Kajiyama is still working on it, and says he has no idea when he’ll be finished.“It’s never ending,” he admits. “I’m halfway, I feel. It is beautiful already. But it started off abandoned, so it needs more details. And I’m getting better at creating, so I need time to do it.”He explains that he’s unable to complete work on the home while guests are there. And while the property is closed during the winter, he spends two months as a bamboo farmer and usually spends a month traveling, which doesn’t leave him much time for renovations.“Sometimes I don’t do anything,” he admits.Yui Valley, which offers activities such as bamboo weaving workshops, has helped to bring many travelers to the village of Tamatori over the years.“Most of the guests come after Tokyo, and it’s such a contrast,” he says. “They are really happy to share the nature and the tradition in our house.“Most people have dreamed of coming to Japan for a long time and they have a very short time here.“So they have such a beautiful energy. I’m happy to host in this way and join their holiday time. It’s very special [for me].”Kajiyama estimates that he’s spent around $40,000 on the renovation work so far, and if the feedback from guests, and locals, is anything to go by, it seems to have been money well spent.“People appreciate what I’ve done,” he adds. “So that makes me feel special.”As for Hiroko, the woman who pointed out the house to him over a decade ago, Kajiyama says she’s stunned at the transformation, and is amazed at how many international travelers are coming to Tamatori to stay at Yui Valley.“She cannot believe how much more beautiful it is [now],” he says. “She didn’t think it was going to be like this. So she really appreciates it. She says ‘thank you’ a lot.”Yui Valley, 1170 Okabecho Tamatori, Fujieda, Shizuoka 421-1101, Japan",travel,0.0
283,307,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-hiking-cancer/index.html,They met while hiking and fell in love. Two months later she was diagnosed with cancer,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Patricia Salazar first saw Aaron Toro running along the breathtaking Peekaboo Trail in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah.Patricia was also tackling the trail, alongside two friendly women she’d just met. The July sun was blazing down and the surrounding copper rocks were bathed in a warm light.The Peekaboo Trail is one of the most strenuous in Bryce Canyon. Patricia’s a hardcore runner and extreme sports enthusiast, but even she was finding it tough-going – so the fact that Aaron was running up the mountain like it was nothing was pretty impressive. Patricia couldn’t help but comment on his speed.“Are you trying to be the fastest on the trail?” Patricia shouted at the stranger as he whizzed past.Aaron stopped running, caught his breath, and smiled at Patricia. He brushed off the compliment, said a friendly hello, and offered to take a photo of Patricia and her new friends. The women thanked him, then he was off again, running into the distance. Patricia watched him go.“I’m like, ‘Oh my God, he looks like a Hemsworth brother.’ He was tan and buff, with blond hair. And so I was like, ‘Gosh, what a hunk. That’ll be a good story for later.’”Patricia assumed she’d never see the runner again. But then, mere minutes later, she spotted him on another bend in the trail.“The girls were like, ‘Oh, my God, there he is, there he is.’ And again, I had nothing to lose, nothing to gain – at least so I thought. And so I just hollered at him, ‘Hey, are you single?’”Aaron stopped, turned around, and grinned.“Yeah,” he said. “Single as a one dollar bill.”“At that point, in my mind I was like, ‘Oh, no, what’s my follow-up?’” recalls Patricia.“Do you want my number?” Patricia asked Aaron, spontaneously.“Are you from here?” said Aaron in response.“No,” replied Patricia. “Does it matter?”“No, I guess not,” shrugged Aaron.And so they exchanged names and numbers. Patricia told Aaron she was from California, and in town for a vacation. Aaron said he was based in Virginia at the time.Patricia saved Aaron in her cell phone as “Trail Aaron.”“I said, ‘Okay, I’ll text you,’” recalls Patricia. “Never thinking that I would hear from him or we would connect. And he went on his merry way and kept running.”It was the summer of 2021. Patricia was 31 and enjoying what felt like a gradual return to “normal” following the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I was single, living by myself, and I had been an endurance athlete for a few years,” Patricia tells CNN Travel today.Patricia had never had much luck with dating apps. And meeting people in person in the Covid era felt pretty much impossible. That summer, she was feeling excited about the future and the opportunity to pursue her goals and dreams alone.“I was just going to be the single endurance athlete. I loved cycling, I loved running, and that was just going to fulfill me enough, and that was great,” she says.Patricia had also made a pact with herself: Each year, she’d take a solo trip somewhere to escape from the pressures of work and indulge her hobbies and passions. In summer 2021, with international travel still largely off the table, Patricia picked Utah as her destination. The state was home to some beautiful national parks, perfect for trail running. That July, Patricia drove to Utah from her home in California.“That’s kind of where I was in life, just exploring on my own and being so happy to be in the driver’s seat – not only of my road trip, but of my life,” she says.When he met Patricia, Aaron was in his late twenties. Like Patricia, Aaron was in a place in his life where he was focusing on himself, rather than dating. He was in the middle of a contract with the US Navy and had found being active-duty military didn’t lend itself to meeting prospective partners.“We’re constantly traveling and moving and you’re all over the place all the time,” says Aaron.He spent his down time enjoying endurance sports.“I started training really hard. And I would devote all my time, essentially, to that – and I was okay with that,” he recalls.In July 2021, Aaron was in his home state of Utah to catch up with his parents and sisters and to enjoy some quality time with loved ones before he started his next deployment.“Going out to Utah, a week before I leave the country for six months – the last thing on my mind was meeting someone,” he says.But Aaron was smitten with Patricia from the moment she’d unexpectedly hollered at him on the trail. He was delighted when she asked for his number.“I left thinking, ‘Wow, she’s spectacular. Probably never hear from her ever again in my life.’ Because, you know, stuff like this doesn’t happen. So I’m like, ‘Oh, well, that was nice of her. But she’s probably just goofing with her friends. And I’ll probably never see her again.’”Aaron kept running around Bryce Canyon, and eventually reunited with his family, who’d opted for a more leisurely hike. But as the group were leaving the park, Aaron saw Patricia again – now on her own, having bid farewell to the women she met earlier. Patricia said hi to Aaron and his family as she ran past.“One sec, I’ll catch up with you,” Aaron told his parents, and, without really thinking, he decided to try to speak with Patricia again.When he caught up with her – not easy, says Aaron, she’s super fast – Aaron asked if Patricia would like to walk the last half-mile together.“We started talking,” recalls Aaron, “And it was a really good conversation. We both happened to be training for similar races at the same time. Obviously, she seems really cool. She’s way out of my league, so I was pretty surprised she was talking to me.”Over the course of the conversation, Patricia and Aaron discovered they were both keen to run one of Bryce Canyon’s most famous trails – the beautiful Fairyland Loop – and agreed to meet the following morning to give it a go together.“I felt like he could really be the adventure buddy I never thought I needed, but after meeting him, knew I wanted,” says Patricia.From there, Patricia and Aaron went their separate ways. Patricia cycled back to her Airbnb, where she showered, put her feet up, and was just wondering where she could go for a drink and a bite to eat, when a text from “Trail Aaron” popped up on her phone.Aaron and his family were hanging out at his uncle’s house that evening. He wondering if Patricia fancied joining for brisket?“At that point, I’d eaten bar food and Clif bars for about a week and a half on the roads, I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, home-cooked meal, for sure,” recalls Patricia.“That actually sounds amazing,” Patricia typed in response. “Count me in!”When Aaron sent the invite, he just figured he had “nothing to lose.” He really liked Patricia, and when she said she was up for coming round, he was thrilled.He put down his phone and tracked down his family, who were preparing food in his uncle’s kitchen.“Hey guys, so you know that girl in the green shorts that ran by earlier? Well, she’s coming over,” he said.“Wait, do you even know her?” asked his family, confused.But Patricia fit in right away. It was like she and Aaron had known one another for years, not for mere hours.“I spent the whole night just meeting his family and playing pickleball and cornhole,” says Patricia. “I think his family was a little shocked, but it was an awesome night.”“They’re great people,” says Aaron. “So they were more than welcoming.”“When I got to the house and started talking to his family, I was like, ‘Oh, man, he checks all the dream boxes – comes from an amazing family, is in between two girls, has two sisters, his mom is his best friend, loves to hike, loves to bike…’” says Patricia.Hours later, Patricia and Aaron were sitting out in the backyard together, chatting.“He reached over and he held my hand,” recalls Patricia. “The moment he held my hand, I knew I was going to fall in love with him.”Aaron felt the same way.“There’s just something about her, she was so gorgeous. We had so much fun just hanging out, we connected on so many levels and we were just best friends right off the bat,” he says.“And I don’t know why, but something just clicked in my brain that day and that night where it was like – she’s worth the risk. Seeing how she interacted with my family… Like I said, it was just like, ‘Wow, there’s something special here.’”The next day, Aaron and Patricia ran the Fairyland Loop together. From there, Patricia was planning to head to Utah’s Park City to tackle more trails. She asked Aaron if he wanted to join her.It was only then, when they were in the car en route, that Aaron mentioned he was in the military and was heading off on a six-month deployment in twelve days’ time.When Aaron met potential partners, he never led with the fact he was in active service – he knew it wasn’t always an attractive prospect, given the inevitable long distance.Patricia had never met anyone in the military. She wasn’t sure what to think. But she knew Aaron made her feel safe and excited for the future. She decided this news didn’t change anything.When they stopped for gas, Patricia texted her best friend, “I met the man I’m going to marry on a trail,” she said.“No you didn’t,” replied her friend.“We drove for hours together, we’re staying in an Airbnb together,” said Patricia.For her friend, this message was less exciting and more terrifying, setting off several alarm bells.“Okay, well you need to send me your location,” she wrote back. “We’ve all heard this story before on whatever news network.”After concluding her Utah trip, Patricia was planning to drive back to California, visiting family en route. Knowing that Aaron would be leaving the country within days, she decided to take a leap.“Hey, I don’t want to waste any time,” she said. “Why don’t we just go together, and you can meet my family?”Aaron said sure – she’d already met his family, after all – so Patricia rang her mom to tell her she was bringing along a plus one.“I met this guy on a trail, I really like him,” she said. “I think this is it.”“Wait, who is he?” asked Patricia’s mother, confused.“I think I’m falling in love,” said Patricia. “This is crazy.”En route to Patricia’s parents’ house, Patricia and Aaron stopped over in Salt Lake City. They stayed up into the early hours, talking.“It was the night in Salt Lake that we decided to really go all in,” says Patricia. “We had a lot of serious conversations right off the bat – where we were financially, what our aspirations were, where we were politically, what our relationships with our family were like, and what we really wanted out of life if we were going to have another serious relationship.”Aaron says it was clear the two were aligned, and also ready to meet each other where they were at.“We were both very much on our own path, and we were both taking our lives and our careers very seriously,” he says. “So we just laid that all out on the table for each other. We both said, ‘If I do a relationship again, it’s for real, it’s not just dating around for fun.’”Their talks were sometimes “heavy,” he adds.“I think we were both at that same mental place, and we were both mature enough to just put that all out on the table.”The two came up with a “five-year plan right off the bat,” as Aaron puts it. He knew he didn’t want to stay in the military indefinitely, for example, and both he and Patricia were keen to get married, but liked the idea of an elopement over a big wedding.They’d covered almost everything when Patricia suddenly realized she’d forgotten to check just how long Aaron’s deployment would last.He explained it would be six months, and he’d mostly be stationed in Spain.Patricia had been expecting something way longer, and way further afield. Six months seemed doable.“Let’s do this thing,” she said.The two became official there and then.“We had a pretty good foundation of what to expect out of each other, out of our relationship and out of our lives. So the rest was easy after that,” says Aaron.“With that small hiccup in the middle,” says Patricia. “That whole cancer thing.”For the first few months, Patricia and Aaron found long distance relatively easy. They FaceTimed every day, enjoying more long, deep chats. Within weeks, they told one another they were falling in love. Patricia booked a trip to Spain for September. Their leap of faith back in July seemed to be paying off.“It was really manageable – we felt very lucky how successfully we navigated long distance,” says Patricia.Then fall came, and Patricia had an abnormal pap smear result. She didn’t think too much about it. She went on the planned trip to visit Aaron in Spain. Back in the US, Patricia’s doctor booked her in for a colposcopy. She kept Aaron in the loop.“I wasn’t worried about it,” says Patricia. “I think in the back of his mind, he was a little more worried than I was.”Then the results came through: Patricia had stage two cervical cancer.She wanted to tell Aaron the news on FaceTime rather than via text. By then, he was based somewhere in Africa.“I remember just waiting up late that night for him to wake up to tell him,” says Patricia.She was in a state of shock. How could she tell this man she was falling for more and more each day, who was currently hundreds of miles away across oceans, that she had a crushing diagnosis and uncertain future?“I sat in the living room, and FaceTimed him, and I said, ‘This is my diagnosis,” recalls Patricia.In one of their deep conversations in Salt Lake City, both Patricia and Aaron had expressed a desire to have kids. Now, Patricia’s doctor had said it was unlikely she’d be able to have biological children. And the journey to recovery was set to be long, complicated and uncertain.“If this isn’t the path that you want to walk on with me, I completely understand,” Patricia told Aaron that night. “I love you, you love me. And so it’s been fun, but I’m not going to make that choice for you.”Aaron jumped in right away.“No, I want you forever more than I want anything else,” he said.“I wanted to reach through the phone, ‘What are you talking about?’” recalls Aaron today. “We’re in this for the long-haul, no matter what, cancer’s not going to get in the way of that, it’s just one more thing.”So Aaron said all the right things, and did his best to comfort Patricia from afar. But he was horribly aware of the distance. And the creeping fear.“There’s nothing I could do other than just try to comfort her through a phone,” he says today.Over the next few months, Patricia had another biopsy, to determine the cancer hadn’t spread, and started fertility treatment, as she still hoped to have biological children one day. Aaron supported her throughout and was always there, even if he couldn’t be physically there.“He was there every day for me and, I kid you not, there were nights that I cried myself to sleep with him on the phone, on FaceTime,” says Patricia.“I hated to Google what the doctors were sending me and so he would Google for me and be like, ‘Don’t Google that.’”Things “got worse before it got better,” as Aaron puts it.At first, it seemed like a dose of radiation could target Patricia’s cancer. Then doctors started discussing surgery and concluded Patricia needed a hysterectomy. This would be an invasive procedure with significant recovery time.Aaron was granted emergency leave to go home to the US to support Patricia in person in the weeks before, during and after the surgery. He’s eternally grateful for this.In late 2021, Covid-related rules still restricted Californian hospital visitors. But whenever he was permitted to be in the building, Aaron was by Patricia’s side.“That was a huge, I guess, strength-builder in our relationship,” says Patricia of this period. “I didn’t know if we could get stronger than we already were. And then that happened.”While Patricia was in hospital, Aaron met Patricia’s grandparents, who she’s very close with, for the first time. Patricia’s grandmother immediately took Aaron aside.“Her grandma takes me into the other room. And she gives me Trisha’s great-grandma’s engagement ring, which is a family heirloom ring,” recalls Aaron. “She’s like, ‘This is for when you ask Trish to marry her.’”Aaron remembers sitting in his car in the hospital parking lot, turning the beautiful ring over in his hands.“I had the family ring, and I was literally just sitting there for hours outside the hospital in the rain,” he says, getting emotional at the memory. “I knew as soon as she came out of hospital that I was going to ask her to marry me.”On Christmas Eve 2021, Aaron proposed to Patricia.“I was laying on the couch. We were in matching Christmas onesies,” recalls Patricia. “And on Christmas Eve, my family usually lets us open one Christmas present. So I said, ‘Let’s keep that tradition going, let’s open one Christmas present.’”She gave Aaron a pair of slippers. Then he got down on one knee and asked her to marry him, presenting her with the family ring.“I could barely move, nine days after my surgery. But I jumped up off of that couch so fast to say yes,” recalls Patricia. “It was very exciting, and our families were so thrilled for us.”Over the first half of 2022, Patricia continued to recover from surgery and went through five weeks of radiation.“I knew there was a finish line and Aaron would be waiting at it, so I took it day by day,” she says.Then, in September 2022, Patricia and Aaron got married. As they’d always planned, they eloped. The ceremony took place amid the red rocks in Snow Canyon, Utah, not far from where their relationship first began.“It was exactly what we wanted,” says Patricia, who took Aaron’s name, becoming Patricia Toro. “We left out of our vows, ‘through sickness and health,’ because we’ve already gone through that, we know we can accomplish that.”Fast forward to today, and Aaron’s finishing up his final navy deployment and Patricia’s in remission. The couple are looking forward to the future.“The sky’s the limit. We’re not 100% sure where we’re going to end up but we have a few plans in place, and it’s all looking up from here,” says Aaron.It’s not even two years ago that Patricia and Aaron first met, but the two feel like they’ve crammed a lifetime of ups and downs into their relationship so far.It’s surreal to think about, especially when they consider the slim chances of them meeting in the first place.“It doesn’t feel real, it feels like we’re living in a simulation, because it’s just ridiculous,” says Aaron. “We live on opposite coasts, we both happen to be in Utah, in the same National Park, same day.”“I am not a super-religious person, and neither is Aaron. But we both feel that there was something that put us on that trail that day,” says Patricia. “And I don’t know if that something knew the struggles that I was going to go through three months later. Or if they knew that he’s going to need me in his life at one point. But we were there for a reason that day. And I know that my journey these last 17 months would have been a lot different had Aaron not been there.”",travel,0.0
284,308,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-school-reunion-vacation-romance/index.html,"They dated as teenagers. 40 years later, she decided to go on vacation with him","09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Bo Knapp never forgot the first moment he first saw Beverly Scott. It was August 1968, day one of eighth grade and Beverly was a transfer student at Henderson Junior High in Little Rock, Arkansas. Bo and his best friend were standing in the school hallway when they met Beverly.“Our hallways in this school, they were outside, and so there’s this beam of sunlight shining down on her,” recalls Bo. “She had a Black Watch plaid dress on, and she had really beautiful red hair, and she’s standing there and she saw us coming, and she turned and smiled.”Bo had only moved to Little Rock the year before, so he and Beverly bonded over both being new in town. And it turned out Bo and Beverly lived just half a mile from each other. A friendship between the two 14-year-olds quickly developed.“We got to know each other, and we started going steady,” Beverly tells CNN Travel.As a sign of their commitment, Bo gave Beverly an ID bracelet with his name on and she never took it off. And over the next couple of months, they had a sweet, brief courtship. After curfew, Bo would sneak into Beverly’s yard to steal a few extra moments with her.“I’d say, ‘Come to my window and I’ll talk to you through the window,’” recalls Beverly.“One day, it was like 10 o’clock at night and I wanted to talk to her, so I went around and knocked on her window, and her dad caught me,” recalls Bo. “That might have been the end.”The relationship dwindled from there, but Bo and Beverly remained friends throughout junior high. Bo’s best friend even dated Beverly for two years (“very long for that time period,” adds Bo.)“Then we went our separate ways,” recalls Beverly. “But we always knew how each other was getting on, and who they were dating – we went on to go to the same high school and college.”But after university, the two lost touch completely. Beverly stayed in Arkansas and got married. Bo lived all over – from Texas to Tokyo – before settling in South Carolina and also getting married.Years, then decades passed. By the mid-2000s, Bo and Beverly were back on the peripheries of one another’s lives thanks to social media. But they lived hundreds of miles from one another, and were both dealing with some tough circumstances – Bo went through a divorce, while Beverly’s husband passed away.Cut to 2013. Bo had been divorced for almost a decade and Beverly was a widow of three years. The former flames, now both 60, received invites to their 40th high school reunion, taking place at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock.Both Bo and Beverly had attended previous school reunions, but with their partners in tow, and they’d never talked much to one another. This time round, they were each attending alone, and over the course of the evening, they found themselves often in one another’s orbit. They didn’t talk much one-on-one, but were often in the same group conversations.At some point in the evening, Bo told Beverly and his other former classmates about his love of sailing – he’d recently got his license and enjoyed getting out on the water whenever he could.His old friends were enraptured by Bo’s sailing stories and a plan started developing – Bo would charter a large catamaran so the old school gang could head out on a 40th anniversary sailing trip.That night, Bo recalls thinking Beverly was “fun and beautiful,” just like he recalled her being back in the day. He was excited that she seemed interested in the sailing trip, but he didn’t think anything romantic would happen between them.“I always had a favorable impression of her – and asked her on the trip as a friend,” he says.As for Beverly, when she told her friends and family she was going on vacation with a bunch of people she hadn’t hung out with since she was 17, they were skeptical.“They thought I was crazy,” she recalls.But Beverly was excited about the trip.“I’m pretty adventurous,” she says. “Love all things on the water! And I felt very secure and comfortable going with such great people I had known most all my life, even though I had not seen or kept in close contact with them.”Her only concern was that the group might not have the same camaraderie they’d had as teenagers. But she needn’t have worried, the trip was great fun from day one.As the catamaran sailed around the Caribbean, stopping off at sandy beaches and ocean view restaurants, Bo and Beverly found themselves increasingly drawn to one another.“Nothing really happened on the trip,” says Bo. “Except I noticed she was perfect: cheerful, self reliant, capable, fearless.”“We had a chemistry – that was kind of undeniable, honestly,” says Beverly. But at the time, she wasn’t sure if she was ready to date again – whenever friends back home suggested setting her up, she’d always bow out. She was nervous about the idea, and hated the idea of dating feeling forced.One evening, the catamaran stopped off at Bomba’s Shack on Tortola, a spot in the British Virgin Islands known for its surfing and partying scene.It was “literally a shack of driftwood and washed up lumber slapped together haphazardly on a remote beach,” recalls Bo.When Bo and Beverly’s group arrived, a full moon party was in full swing, a live band playing and revelers drinking, dancing and celebrating.The old friends stayed out into the early hours of the morning. Then something unexpected happened.“We were dancing and he kind of kissed me,” recalls Beverly. “We call it the ‘accidental kiss.’”It was, says Beverly, “very unexpected, short and sweet and made my heart skip a beat or two.”The next day Bo sent Beverly an email, apologizing. “I’m sorry about the kiss,” he wrote. “I didn’t mean for that to happen. But I might like another one.”When the message popped up on Beverly’s phone, she didn’t know what to do – she felt the same way, but she didn’t want to risk making things awkward by disrupting the group dynamic on the ship. Beverly decided to ignore the message, pretending she hadn’t seen it under the guise of not checking her inbox on vacation.But when the sailing trip came to an end and Beverly and Bo returned to their home towns some 600 miles apart, Beverly finally replied. From there, the two started messaging back and forth.These emails got deep quickly, as Bo got frank about his views on life, travel and everything in between. He was curious to learn more about Beverly, “to see if we were aligned,” as he puts it.It was soon obvious they were.“Beverly said she lived by putting energy and focus on five Fs: Faith, Family, Friends, Fun, Fitness,” says Bo. “These were exactly my priorities as well.”In one of his emails, Bo wrote that he’d never thought about getting married again, but he was starting to consider the prospect.“Why don’t we have a date before we talk about the rest of our lives?” wrote Beverly in response.Bo arranged to travel to Little Rock to meet Beverly for a lunch date. Somehow, Beverly’s mother, uncle, sister, brother-in-law and niece ended up inviting themselves along – and then Beverly’s adult kids found out and wanted to come too. All Beverly’s family members were keen to suss Bo out, and no one wanted to miss the occasion.That morning, Beverly picked Bo up from the airport and filled him in on the extra attendees.“So we might want to stop by the Capital Hotel bar and have a quick drink before we go,” she told him.Lunch was a baptism of fire, a “first date with like 10 people,” as Bo puts it. But Beverly’s family were fun and welcoming, and quickly assured of Bo’s good intentions.“He was thrown into the whole family pretty quickly,” says Beverly.As for Beverly’s friends, they were initially a bit concerned, especially when Beverly started talking about moving to North Carolina to be with Bo.“They’d become pretty protective of me because of being a widow in the group and all of my friends’ husbands kind of took me under their wings,” says Beverly.But once Beverly’s core group met Bo, and decided he was a good guy, they were happy and excited for her.“Now they’re all good friends,” says Beverly.Bo was initially worried his best friend, the one who’d dated Beverly after he did, back in the late 1960s, might not take the news so well. But this friend, while joking that Beverly had broken his heart back in the day, said he was delighted for his old pals and their unexpected happiness.In fact, all the old middle school crew were “thrilled that we both found each other and were so well suited,” says Bo.After they had their loved ones blessings, Bo and Beverly became serious quickly.“When you know, you know,” says Beverly.Plus, after losing her first husband, Beverly was keenly aware of how fickle and how short life can be. She didn’t want to waste a moment – and Bo was on the same page.“We were like, ‘We’ve got to get this show on the road, we don’t have much time,’” says Beverly. “So we’ve made the most out of every single second.”Travel became a cornerstone of Bo and Beverly’s relationship. Their first trip together as a couple was to watch the Rolling Stones play a gig in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.And then in 2015, on a trip to Paris, Bo proposed to Beverly at the top of the Eiffel Tower.They were on the top level, by the cafe, and had just spotted some hired photographers taking pictures of the visitors, framed against the panoramic views.“I said, ‘Let’s get our photo taken,’” recalls Bo. “So I went and grabbed a photographer, and the photographer came, and then I kneeled.”“I said, ‘Bo, they’re taking our picture, get up! What are you doing down there?’” recalls Beverly, laughing.But once she realized what was happening, Beverly said yes, overjoyed.The two started planning a wedding, looking at how they could bring all their family together for the occasion, but they soon switched gears.“We finally look at each other and go, ‘Let’s just do something for ourselves.’ We came back and had a big party – but we decided to just run away and get married,” says Beverly.The couple eloped on Turtle Island in Fiji. It’s a day that Beverly remembers as simply “really cool.”Since then, Bo and Beverly have embarked on at least one cycling trip and one sailing trip each year, often with various groups of friends in tow. They also love traveling with their kids and grandkids.“We want to do as much as possible while we are still able,” says Bo.“Beverly is 10 times more adventurous than the average person so she makes our lives so exciting,” he adds. “At our age a lot of our friends are content to sit on the couch. She has too much life force in her to sit still.”Today, looking back on their middle school romance, their decades apart and their unexpected reunion is a moving and gratifying experience for Bo and Beverly.Beverly thinks their 14-year-old selves “would be so happy for us and proud of us.”“We both have gone through so much and have such a deep appreciation and love for each other and our life together,” says Beverly, adding she’s so grateful to have had “two soulmates in my lifetime, which is unheard of.”This summer, Bo and Beverly will be heading to their 50th high school reunion. This time, they’ll be rocking up hand in hand.“It seems like yesterday we graduated high school,” says Bo. “Life flies, it doesn’t seem like it sometimes, especially when you’re younger – but don’t waste time. Don’t worry about the little stuff and enjoy every moment. If you wake up, it’s a good day, right?”“Enjoy every moment,” agrees Beverly. “We are.”",travel,0.0
285,309,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-reunited-cousins/index.html,She met her long lost cousin on a cruise ship,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","When Eileen Monaghan’s cousin Nora died in 2014, Eileen grieved not only the loss of a beloved older relative but also her last link to Ireland.Eileen’s grandmother emigrated from the tiny village of Shalvey, in Donegal, Ireland in the late 1800s. Growing up in the US, young Eileen loved hearing her grandmother’s stories of Ireland and became fascinated by her Irish roots.Today, Eileen and her husband Gerard are travel-loving retirees – they’ve visited all seven continents and explored some 65 countries – but for Eileen, no country will ever top Ireland.On past Irish trips, Eileen and Gerard would always make a pilgrimage to Eileen’s grandmother’s old house. Then they’d pop round to cousin Nora’s for a cup of tea and a catch up.“She’d be charming, delightful and wonderful,” Eileen recalls.Eileen only found out Nora had passed away when an unopened Christmas card was returned across the Atlantic, the sobering word “deceased” scribbled on the envelope.As Eileen and Gerard mourned their Irish relative, they were saddened by the realization that next time they found their way to Shalvey, there’d be no one ready with the kettle on.The following year, 2015, Eileen celebrated her 70th birthday with a voyage on board Cunard’s Queen Elizabeth cruise ship.“We wanted to go through the Panama Canal, so we did the Queen Elizabeth down the coast and outside of Costa Rica,” says Eileen.One evening, midway through the trip, Eileen was getting ready for dinner in her cabin, while Gerard was in the elevator, traveling from the seventh to ninth floor. As the elevator made its way up the ship, Gerard tuned into a conversation playing out between the couple standing next to him.They sounded Irish, which intrigued Gerard. He loves speaking with people on his travels, and finds accents fascinating, so he decided to initiate conversation.“Lovely lilt,” he commented. “Where are you from?”“From the North, County Derry,” said the man.“Oh that’s next door to Donegal,” said Gerard, adding that he’d spent some time in Ireland. “My wife’s family is from Shalvey.”His elevator companion looked surprised.“I had a cousin in Shalvey, but she died last year,” he said.Gerard stared at him, disbelievingly. What were the chances? But yet the similarities were striking, and tiny Shalvey’s population numbered no more than 15 people.“Nora?” he asked.“Nora,” replied the man, his eyes widening.The elevator doors opened and the occupants got out, looking at one another in disbelief.The Irish couple introduced themselves as Paddy and Hazel McEvoy. In turn, Gerard gave his name and Eileen’s. It dawned on them all that Eileen and Paddy were distant relatives who’d never met, but were about to be unexpectedly reunited on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean.The group arranged to reconvene for a post-dinner drink, with Gerard adding that Eileen was celebrating a significant birthday.“My wife was just saying how it was a shame she didn’t have any family on board to celebrate with,” he said. “Now she does.”With that, Gerard rushed back to the cabin to tell Eileen.“We’re going to meet your cousin,” he told her, hardly believing the words as they came out of his mouth.Eileen couldn’t believe it either. She was in shock when she met Paddy at the cruise bar. He welcomed her with an enveloping hug and friendly smile.“I don’t believe this is happening,” Eileen recalls thinking.The unexpected family reunion turned into an hours-long conversation about family, nationality and everything in between.“By the time we got through talking about all the relatives on both sides, it was time to go home,” jokes Paddy. “But we did squeeze in a few words about travels here and there.”“We’ve both done a lot of traveling in our time,” adds his wife Hazel. “We compared stories of travels around the world.”For the remaining two weeks of the cruise, the two long lost cousins and their spouses were inseparable.“We met every day on the cruise after that, and got to know each other,” recalls Hazel. “We had drinks before and after dinner every night.”At the time, the foursome were all in their 60s and 70s and there was, as Paddy puts it, “an awful lot of water under the bridge” to fill in.It turned out both couples had sons living in Boston. They all, especially Paddy and Gerard, enjoy debating history, religion and politics. All four love travel. Already plans started brewing for future family get-togethers.When the cruise ended, the McEvoys and the Monaghans exchanged contact details, promising to stay in touch.Paddy and Hazel happened to be heading to the US later that year to visit their son. When, in one of many post-cruise email exchanges, they mentioned the upcoming trip to Eileen and Gerard, the Americans immediately invited their Irish relatives to visit them in Connecticut.Paddy remembers his American daughter-in-law being especially wary about the whole situation.“How do you know these people? I feel like they’re about to take you to their basement, never to be seen again,” he recalls her saying, only half-jokingly.As such, it was pretty hilarious when Paddy and Hazel arrived at Eileen and Gerard’s Connecticut home only to be enthusiastically shown around the American couple’s basement conversion.But the visit went off without a hitch, and the connection made on the cruise seemed only more solid on the ground.Eileen and Gerard returned the visit later in the year. It was so special for Eileen to once again be welcomed by an Irish cousin, cup of tea in hand.From there, as Hazel puts it, “a great friendship developed.”“We’ve been friends ever since and we visit across the Atlantic regularly now to see one another,” she says.There have been adventures in Ireland, trips to Eileen and Gerard’s second home in Vermont and group vacations – and their Boston-based sons enjoy meeting up too.Eileen has also met a whole host of other Irish family members through Paddy. She tells him today that he “brightened her future” by opening a door she’d thought forever closed following Nora’s passing.Today, the cousins like to imagine Nora “laughing her head off” at the idea of Eileen and Gerard meeting and becoming close thanks to the unlikely combination of a cruise ship, an elevator and an overheard conversation.Due to the pandemic, it’s been almost four years since the McEvoys and the Monaghans have met in person, but the two couples are set to finally reunite this summer.They’re counting down the days, and in the meantime the foursome have stayed in touch via lively video call and long emails.Last year, Eileen’s brother passed away, and she says Paddy and Hazel’s letters and emails “helped so much” during that tough period.“It really means the world that we’ve met these people, how lucky we are to meet them,” says Eileen.Hazel summarizes their story with the following words: “fun and friendship and family.”“I’ll go with those three and add ‘fascinating’,” says Gerard.Over the years, Eileen and Paddy have analyzed their family trees more than a few times, trying to work out exactly what their relationship is – they’re connected through marriage, and through their respective grandmothers.“I think it makes us fifth cousins or something,” guesses Eileen.“Oh no,” says Paddy. “We’re much more than that.

286,310,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html,A short history of the long fight over breakfast tacos,"09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos.In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of habañero-hot debate.A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue.But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico.The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate.There’s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN “Searching for Mexico” series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León.There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Doña Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.“The breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it’s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,” narrates Longoria.CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel – born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years – to find out more.“When I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.”Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as “a really fast food, but not a junkie food.”Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo León are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.Some of the city’s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you’re in meat country.Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.Compañia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came “to work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.”And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. “I think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.”Along with Doña Mary’s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you’re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony’s Tacos.The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them.“No Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,” says José Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande.“It comes from Mexico – where exactly, it’s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.”As for today, “they’re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila, which all border Texas,” he said.Eddie Vega – who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state – is known as “Taco Poet of Texas.” He points out that historically, what’s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.Before 1836, “the border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.”Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren’t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media.“When you get to south Texas, and I’m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It’s not something we’d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody’s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.”Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them?Austin has “a great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,” Ralat said. “They try some options, and then in their minds, they think it’s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff … and let history speak for itself.”Ralat said San Antonio has “a bit of an inferiority complex that they’re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it’s more diverse, and the food is better.”“To be clear, they’re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they’re also border food. When the Eater article came out” – championing Austin as “home” of the breakfast taco – “San Antonians lost their minds.”Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. “I don’t know that one city – San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo – can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.”Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them.“I think at this point we’ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,” Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. “Is there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.”She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.She also points out the regional differences within Texas.“A flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.”Ralat said he’s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.“I hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. … I want the food to be high quality. I don’t want it to be spin.”Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them – with or without huevos (eggs).“Breakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,” she said.“Bean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn’t have eggs. … Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn’t require eggs. Barbacoa – made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks – is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.”In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter?“Part of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you’ve part of that conversation for a long time.” Vega said.And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.“I think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey … and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.”They’re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. “The place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.”For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning.“I think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture.“It’s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let’s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That’s so nice. And it’s just so joyful.”",travel,0.0

288,312,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hippo-attack-avoid-survive-paul-templer/index.html,"‘I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.’ He survived, and here’s his advice","09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Paul Templer was living his best life.He was 28 and conducting tours in his native Zimbabwe, with a focus on photographic safaris.He had been away for a few years, including a stint in the British army. But he had returned to Africa’s bush country “and fell back in love with it. The wildlife, the flora, the fauna, the great outdoors, the space – just everything about it. I was at home.”Templer said Zimbabwe’s guide certification program was rigorous, and there was a lot of pride among the guides who passed. He reveled in showing tourists the area’s majestic wildlife – including the water-loving, very territorial hippos.“It was idyllic,” he told CNN Travel recently. “Life was really, really good – until one day I had a really bad day at the office.”March 9, 1996. A Saturday. Templer learned a good friend who was to lead a canoe safari down the Zambezi River had malaria. He agreed to take his pal’s place. “I loved that stretch of the river. It was an area I know like the back of my hand.”The expedition consisted of six safari clients (four Air France crewmembers and a couple from Germany), three apprentice guides plus Templer. They had three canoes – clients in the first two seats and a guide in the back. Then one apprentice guide was in a one-person safety kayak.And down the famed Zambezi they went. “Things were going the way they were supposed to go. Everyone was having a pretty good time.”Eventually, they came across a pod of about a dozen hippos. That’s not unexpected on the Zambezi, Africa’s fourth-longest river. They weren’t alarmed at first as they were at a safe distance. But “we were getting closer, and I was trying to take evasive action. … The idea was let’s just paddle safely around the hippos.”Templer’s canoe led the way, with the other two canoes and kayak to follow. He pulled into a little channel waiting on the others. But the third canoe had fallen back from the group and was off the planned course. Templer’s not sure how that happened.“Suddenly, there’s this big thud. And I see the canoe, like the back of it, catapulted up into the air. And Evans, the guide in the back of the canoe, catapulted out of the canoe.” The clients managed to remain in the canoe somehow.“Evans is in the water, and the current is washing Evans toward a mama hippo and her calf 150 meters [490 feet] away. … So I know I’ve got to get him out quickly. I don’t have time to drop my clients off.” He yells to Ben, one of the other guides, to retrieve the clients who were in the canoe that had been attacked.Ben got the clients to safety on a rock in the middle of the river that hippos couldn’t climb.Meanwhile, Templer turned his canoe around to get Evans. The plan was to pull alongside of him and pull him into Templer’s canoe.“I was paddling towards him … getting closer, and I saw this bow wave coming towards me. If you’ve ever seen any of those old movies with a torpedo coming toward a ship, it was kind of like that. I knew it was either a hippo or a really large crocodile coming at me,” he said.“But I also knew that if I slapped the blade of my paddle on water … that’s really loud. And the percussion underwater seems to turn the animals away,” he said. “So I slapped the water, and as it was supposed to do, the torpedo wave stops.”He was getting closer to Evans, but they were also getting closer to the female and calf.“I’m leaning over – it’s kind of a made-for-Hollywood movie – Evans is reaching up. … Our fingers almost touched. And then the water between us just erupted. Happened so fast I didn’t see a thing.”What happened next was nightmarish and surreal.“My world went dark and strangely quiet.” Templer said it took a few seconds to figure out what was going on.“From the waist down, I could feel the water. I could feel I was wet in the river. From my waist up, it was different. I was warm, and it wasn’t wet like the river, but it wasn’t dry either. And it was just incredible pressure on my lower back. I tried to move around; I couldn’t.“I realized I was up to my waist down a hippo’s throat.”There’s a good reason a fully grown hippopotamus can fit a large portion of a fully grown adult in its mouth. Hippos can grow up to 16.5 feet long (5 meters), 5.2 feet tall (1.6 meters) and weigh up to 4.5 tons (4 metric tonnes), according to National Geographic.They sport enormous mouths and can open their strong jaws to 150 degrees.Their teeth might be the most frightening thing of all. Their molars are used for eating plants, but their sharp canines, which might reach 20 inches (51 centimeters), are for defense and fighting. Their bite is almost three times stronger than that of a lion. One bite from a hippo can possibly cut a human body in half.They’re found naturally in various parts sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in East and Southern Africa, living in or near rivers and other water sources. (And they are an invasive species in Colombia thanks to escapees from drug lord Pablo Escobar’s menagerie).Hippos are very territorial and might aggressively attack any animal encroaching on their territory, including hyenas, lions and crocodiles.They also kill people. That we know for sure. Many internet sources say around 500 a year, but an exact figure is still uncertain because some attacks and deaths come in very remote regions and don’t get reported.“The question I get asked the most when people find out I study hippos is: ‘Is it true hippos kill more people than any animal?’ Rebecca Lewison, conservation ecologist and associate professor at San Diego State University, told CNN Travel in an email interview.“I’m not entirely sure where that started but … there is no authority or reliable data. People are surprised that hippos kill people. They look slow, and they are mostly in water. There are some nonfatal interactions, but people (or hippos) tend to fare badly from interactions.”Dr. Philip Muruthi, chief scientist and vice president of species conservation and science of the African Wildlife Fund, said the AWF doesn’t have a credible source on the number of attacks or fatalities either.While more stats need to be collected, one study found that the probability of being killed by a hippopotamus attack is in the range of 29% to 87% – higher than that of a grizzly bear attack at 4.8%, shark attack at 22.7% and crocodile attack at 25%.Those were rather bad odds of survival working against Templer.“I’m guessing I was wedged so far down its throat it must have been uncomfortable because he spat me out. So I burst to the surface, sucked a lungful of fresh air and I came face to face with Evans, the guide who I was trying to rescue. And I said, ‘We got to get out of here!’ ”But Evans was in serious trouble. Templer started swimming back for him “and I was just moving in for your classic lifesaver’s hold when – WHAM! – I got hit from below. So once again, I’m up to my waist down the hippo’s throat. But this time my legs are trapped but my hands are free.”He tried to go for his gun, but he was being thrashed around so much he couldn’t grab it. The hippo – which turned out to be an older, aggressive male – spat Templer out a second time.“This time when I come to the surface I look around, there’s no sign of Evans.” Templer assumed Evans had been rescued, and he tried to escape himself.“I’m making pretty good progress and I’m swimming along there and I come up for the stroke and swimming freestyle and I look under my arm – and until my dying day I’ll remember this – there’s this hippo charging in towards me with his mouth wide open bearing in before he scores a direct hit.”This time, Templer was sideways in the hippo’s mouth, legs dangling out one side of the mouth, shoulders and head on the other side of its mouth.“And then he just goes berserk. … When hippos are fighting, the way they fight is they try to tear apart and just destroy whatever it is they’re attacking,” Templer said.“For me, fortunately everything was happening in slow motion. So when he’d go under water, I’d hold my breath.  When we were on the surface, I would take a deep breath and I would try to hold onto tusks that were boring through me” to stop from being ripped apart.Templer said one of the clients watching the horror later described it like a “vicious dog trying to rip apart a rag doll.”He figures the whole attack took about three and a half minutes.Meanwhile, apprentice guide Mack in the safety kayak – “showing incredible bravery, risking his life to save mine – pulls his boat in inches from my face.” Templer managed to grab a handle on the kayak, and “Mack dragged me to the relative safety of this rock.”The expedition was still in one hell of a mess, though.People living near hippo territory are more likely victims of attacks than tourists, said Lewison.“Most of the attacks happen in the water, but because hippos raid crops on farms, there are also attacks on people trying to protect their crops. There are some tourists, but largely the attacks are happening to local residents,” Lewison said.Human encroachment from Africa’s booming population makes matters worse, increasing the chances of deadly interactions, she said.Despite the encounters gone bad, sub-Saharan Africa depends on hippos.“Hippos are important ecosystem engineers of the ecology of freshwater areas they inhabit. This is through nutrient recycling from dung (they consume large amounts of vegetation),” Muruthi said.“Hippos attack not to eat people, but to get them the hell away from them,” Lewison said. “I don’t think hippos are particularly aggressive, but I think when under pressure, they attack.”Back on the rock in the Zambezi, Templer asked Mack where Evans was. Mack said, “He’s gone, man, he’s just gone.”Templer knew he needed to come up with a plan to get them off the rock and to the riverbank, but “first I needed to settle myself down.”He assessed the situation: One man missing. The first aid kit, radio and gun all gone. Six scared clients, two canoes and one paddle left. And his own body was shattered.“My left foot was especially bad; it looked as if someone had tried to beat a hole through it with a hammer.” He couldn’t move his arms. One arm from elbow down was “crushed to a pulp.”Blood was bubbling out of his mouth. They realized his lung was punctured. Mack rolled Templer over and could see a gaping hole in his back and plugged it with Saran Wrap from a plate of snacks.Templer made the call: No matter the risk, they had to get off that rock.He was loaded into a canoe. Ben paddled. The hippo kept bumping the canoe. He went from being terrified to calm on that ride back.He described “a profound spiritual experience in which I had this incredible sense of peace and realization this was my moment of choice. Like do I go, or do I stay? Do I close my eyes and drift off, or do I fight my way through this and stick around?”“I chose to stick around, and as soon as I made that choice, it was more pain than I could ever imagine I could endure. It was so intense I thought I was going to die, and when I didn’t, I kind of wished I would.”Ben and Templer made it out of the river, but without finding Evans. His body was found three days later. They concluded he had drowned because he didn’t have any signs of animal attack on him.“Evans did nothing wrong. The fact that he died was purely a tragedy.”Meanwhile, some people on shore had realized something was wrong in the river. A well-trained Zimbabwe rescue team was able to safely ferry everyone else off the rock.“And that was my bad day at the office.”Templer was out of the river but not out of the woods.It took eight hours to drive him to the nearest hospital. In a month’s time, he had several major surgeries. He thought he would lose one leg and both arms. His surgeon didn’t think he’d live.But not only did the surgeon save Templer’s life, he saved his legs and one arm. The other arm, however, was beyond salvation.He realized that in the ICU when he woke up and was feeling for his left hand. It was gone. “I just remember feeling devastated. I spent my whole life being active and it was almost more than I could bare.”But then he was flooded with relief to realize his right arm and legs had been saved. For the next month, he was “emotionally all over the map.”He got physical and occupational therapy in Zimbabwe and then more in the United Kingdom. He got a prosthesis “and then just started trying to get back to life.”Templer, Muruthi and Lewison all say safe outings start with education – and avoiding trouble in the first place.“Hippos have no interest in dealing with people. Stay away from them, and they will leave you alone. They are not hunting humans,” Lewison said.“Do not get close to them,” Muruthi said. “They don’t want any intrusion. … They’re not predators; it’s by accident if they’re injuring people.”Want close-up views and photos of the creatures? Instead of venturing too close, invest in good binoculars and telephoto camera lenses.Do not walk along well-worn hippo paths, stay close to your group and don’t approach them from behind, Muruthi said.“Follow the rules. If you are a tourist, and it says ‘Stay in your vehicle,’ then stay in your vehicle. And even when you’re in your vehicle, don’t drive it right to the animal.”Muruthi also advised that your party make some noise in areas known for hippos. “It’s good for them to know you’re around.”“Hippos usually come out of water late in the evening and at night to forage, so avoid trekking along the river at that time,” Muruthi said. Also stay on high alert during the dry season when food is scarce.Get to know the signs of disturbed hippos, Muruthi advised, in case you wander too closely. An agitated one will open its mouth wide and yawn as aggressive display. Also watch for a head thrown back, shaking of the head, grunting and snorting.“These are signs you should have left already!” Muruthi said.If you’ve attracted unwanted attention, Muruthi said to always remember you cannot outrun a hippo. They may look sluggish, but they can run 30 mph (almost 43 kph). Instead, you should try to climb a tree or find an obstacle to put between you and the hippo such as a rock or anthill.Muruthi, Lewison and Templer all said never stay between a hippo and the water. If it’s charging you, run parallel to the water source. As with so many other protective female animals, never get between a mama hippo and her young, Templer said.What if you’re in a small watercraft?“Typically, if a hippo is going to be attacking, you’ll see it coming way before. There will be that bow wave. … If you slap the water, the percussion 99.9 times out of 100 will turn the hippo,” Templer said. “If you’re in a canoe and a hippo knocks you in the water, get away from the canoe. The hippo is going for this big shape, getting it off its territory.”It’s also safer to view hippos on the water in a larger vessel, which the animal would have a harder time capsizing, Muruthi said.Unlike attacks by some other wild animals, humans are almost defenseless once an attack by a large hippo begins.“Once attacked, there is nothing you can do,” Muruthi said. “Fight for dear life and watch for any chance to escape.” He said you could try to poke at the eyes or any spot that might inflict unexpected pain. But given the size just of a hippo head, even that’s a tall order.“Hippos typically hole punch you, so there isn’t much you can do if they get hold of you,” Lewison said.Based on his attack, Templer said try not to panic “when dragged underwater. Remember to suck in air if on the surface.”Another hippo attack survivor in this National Geographic video also was able to conserve her breath. She also grabbed the hippo’s snout, and one expert in the video theorizes that might have startled the hippo into letting her go.Two years after that attack, Templer said that he and a team made the longest recorded descent of the Zambezi River to date. It took three months and covered 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers).How did Templer find the resilience to reclaim his life?After a particularly rough day trying to maneuver in a wheelchair, he said that his surgeon told him: “You’re the sum of your choices. You’re exactly who, what and where you choose to be in life.”Templer said he focused on what’s possible vs. what he’s lost. “If you look for what’s possible, it generally is.”Templer later moved to United States; got married to the sister of a journalist on the record-setting Zambezi trip; wrote the book “What’s Left of Me”; and is a speaker.Should people be afraid to even go on safari – especially in hippo areas – after learning of a harrowing story like Templer’s?Muruthi said go, but go smartly. Be sure to get advice from professional tour guides – and then follow their guidance, Muruthi said. “In Kenya, for example, contact the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association,” he said.Templer said his attack was an “anomaly,” and he doesn’t want anyone to be dissuaded by what happened on his 1996 river run.“My biggest counsel would be: Absolutely go and do it. But hook yourself up with someone who knows what they’re doing out there. But by all means, go out … and experience it.”",travel,0.0
289,313,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html,"How to survive a bear attack – or better yet, avoid one altogether","09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","You’re out for a hike on a glorious fall day. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next?Beth Pratt sure would.She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.“I stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn’t a threatening gesture,” she told CNN Travel last year. “I’m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, ‘just go on your way,’ and went back to eating.”“And I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.”When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though.She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she’s had for more than 10 years. She also worked in Yellowstone for several years – and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.She’s also the author of “When Mountain Lions are Neighbors,” which addresses how people can co-exist with wildlife in California. And there’s a chapter just on bears.Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021.You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt’s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous.“A wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It’s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.”Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen.Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October; they had serious injuries but survived. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department noted “an abundance of bear activity at low elevations” in the area.A hiker died in a suspected grizzly attack in Montana in late March.A 70-year-old hunter was seriously injured by a bear in France in November 2021.In North Carolina, a couple’s unleashed dog attracted unwanted attention from a black bear in early fall 2021 as they were picnicking on the Blue Ridge Parkway; they and their pet survivedAll illustrate the point that rare doesn’t equal never.This is a good time of year to bone up on the bear facts and safety because many bears are now in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. “It’s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.”She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.“They eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that’s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it’s easy calories.”Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble.“If more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there’s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,” Pratt said.The key is being prepared – and that’s where Pratt and others in the know come in.The best strategy is to never get in harm’s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That’s just looking for trouble.The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations.First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don’t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears.You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.Other tips:• Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human.• Walk with a group (we’re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails.• If you have a small child or dog, pick it up.• Don’t put yourself between cubs and their mother.•  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible.Pratt said don’t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it’s not considered an aggressive move.Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make – and fast.First thing is: Stand your ground with bears.With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, “please don’t run. Bears can outrun anybody,” Pratt said. “Don’t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.”New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips:• Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away.• Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.• If you’re with other people, stay together.Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.You’re now in the rarest of situations – you’ve attracted a bear’s attention. It didn’t move off. It’s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you’re about to be attacked. What’s next?One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different.If it’s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead.“You want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,” Pratt said. “Throw things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back – aim for the face.”If you’re dealing with a grizzly that won’t back off and an attack is imminent, you’re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead.“Act as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,” Pratt said. “Tuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.”NPS elaborates: “Remain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.”Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort – “your Hail Mary pass” as Pratt called it – when all other options are out.An exception to this rule: If you’re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight.First off, know your area and read up on the bears there.In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada.Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says.So say you’re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that’s going to be a black bear. But if you’re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That’s when it’s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID.You can’t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don’t.She also said the face shapes are different. “Black bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.”This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences.Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world – from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get.Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has a helpful video and tips on using spray to ward off bears.She’s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you’re inexperienced. “Taking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.”A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn’t permanently harm a bear.Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that “Yelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.”If you’re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take.Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away.Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, “avoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.”Other tips and cautions:• Don’t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads.• Don’t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you.• Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans.Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. “A fed bear is a dead bear.”Pratt emphasized it’s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures.“The bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,” she said.“The bears’ lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.”",travel,0.0
290,314,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html,"How to survive a shark attack – or better yet, avoid one entirely","09:40 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","First things first: Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon.But sharks do occasionally attack humans.Florida teen Addison Bethea was severely injured in the summer of 2022 when a shark attacked her in the waters off Keaton Beach along Florida’s Gulf Coast. A beach closure was put in place after a woman suffered a shark bite off Southern California’s famed Del Mar Beach in November 2022. And in Hawaii, a 60-year-old man was attacked by a shark but was able to swim to a catamaran for help in March 2023.While these kinds of encounter understandably strike fear into would-be ocean swimmers, there’s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low.The Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File found only 73 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 39 confirmed, provoked bites in 2021 worldwide.Think about it a minute – the world population is nearing 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And only 112 bites were logged. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher.In 2021, the United States led the way in unprovoked attacks at 47; Florida had the highest state total at 28.That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel.Know your environmentSharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors.“If you’re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,” said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.“Fortunately, humans aren’t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.”Still, there are places you’re more likely to encounter a shark.River mouths are not the best place to swimYou should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks.“An awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river – people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,” said Peirce.Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out.Avoid areas with fishingBefore you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says “forget it.”“Whether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,” he said.Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That’s a possible sign a shark might be nearby.He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore.Avoid dusk and dawnSwimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it’s also the time when a shark attack is most likely.“A lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,” Peirce says, “due to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.”Hang with lifeguardsChris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to “do your homework” before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places.If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.“I always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It’s a lot safer,” he said.Don’t wear shiny objects in the water“Be careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.” Lowe said.In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. “And you don’t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.”Follow your instincts“Probably the most important thing is to follow your gut,” Hammerschlag said. “If you feel wary about getting in the water … just don’t go in the water.”“A lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn’t listen to it,” he said.Don’t panicSo you’re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic.“Don’t start splashing around – you’re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark’s interest,” said Peirce.Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose.“A shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it’s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,” said Peirce.“That’s why we often get exploratory bites which don’t result in death and sometimes don’t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you’re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.”Maintain eye contactAs the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact.“Sharks are ambush predators,” Peirce explained. “If you’re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it’s not going to be half as comfortable as if it’s able to sneak up from behind.”Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you’re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore.If you’re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. “Let the shark know it’s being watched.”Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand.“You’re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,” Fragola says in the video.Stay big or get smallThis is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.“The bigger you are in the water, the more respect you’ll get,” he said.But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce’s advice is to roll up into a ball.“If a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,” he explained.“If I didn’t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor – and if it wasn’t showing massive interest in me – I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.”Don’t play deadThis isn’t a bear, it’s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots – but be careful where you aim.“There’s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That’s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,” said Peirce.“This is a moving object in the water and you’re not staying still either, so what you don’t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.”A good shot to the gills can also do the job: “The gills are very sensitive – giving a shark a whack in the gills isn’t a bad idea.”Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.“If you’re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you’re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,” Peirce says.“I’ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it’s (been) enough to use a shark billy – a small metal rod between two and three feet long – and I’ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.”It’s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you’ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten.Cut off the anglesIf you’re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can’t get behind you, says Peirce.“Keep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you’ve only got one direction to look. You’re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.”Slowly back awayDisplace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore.“You must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you’ve got to be careful – large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.”Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim.“If a white shark is in full attack mode, there’s not much you’re going to be able to do at that point,” he says.",travel,0.0

We will not tolerate such behaviour in our club.”In response to an inquiry about Saturday’s game, a spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN that it is investigating allegations of racial abuse.“Officers are carrying out enquiries,” the spokesperson said. “No arrests have been made at this time.”Tottenham said it was aware of the alleged incident and called discrimination of any kind “abhorrent.”“We will do everything in our powers to ensure that if found guilty, the individual will receive the strongest possible action – as was the case earlier this season when Son suffered similar racial abuse at Chelsea,” Spurs said in a statement on Sunday.Last August, Chelsea said the club had identified and banned a season ticket holder “indefinitely” after reports emerged that Son was racially abused during a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge.On Sunday, the Premier League said in a tweet that it “condemns all forms of discrimination” and that “no one should have to suffer abuse of the kind received by Heung-Min Son.”Tottenham defeated Crystal Palace 1-0 to move up to sixth in the Premier League table thanks to Harry Kane’s header at the end of the first half.That took Kane to 209 Premier League goals as he moved to second in the league’s all-time scoring list ahead of Wayne Rooney.",sport,0.0

Forte was the fifth horse to be scratched from the race and so the number of horses in the main event dropped to 18. It is the first time since 1936 that five horses have been scratched from the Derby.“I never give up, I always try hard,” jockey Javier Castellano said. “It took me a little while to get there, to finally get it.” The victory was the first at the Kentucky Derby for Castellano in 16 attempts.Prior to the Kentucky Derby, Mage only had one victory in three career starts. On Saturday, he finished the “Greatest two minutes in Sports” with a time of 2:01.57.Mage will now have a chance to continue the chase for the elusive Triple Crown at the Preakness Stakes in Maryland on May 20. The third leg is at the Belmont Stakes in New York on June 10.This year’s Derby was marred by an unusually high number of horse deaths in days preceding the main event, and two more died in earlier races Saturday. In total, seven horses have died since April 27.Chloe’s Dream and Freezing Point both “sustained racing injuries from which they could not recover on Saturday, and for humane reasons, both were euthanized,” according to Darren Rogers, senior director of communications and media services for Churchill Downs.Chloe’s Dream suffered a right knee fracture during Race 2 at the top of the first turn, Chuchhill Downs said in a news release Saturday night. Meanwhile, Freezing Point suffered a left front biaxial sesamoid fracture midway down the backstretch in Race 8, according to the release.The company said each incident was “unique” and that the track surfaces are closely monitored by industry experts to maintain their integrity. Each horse that races at the track goes through “multiple, comprehensive veterinarian exams” and observations to ensure they are fit to race, the statement said.Churchill Downs said it will “actively work” with the Kentucky Horseracing Commission and the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority to investigation each incident to find out “any health or environmental causes and supply what they learn to continue to improve the safety of the sport.“We are proud of the enduring legacy of the Kentucky Derby and these magnificent horses are central to its iconic appeal,” Churchill Downs said. “While we believe the incidents leading to this year’s Derby are anomalies, they are unacceptable and we remain steadfast in our commitment to safety and integrity.”On Friday, racehorse trainer Saffie Joseph Jr. was suspended indefinitely by Churchill Downs following the “highly unusual” deaths of two of his horses, Parents Pride and Chasing Artie.Three other horses – not trained by Joseph – also died in recent days. According to Churchill Downs, Wild on Ice, a Derby contender, was hurt while training on Thursday and Take Charge Briana was injured in a race on Tuesday. Both were “euthanized for humane reasons.”On April 29, 3-year-old gelding Code of Kings died after flipping and breaking his neck in Churchill’s temporary paddock before a race, according to Daily Racing Form.Animal rights organization PETA released a statement following the two deaths Saturday, saying, “Churchill Downs is a killing field. Freezing Point is the latest casualty. He’s the second horse to die today at the track, making it an appalling seven deaths in advance of the Kentucky Derby. They should play ‘Taps’ at the Derby instead of ‘My Old Kentucky Home.’”",sport,0.0

It just makes sense in every way - business, history, timing. I consider myself fairly young at 36.“These are the challenges that I like, that’s the stuff that really wakes me up in the morning. It’s a challenge within me. It’s just cool to have a bar that can motivate you and push you. That’s what I want to be remembered for – to be the greatest combat athlete of all time.”But Sterling (22-3) will be a difficult opponent and he has twice successfully defended his title, most recently in October. In Friday’s weigh-in, the pair got into a heated exchange and Sterling has said that he thrives in the chaos.“In the middle of the chaos, I’m jumping into the fire,” he told ESPN. “… I’ve learned how to turn it on and handle what I need to handle.”In the US, the main card can be watched on ESPN+ PPV from 10 p.m. ET.",sport,0.0

295,319,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/motorsport/formula-one-miami-grand-prix-2023-spt-intl/index.html,Miami Grand Prix: Everything you need to know as Formula One returns to Florida,2023-05-07 06:22:00,"Formula One returns to Miami this weekend for just the second time, and for the first of three US-based races this season.The fifth round of the 2023 season will see a return to the traditional Friday practice, Saturday qualifying and Grand Prix Sunday format following a revamped sprint weekend in Baku, which had two qualifying sessions, a sprint race and the Grand Prix.Despite more competitive sessions, fans were left disappointed with the lack of overtaking in last week’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix.Speaking to the media after the race, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff bluntly labeled the event as “boring” before adding that “we have to analyze the weekend with the sprint format, whether there’s positives we can take out.”Fans will be hoping that the 57 laps in Miami can conjure up more exciting racing.The race will begin at 3:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, May 7, with Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez in pole position having qualified ahead of Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso.Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz is third, while championship leader Max Verstappen will start from ninth after an error in the final session.The race is being broadcast on ABC and ESPN+ in the United States. Click here for broadcast information outside the United States.In last year’s inaugural Miami Grand Prix, Ferrari locked out the front row in qualifying with Charles Leclerc taking pole position and teammate Carlos Sainz starting P2.However, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen came from P3 to win the race, overtaking Sainz into turn one on lap one and passing Leclerc down the main straight on lap nine. Leclerc finished second and Sainz was third.All three were then given an extravagant police escort to the podium, before donning NFL helmets instead of the traditional Pirelli caps.Red Bull comes into this year’s race with a striking new fan-designed livery and, more importantly, a commanding 93-point lead in the constructors’ championship. The team’s drivers have two race wins each, with Verstappen leading Sergio Pérez by six points in the drivers’ championship.Mercedes driver George Russell commented to the media after the opening race in Bahrain: “I expect they [Red Bull] should win every single race this season. That is my bet. With the performance they’ve got, I don’t see anyone challenging them.”So far, his prediction has held true with Red Bull winning all four of the opening races, while also taking a 1-2 in three of those. Only a chaotic Australian Grand Prix, in which Pérez began from the pit lane after crashing in qualifying, has prevented a perfect start for Red Bull.After finishing third in Azerbaijan, 21 seconds behind Verstappen, Leclerc told reporters that “Red Bull are in another league when it comes to the race.” Barring any dramatic performance upgrades from the chasing pack – or surprise events – Red Bull should be confident about continuing its imperious form.As such, when the winner pops the champagne in Miami, they will likely be draped in Red Bull overalls, with the biggest question being whether Pérez can close the gap on his title-holding teammate and ignite an intra-team championship fight.Following his sixth career win in Baku, 33-year-old Pérez told Sky Sports that, without his issues in Melbourne, he “should be leading the championship.”When speaking to reporters after the Mexican’s victory, team boss Christian Horner maintained his drivers “were free to race today and, all year so far, they’ve been free,” dispelling any ideas of potential team orders favoring one or the other.Ferrari and Leclerc will be hoping to build on a positive weekend in Baku after taking their first podium of the season. The Scuderia has made a stuttering start to the season but will be more confident of closing the gap on Red Bull after the Monegasque driver took pole for both the sprint and feature race.Mercedes continues to play catch up, with seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in P6 and Russell in P8 at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.The Silver Arrows have again been off the leading pace this season and aren’t expected to bring major car upgrades until the sixth round in Imola. Speaking to Sky Sports, Hamilton admitted he is “counting down the days” until the upgrades, adding that “it will be the start of something new for us.”The Brackley-based team remains third in the constructors’ championship, ahead of a resurgent Aston Martin whose rise up the order and three podiums for two-time champion Fernando Alonso has been one of the stories of the season thus far.Florida-born rookie Logan Sargeant will be hoping to score his first F1 points at his home Grand Prix.The Williams driver is the first American on the F1 grid since Alexander Rossi in 2015 and will be looking to break into the top 10. The 22-year-old came close with a P12 finish in the Bahrain opener but has since not finished higher than 16th.The 3.36-mile temporary circuit – located in the Hard Rock Stadium complex, home to the NFL’s Miami Dolphins – remains unchanged from last season in layout, but has been resurfaced after a variety of complications with last year’s tarmac.Away from the track, the teams’ housing and hospitality units have been moved away from the traditional paddock and will remarkably now sit on the pitch of the Hard Rock Stadium.Once again, expect F1’s glitz and glamor and the Miami sun to attract some of the world’s most famous faces to the track Sunday.",sport,0.0
296,320,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/sport/raging-bull-havoc-france-rugby-league-spt-intl/index.html,Players forced to run for cover as raging bull creates havoc at a rugby league match in France,2023-05-07 07:05:00,"Chaos ensued before a rugby league match between the Catalans Dragons and St Helens on Friday when a bull escaped from a pre-match parade and rampaged around the field.Television cameras showed the bull breaking free of its handler, dragging him along the ground, and charging around the field. Scattering players dropped rugby balls as they ran for cover, while some players even jumped over the barriers into the crowd.Eventually, after about 30 seconds, the bull made its way back to its handlers and the other animals standing beside the field at the Gilbert Brutus stadium in Perpignan, France.Originally, the club had intended to present three prize-winning bulls and two cows to the crowd before the match as a way to honor local breeding and promote Guasch Viandes, the meat business held by club Chairman Bernard Guasch, but it didn’t quite go exactly as planned.The match itself proved more successful for the Catalans Dragons as they secured a 24-12 victory, overcoming a 12-point deficit early in the first half.It marked a significant win over the reigning Super League champion St Helens, sealed by tries from Arthur Mourgue, Matt Ikuvalu and two from Tom Davies.“It was a bizarre start to the match,” Dragons head coach Steve McNamara said afterwards. “We were in control and then 12-0 down all of a sudden. Just two lapses in concentration and we were punished, but what a response, 24 points from us after that point.”",sport,0.0
297,321,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/football/napoli-serie-a-title-win-2022-23-italy-spt-intl/index.html,Napoli’s Serie A title win: From Maradona and financial bankruptcy to Scudetto,2023-05-05 06:17:00,"On April 29, 1990, ‘Nothing Compares 2 U’ by Sinead O’Connor topped the charts in the US, the Detroit Pistons had just begun their road to a second successive NBA title and cranes began pulling down the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate.In Naples, Marco Baroni was leaping into the Italian spring air to head a ball past a diving goalkeeper to put Napoli one goal ahead against Lazio.One seemingly small event sent a fandom and a city crazy with joy.The defender’s powerful header was the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory and those three points assured Napoli’s position atop Serie A, two points ahead of AC Milan who also won that day.In doing so, Baroni clinched the club’s second ever Italian league title, cementing its golden era into Napoli folklore – an era spearheaded by the great Diego Maradona.The joy of those two Scudetto title successes didn’t last that long though: Napoli suffered relegations, financial difficulties, near misses and the coming and going of superstars – all without reclaiming that elusive third title.That was until this year. Led by the towering Nigerian Victor Osimhen, the enigmatic Georgian Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and coach Luciano Spalletti, Napoli has romped to the Serie A title, ending 33 years in the wilderness. A fandom and a city, again, rejoice.“The city is special. For example, it’s very difficult for others to understand what we do for our club,” Daniele ‘Decibel’ Bellini, Napoli’s stadium announcer, told CNN Sport.In recent years, Bellini has gone viral for his videos announcing Napoli’s goalscorers during games. His ‘call and response’ style with the fans leaves viewers with goosebumps, such is the enthusiasm displayed from both parties.One YouTube video of Bellini calling out the name of former Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuaín has been viewed over six million times. In the video, Bellini calls out the Argentine’s first name nine times, with the Napoli faithful roaring back the player’s surname in response.“Every time, I tell them the club is like a girlfriend, is like a mother, is something special for us. And this is the reason for all this passionate, all this incredible love for the team and maybe this is the reason when I go to the stadium and I do my job, the people wait for me for pictures and signatures and videos.”But, after years of heartache, the title victory is important for so much more than just on field success; it is a victory for southern Italy against its northern rivals, not least because there has long been economic tension between those two parts of the country.“It will be not just the first time Napoli has won the title since Maradona, but the first time the true south has won, if you’re not counting Rome” Kirsten Schlewitz – Napoli fan and author of the upcoming book ‘More Than Maradona: The Birth, Death and Rebirth of SSC Napoli’ – told CNN.“It is a big deal for the city as a whole to have that pride and to be able to say: ‘Look, we can do it too. You don’t need to be the rich northerners. We assembled a smart squad.’“It’s not a club where teams can just come in and pick off their players and there’s an incredible pride in Napoli developing, Napoli finding the good players, not so much for the youth squad, but being able to be that smart team that can build a competitive squad without …  spending big money on players who are over the hill.“So there’s that pride in being able to say: ‘Yeah, but yeah the south did this and the south did this in a different way.’”Football is in Naples’ DNA.Whether it is the fanatical supporters crammed into the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium on matchdays or the hordes of fans who race through the streets after a Napoli victory, not much gets done on the day of a home game.Bellini says the vice-like grip that the club has on the city is down to Naples only playing host to one major team, Napoli – a phenomenon unlike most other Serie A cities.“Milan has two, Turin have two, Rome have two and Genoa also have two,” he explains. “Naples is the only big, big, big city in Italy where we have just one club. And this is very important for us and all the people here support Naples.”As a result, every home game is like a festival of football, with fans reveling in the displays of brilliance their favorite Napoli players – dressed in the sky-blue shirts and white shorts – produce.Over the years, they’ve had their fair share of awe-inspiring players who have dazzled and astonished – most notably, the diminutive genius, Maradona.The Argentine arrived in the south of Italy in 1984, joining from Barcelona for a then world-record fee of $10.5 million.With Maradona’s arrival came a level of success Napoli had previously never seen, culminating in a 1987 title victory; the club’s first ever Scudetto.Bellini remembers how he celebrated the victory as a six-year-old whose fandom for Napoli was burgeoning.“I stayed on the balcony in my house with my flag, and you can find the picture on Instagram. With my flag on the balcony without possibility to do something or do fiesta or with the supporters, because I was very, very little. But very happy. Very proud. When I was born, I was born with Maradona and that Napoli and, always in my life, I support Naples.”Three years later, Napoli reclaimed the title, once again with Maradona at the forefront.For a city and football club that had often been looked down upon by its northern rivals, that run of success was an opportunity for the region to proudly express its time on top.When Napoli won its first Serie A title in 1987, the Gentleman Ultra website notes: “In the city, mock funerals were held for Juventus. Naples finally had a riposte to their overweening Northern foes: ‘May 1987, the other Italy has been defeated, a new empire is born.’”But that four-year stretch proved to be an abnormality rather than a trend.A year after the 1990 title success, the Napoli team began to unwind with players departing, leading to a drop in performances.The headline departure came when Maradona failed a drug test and he left Italy in disgrace after being handed a 15-month ban.Following years of steady decline, the club was relegated from Serie A after claiming a miserly 14 points from 34 games. Only eight years after being crowned Italian champion, Napoli found itself in the second tier.The disappointment didn’t end there though for Napoli. Despite a small respite back in the top-flight in the 2000/01 season, the club was immediately relegated after their first season back in Serie A before the club was declared bankrupt for the second year in a row, which saw it relegated to the third tier of Italian football.Although the club had fallen to its lowest league position in its history dating back to the 1920s, Bellini says the fanatical support around the club never suffered.“You can find on the Internet or in a YouTube the video when we are in Serie C with 60,000 people at the stadium and the opposing team are a very tiny team and they are not able to play in San Paolo stadium [what is now the Diego Maradona stadium] in front of 60,000 people. And this is the big passion, big passion of Neapolitan people and big love for this club.”But like a phoenix, Naples rose from the ashes; spearheaded by the most unlikely of saviors.When the club was at its most vulnerable financially, in swooped Italian film giant Aurelio De Laurentiis to rescue the club with the aim of establishing stability and a return to former glories.And De Laurentiis made good on his promises, bringing Napoli back into the Italian top-flight in three years and into European competitions in the second year back in Serie A.De Laurentiis’ no-nonsense approach to running the club has brought success but has also brought tension. Fans and De Laurentiis have been at loggerheads about new proposed ticket prices although a picture posted on the owner’s Twitter account suggests that that tension has been resolved for now.Schlewitz says that despite any friction against the owner, “a whole lot is going to be forgiven” with the title victory.Behind savvy transfer dealings and shrewd coaching appointments, the club established itself as one of Italy’s elite.In the 16 years since the club’s return to Serie A, Napoli fans have seen some of Europe’s best players grace the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium pitch – from Edinson Cavani and Higuaín to Dries Mertens and Marek Hamšík – as well as rotating cast of elite managers – Walter Mazzarri, Rafael Benítez, Maurizio Sarri and Carlo Ancelotti have all had stints in the Naples dugout.However, beyond cup success, Napoli was never able to reclaim that elusive Scudetto behind the dominance of Italy’s northern clubs.“It’s very, very hard to win in Italy because the north of Italy has a high representative of teams as Juventus, as Milan, as Inter and, in the south, it’s very difficult to (win),” Bellini said.“For example, Roma or Lazio in the center of Italy have only two or three times won the title because it is very, very difficult to win against the north; against the money, power of those clubs. And when we had Maradona in our club, we did this. We win against the against Juventus, against Milan, against Inter.”The 2022/23 season has been different though.Behind a previously unheralded squad – Kvaratskhelia was signed from Georgia for little fanfare, the midfielder trio of Stanislav Lobotka, André-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Piotr Zieliński have all flattered to deceive before and Kim Min-jae arrived from Turkey in the summer to transform the defense into one of the league’s most formidable – Napoli has blown away the domestic competition.The team’s unheralded star though, according to Schlewitz, is left back Mário Rui. Rui signed for the club in 2017 under Sarri but has undergone a transformation this season.“I have to say that I intensely disliked Mario Rui. And he just used to make all kinds of mistakes,” Schlewitz said. “He came in 2017 and he would either go into tackles too hard or he would turn the ball over too quickly or just be in the wrong place at the wrong time.“And now he is 31, and it’s like he’s finally grown into the player that he was always supposed to be. And I’m just glad that the squad had faith to keep him around because he’s kind of the anchor point. And he’s not our captain in name, but he’s kind of our captain in spirit.”Even the team’s manager, Spalletti, came to Naples with a reputation of producing beautiful footballing teams but ones that falter at the crucial moments.Whereas in previous seasons where fans would avoid talking about title challenges out of a fear of jinxing the team, Bellini says the huge lead the team established after last year’s World Cup break allowed fans to dream before Thursday’s draw sealed the title victory.Over 30 years after Maradona led Napoli to its last Serie A title, Osimhen, Kvaratskhelia and company have done the same to end the heartache of some of Italy’s most passionate fans.And for someone who has been working inside the Napoli stadium and around the team for approximately 14 years – and as a fervent fan himself – Bellini said this moment had been a long time coming and that he has an idea of how he’ll announce the team’s title success to the stadium when they play at home for the first time as champions.“I have something in my mind, but I don’t know very well what my heart suggests to me because I don’t want to prepare something special or special words for that moment because I think my heart can suggest the best word in that moment,” he said.Bellini added: “I’ve dreamed of this moment since when I was young, and especially since when I start to do this job with Naples, I dreamed this whole night.“This is special.”",sport,0.0

Jackson’s deal also reportedly included $185 million guaranteed, with $135 million of that fully guaranteed.But the process was fueled with rumors of interest from other teams inquiring about stealing the 2019 NFL MVP away from the team that drafted him.And although he admits he took phone calls from other teams, he never really wanted to leave Baltimore.“To be honest with you, I really didn’t care for other teams, really,” Jackson told reporters during his signing press conference. “I just really wanted to get something done here.“I wanted to be here. I was like, ‘Man, OK, other teams cool, but I want to be a Raven.’ … I really wanted to get this done before anything, before my time up and branch off somewhere else. I really want to finish my career here and win a Super Bowl here.”Jackson, who represented himself through the whole process without an agent, said it was important to wait for the correct deal before returning, but says he’s looking forward with excitement about what is to come.“It’s a business. It’s a business at the end of the day,” he said. “If you’re going to represent yourself, you’ve gotta have a strong mind.“I wouldn’t say you get out there and put your feelings in it because it’s not about feelings. … It’s a grown-man thing at the end of the day, so you’ve gotta be a grown man if you’re gonna handle business.”Ravens General Manager Eric DeCosta said of the process: “I was dealing with Lamar Jackson the agent … [He was] very impressive, patient, demanding, honest, straightforward. It wasn’t always easy. I’d rather deal with Lamar Jackson the player.“I’m not going to lie to you and say every day was great. It’s been a long stretch … [But] we had a lot of conviction that this was the right thing to do [to make him the highest paid player in the league]. It made a lot of sense. It just took a lot of patience.”Jackson soon turned attention to what’s to come for the Ravens: “Today, we’re gonna keep it about the future. I’m not really worried about what happened in the past. We’re gonna keep it about these next five years and keep it about what’s going on today.”During the time when the two camps were negotiating the new deal, the Ravens took steps to completely revamp the group Jackson will throw the ball to, as well as the offensive coaching staff.Headline among those was the addition of wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and the drafting of Zay Flowers in the first round of the NFL Draft.The combination of those two additions and the hiring of Todd Monken as the team’s offensive coordinator has pumped Jackson up with renewed excitement to get to work with his teammates.“I’m very eager, to be honest with you,” he said. “I think I told someone, ‘I want to throw for 6,000 yards with the weapons we have.’“I’m not an individual award type of guy or a stat watcher. I just want to do that because no one has ever done that, and I feel like we have the weapons to do it. We’ve got explosive guys.“Like coach said, the new additions Zay, OBJ, and we got (Rashod) Bateman going to be 100 percent healthy, too. … Can’t forget about Mark (Andrews), can’t forget about my boy Mark, and (Isaiah) Likely. So, can’t wait to get rolling.”",sport,0.0

I protected myself.”The 60-year-old manager has been sent off three times in Serie A this season – most recently in February during a defeat against Cremonese.Mourinho chastised match referee Daniele Chiffi after the game, describing the official as “the worst I have ever seen in my 20-year career” to Roma’s in-house media team, as well as telling DAZN that Chiffi is “technically horrible” and “not empathetic from a human point of view.”The Portuguese manager also suggested to Roma’s media team that other clubs influence which referees officiate their games.“I have to say that as a club, we don’t have the power that other clubs do – to say and demand: ‘This referee – I don’t want him,’” he said.“There are other clubs that do that, and we know clearly they do that because there are referees that never officiate these teams.”CNN has reached out to the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for comment on Mourinho’s actions and allegations.Roma’s draw with Monza leaves the team in seventh place in the league table, outside the qualification places for next season’s European competitions.

We feel these measures are our duty and responsibility,” he added.Parents Pride and Chasing Artie were among four horses that died at Churchill Downs in a five-day stretch.The other two died after suffering musculoskeletal injuries, track officials said. Wild on Ice, a Derby contender, was hurt while training April 27, and Take Charge Briana was injured in a race on Tuesday. Both were “euthanized for humane reasons,” according to Churchill Downs.After learning of his suspension, Joseph told CNN affiliate WDRB that he believed Churchill Downs was treating him unfairly.“I’m the scapegoat,” he told WDRB on Thursday. “They’ve had more deaths this week, and here is Saffie, this is the problem. Trust me, it’s hard enough that our horses have their issues.“But the reality of it is that …  I’ve never had horses that die from that issue before. They’ve had injuries but never from something that was unknown. It’s unknown what caused it.”Before the suspension was announced, Joseph told CNN Thursday he was “uneasy and broken” over the deaths of the horses he trained.“Right now, I don’t know why this has happened, which makes us uneasy,” Joseph said.“People who don’t come to the track don’t see the passionate care of these horses,” he said.Joseph told CNN at that time the investigation into the deaths had found “no significant findings yet.”",sport,0.0
301,325,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/football/tragedy-chanting-in-the-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html,Tragedy chanting: ‘Vile’ soccer songs about deaths fueled by ‘need to hurt’ opposing fans,2023-05-03 07:04:00,"Described as “vile” and “unacceptable” and fueled by “the need to hurt,” ‘tragedy chanting’ is becoming an increasing concern to soccer authorities.In England, the phenomenon is defined as the singing of songs about disasters that have befallen other clubs or their fan bases.‘Tragedy chanting’ has marred a number of matches already this season, though they tend to only occur at matches involving one or both of Manchester United and Liverpool, with some opposition fans referencing the Munich air disaster or stadium tragedies of Hillsborough and Heysel.In February 1958, 23 people – including eight Manchester United players and three members of the club’s staff – died as the team’s plane tried to take off from Munich’s airport.In May 1985, 39 fans – 32 from Italy, four from Belgium, two from France and one from Northern Ireland – were killed in a stampede ahead of the European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.Then, in 1989, overcrowding in the stands ahead of the FA Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans.Chris Rowland, editor of the website “The Tomkins Times,” which covers Liverpool FC, says “it’s hard to explain” why supporters of clubs that have experienced tragedies in the past would engage in tragedy chanting towards other fanbases.“It’s as if they’ve forgotten,” Rowland tells CNN Sport. “It’s almost as though the need to hurt exceeds everything else, as far as I can see.“The need to hurt the opposing supporters, it seems to me, is the driving influence here. Any club that’s been involved [in a tragedy], nobody from those clubs should ever do it again.”While most fans are quick to condemn the offensive chanting, the practice shows no sign of going away.In February, Leeds and Manchester United released a joint statement following the club’s Premier League fixture after incidents of tragedy chanting from both sets of fans, which targeted both the Munich air disaster and the death of two Leeds fans in 2000 the day before a UEFA Cup semifinal against Galatasaray in Istanbul.Another case of tragedy chanting by a group of Chelsea fans in a 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in early April – which the London club condemned as “hateful” – caused the Premier League to issue a statement saying it would be addressing the issue “as a priority and as a matter of urgency.”Additionally, some Manchester City and Nottingham Forest fans have been criticized this season for singing songs about Hillsborough in matches against Liverpool.However, in the return fixture against Liverpool at Anfield, the traveling Forest supporters were praised for unveiling a banner calling for respect for the victims and the end to tragedy chanting.In an attempt to eradicate the issue, the Premier League has set up a working group with top-flight clubs to educate supporters about the tragedies in question and the impact such chanting has on fans.The working group has also been in contact with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to discuss whether convictions can be pursued for fans that engage in tragedy chanting.Geoff Pearson, a professor at Manchester University who has specialized in football crowd disorder, says self-policing within a fan base is “absolutely the key” to eradicating the practice, especially as some of the chants “aren’t by their content unlawful.”This makes asking the police to get involved “quite challenging,” he explains.“The most powerful thing is when the fan in front of you just turns around and says: ‘Shut up, we don’t do that at this club,’ because that is a powerful message,” Pearson told CNN Sport.“It’s humiliating for the fan that’s done that and I think this explains for a large part why we have almost eradicated overt racist chanting in English football stadiums.“You go away with England [the national team] and you go into certain bars, and you will hear racist chanting, but you don’t hear it in the stadium because that’s where it has become unacceptable.“But a combination of messaging and, occasionally – if you have a really entrenched problem – banning some individuals or taking criminal action if you can against some individuals has also made an impact.”CNN has reached out to the UK government’s Football Policing Unit, but has yet to receive a response.Neil Atkinson, a writer for Liverpool FC website “The Anfield Wrap,” echoes those sentiments, telling CNN the first thing fans should do if a fellow supporter begins engaging in tragedy chanting is to “drown it out” with other songs.“If it isn’t the majority of supporters, it shouldn’t be the majority of the noise and there is an immediate practical step [people can take],” he says.“The next thing is education through action by the clubs. Leeds United have been looking to do that,” Atkinson adds, referring to the anti-chanting campaign launched by the Yorkshire club last year.“Arsenal and Fulham have both visited the [Hillsborough] memorial. I still think a wider societal understanding of what happened in 1989 and the smears that have followed would be no bad thing in general.”Last month, Arsenal and Fulham’s team managers and captains laid wreaths at the Hillsborough memorial to mark the 34th anniversary of the disaster.In the immediate aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster and in the years that followed, the Sun newspaper and local South Yorkshire police launched a campaign of misinformation that tried to place the blame on Liverpool supporters, according to an independent inquest.Ahead of Manchester United’s visit to Anfield last month, managers Jurgen Klopp and Erik ten Hag released a joint statement urging supporters of both clubs to stop chants in stadiums and online abuse relating to the tragedies.“It is unacceptable to use the loss of life — in relation to any tragedy — to score points, and it is time for it to stop,” United boss ten Hag said.“Those responsible tarnish not only the reputation of our clubs but also, importantly, the reputation of themselves, the fans, and our great cities.”Liverpool’s Klopp added that chants about tragedies “have no place in football.”“If we can keep the passion and lose the poison it will be so much better for everyone,” he said.While this is by no means a new issue – Pearson notes some of the earliest Munich chants happened during the 1957/58 season – it has undoubtedly become more prevalent this season.Charlotte Hennessey, whose father James was one of the 97 fans who died at Hillsborough, created a petition calling for tragedy chanting to be made a criminal offense, which has received more than 17,000 signatures.Speaking to the Mirror earlier this month, she described what it feels like to hear opposition fans singing about the tragedy.“All I wanted to do was watch the football in my own home with my children,” she said of Liverpool’s match at City. “Then I hear the hate chanting.“The chanting starts, and I can’t even watch the match,” said Charlotte, 40. “I have to explain to my children why people are so cruel, and how the lies go all the way back to 1989.”For those affected by the tragedies, hearing those chants “hurts us all,” Rowland says, “certainly those of us who were there.“You only have to imagine how that hurts those who lost relatives and friends.”",sport,0.0

He posted $100,000 bond and was released, court records show.Jackson Mahomes has risen to fame in recent years with his social media content, including his TikTok account which has over a million followers.Mahomes did not speak during his first court appearance. Before he posted bond, he appeared virtually in custody from the jail, according to CNN affiliate KCTV.Upon leaving court, he did not respond to reporters’ questions about the incident. A man escorting him said, “We can’t say anything right now, excuse us.”In a statement sent to CNN, Jackson Mahomes’ agent, Brandan Davies, said: “The Court has prohibited the defendant and lawyers from commenting on the matter.”CNN has reached out to the Aspens Restaurant and Lounge, site of the alleged incident, for comment.In March, prior to charges being filed, Davies sent a statement to KCTV.“We have provided law enforcement with the tools and evidence they need to evaluate the claims against Jackson,” the statement read, per KCTV. “Every interaction between people needs to be placed in the proper context. Releasing a short clip of any video does not provide proper context. We have faith in the process and look forward to a swift resolution of the matter.”Mahomes has a court date scheduled for May 11.Prosecutors allege in the criminal complaint that Mahomes “unlawfully and feloniously touch[ed] the person of another … who did not consent to the touching, with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of the offender or another” and “unlawfully and knowingly cause[d] physical contact with another person … done in a rude, insulting, or angry manner.”Court records also show that the judge instructed Mahomes that he cannot publicly comment on the case or the facts and can have no contact with the victim or any witnesses.Mahomes’ brother, Patrick, is the starting quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs.

303,327,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/06/sport/running-four-minute-mile-spt-intl/index.html,"‘Like a chairlift up Everest’: Once running’s supreme challenge, has the value of a four-minute mile diminished?",2023-05-06 04:18:00,"To Roger Bannister, the final few seconds felt like they would never end, pain overwhelming his body as he lurched towards the finish line.But when he did break the tape, gratefully falling into the arms of bystanders shortly after, the famed middle-distance runner knew immediately what he had achieved.As Bannister gasped for breath, the announcer tasked with declaring the finishing time got as a far as “three …” before the noise of the crowd drowned out the rest, for the exact time now seemed irrelevant.It was 69 years ago on Saturday that Bannister became the first man ever to run a mile inside four minutes, gaining sporting immortality in three minutes, 59.4 seconds at Iffley Road track in Oxford, England.The achievement, thought by some at the time to be impossible, had been dubbed running’s Everest in the years leading up to that day in 1954, though it didn’t take long for the record to be lowered even more.Australian John Landy, one of Bannister’s rivals also gunning to break the four-minute barrier, took more than a second off the Briton’s time in Turku, Finland, a few weeks later.But it’s Bannister’s landmark record that remains history’s most famous mile effort. In the years that followed, male athletes treated their first sub-four-minute mile as a watershed moment – a rite of passage on the way to becoming a top middle-distance runner.“I was on cloud nine for two weeks … I remember I’d be sitting in the car driving and I’d get this big smile just thinking about that sub-four-minute mile,” former American track runner Dave Wottle, who first dipped under four minutes in 1970, told CNN Sport last year.“It was just something that takes you right to the core of how important it was.”Wottle was the 39th American man to break four minutes in the mile, an achievement he ranks on par with equaling the 800-meter world record and winning Olympic gold.“Back then, getting under that four-minute mile was a big thing, especially for milers,” he added.The four-minute mile captured the imagination of the general public partly because it was easily quantifiable – four laps of a running track, each lap run in under a minute – but also because of the appetite for discovery at the time of Bannister’s record.Edmund Hilary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay had become the first people to summit the world’s highest peak the year before, and the first four-minute mile duly became running’s own Everest summit, expanding perceptions of human potential.As well as Bannister and Landy, American Wes Santee was also bidding to break four minutes at the same time, though he fell short of the mark on several occasions throughout his career.“This kind of combination of factors I think came together and made it this mythical undertaking,” author and performance coach Steve Magness tells CNN Sport. “It became this almost Western, country battle to see who could get there first.”Today, the four-minute mile is still recognized as a notable achievement for male runners, though the frequency with which athletes break the barrier has become a topic of contention.Earlier this year, Track and Field News magazine announced it would no longer update its list of Americans to break four minutes in the mile, explaining in a statement how advances in shoe technology “bombarded the 4:00 barrier into something no longer relevant for tracking.”However, the publication reversed the decision after criticism from readers, who still deemed the four-minute mile an accomplishment worth recognizing.It was common for fewer than 10 new runners to enter the Track and Field News annals each year in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, but today the record books tell a different story.According to Track and Field News’ records, 63 American men have run a sub-four-minute mile for the first time this year – and that number is likely to rise in the coming months – while 64 did last year.“It still has some mystique,” Magness says about the status of the four-minute mile today. “I think where it differs is it’s not that insurmountable mystique – especially after the last couple of years when we’ve seen a rapid uptick in performance and the number of athletes who have gone under four.”For long-time track and field coach Peter Thompson, recent developments in shoe technology have been central to increasingly fast times over the mile – especially since middle-distance running spikes with carbon fiber plates in the soles became widely available in 2021.“Four minutes was the Everest,” Thompson tells CNN Sport, “and somebody said to me recently it’s like they’ve put a chairlift up Everest now.”Thompson has previously worked with running brand Hoka to develop carbon-fiber-plated shoes and delivered a workshop on the performance-enhancing effect of “super shoes” and “super spikes” – as they are now ubiquitously known – at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, last year.The carbon plates, Thompson says, function as “spring-like devices” and give runners more energy return compared to traditional shoe models.According to data he collated, between 30 and 38 athletes competing in NCAA Division I indoor track races ran sub-four-minute miles each year between 2015 and 2021; that figure has increased about three-fold over the past two years to 90 in 2022 and 97 in 2023, he says.Thompson believes current performances are skewed by modern shoe technology and prefers to focus on the competitive aspect of races, rather than the time.“Athletics is a simple sport,” he says. “It’s about who can jump the highest, who can run the fastest over whatever distance, who can throw the furthest. And the technology behind it doesn’t really matter.”Sieg Lindstrom, the editor of Track and Field News, said the outlet stopped updating its list of four-minute-mile debutantes in January but relented a few weeks later after “a raft of negative commentary on social media.”“Give the audience what they want,” Lindstrom tells CNN Sport.He adds, though, that modern shoe technology has “changed the game” – thanks to the spikes mile runners wear in races, as well as the road shoes they wear for training.“Workout performances are faster and recovery is quicker, allowing athletes to pack in more hard training with less risk of injury or overtraining,” says Lindstrom.“From coaches and other long-time observers, I’m hearing estimates of four to five seconds of aid over a mile … I also believe some athletes are ‘super adapters’ to the shoes and due to stride mechanics get more help from the shoes than do others.”Acknowledging that shoes are “a huge factor” in the assault on the four-minute barrier, Lindstrom also points to modern indoor tracks, many of which are engineered specifically to stage big races and produce fast times.Take, for example, New Balance’s recently-opened indoor track facility in Boston, which has banked lanes to encourage fast running. Boston University’s banked track and The Armoury in New York City, popular hunting grounds for four-minute-mile hopefuls, also lay claim to being some of the fastest tracks in the world.Tom Jordan, who spent 37 years as the race director of the Prefontaine Classic track meet in Eugene, says track surfaces make an “incremental” difference to running times compared with modern shoe technology, which he sees as “almost entirely responsible for the huge improvement in times.”“I think that what you have is a situation where the value of the sub-four-minute mile will be so diminished,” Jordan tells CNN Sport. “It’ll take 10 years, but it won’t rate a mention in meet summaries or meet stories.”Today, judging by the online response to Track and Field News’ decision to no longer chronicle four-minute miles, the marker is still worth recognizing for many observers.That’s perhaps testament to the mile’s enduring legacy – even if a sub-four-minute time is unlikely ever to be met with the same fanfare as when Bannister collapsed across the finish line in Oxford nearly 70 years ago. It’s also a sign of the way athletic disciplines develop – just as the introduction of fiberglass or carbon fiber poles enabled pole vaulters to jump greater heights.“Everything moves on,”1,500-meter world champion Jake Wightman told The Independent in a 2021 interview. “If you’re arguing we shouldn’t wear these spikes, are you arguing we should never have changed from leather spikes with nails in the bottom running on cinder tracks?”“There are always going to be developments in technology across the sport … It’s always going to keep moving forward.”According to Jordan, the Prefontaine Classic had more sub-four-minute miles than any other track meet in the world – something he looks back on with pride. However, he predicts it won’t be too long before we revise what’s considered a “fast” time in the distance.“What may well happen is that it will become so common that eventually the athletics public will catch up and say, ‘Okay, well, four minutes doesn’t really mean that much, but 3:50 is still a very good goal,’” says Jordan.“There may be new benchmarks that are established in terms of what constitutes the supreme challenge.”",sport,0.0
304,328,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/golf/slow-play-golf-controversy-cantlay-fitzpatrick-spt-intl/index.html,Tee-k Tock: The ‘appalling’ slow play controversy riling golf’s biggest stars,2023-05-04 10:08:00,"There’s a lot you can do in just under three minutes.You can listen to “Speed of Life” by David Bowie, you can re-live Usain Bolt’s 100m world record run 18 times, and, if you are an exceptionally talented Premier League footballer, you can even squeeze in a hat-trick.Alternatively, you can watch a golfer hit a single ball.That was the situation one fan found himself in at the RBC Heritage last month, as he fired up the stopwatch on his iPhone to time Patrick Cantlay lining up a shot during the final round of the PGA Tour event.When the American eventually swung, the clock was ticking past two minutes and 50 seconds.In Cantlay’s defense, the video wasn’t without caveats. It was an awkward looking lie, the ball lodged in the rough behind a tree, and – with the timer at 90 seconds when first shown – it is impossible to know exactly how long the world No. 4 spent over his shot.The problem for Cantlay, however, is that it was not an isolated incident – nor the most disgruntled reaction.Footage of the golfer spending close to a minute standing over a four-foot putt that same day quickly found its way to the satirical side of the sport’s Twitter community, which spliced the pictures with the closing scenes of the golf comedy classic “Happy Gilmore.”The titular character calculated and sunk his winning championship putt – one that bounced off the windshield of a car and careened leisurely around the debris of a collapsed tower – before Cantlay holed his effort, a tweet from parody account Tour Golf showed.A week prior during the deciding round of The Masters, Cantlay had been playing ahead of the leading group, Brooks Koepka and soon-to-be champion Jon Rahm.Koepka, whose frustrations with slow play lit the touchpaper of a fiery feud with rival Bryson DeChambeau in 2019, made no secret of his grievances.“The group in front of us were brutally slow,” Koepka told reporters.“Jon went to the bathroom like seven times during the round, and we were still waiting.”Yet Koepka’s comments paled in comparison to those made by one of Cantlay’s playing partners during that decisive round at the RBC Heritage, Matt Fitzpatrick. The Englishman went on to lift the title, seeing off Jordan Spieth in a playoff, but did not leave Hilton Head fully satisfied.For Fitzpatrick, regarded as one of the fastest players on the tour, a three-ball round should never take longer than four and a half hours. To get near that is a “disgrace,” to go well past it is “truly appalling.”“The problem is this conversation has gone on for years and years and years, and no one has ever done anything, so I feel it’s almost a waste of time talking about it,” Fitzpatrick told Sky Sports.“I have strong opinions, but no one’s going to do anything about it. It’s like hitting your head against a brick wall. No one ever gets penalized.“I think it’s a real issue, way more needs to be done. The thing is I really like referees over here, they are great people, but I did not see a single ref all day. There were a few shots we were waiting and I don’t understand where they are all hiding. It does become frustrating when you are waiting so long.”Further complaints came from beyond the confines of the PGA Tour.Responding to the video of the fan timing Cantlay on Twitter, former LPGA pro Anya Alvarez labeled it “atrocious.”“What is the point of having a pace of play rule if you’re going to allow this? I was penalized on LPGA for slow play … and it forced me to speed up,” Alvarez said.And even the game’s greatest are weighing in, with Jack Nicklaus and Annika Sörenstam both admitting that the PGA Tour have a problem on their hands.“It’s got to be equitable, but they need to make an example and stay with it,” Nicklaus told Golfweek ahead of the PGA Tour of Champions’ Greats of Golf event on Saturday.“It’s not very pleasant to watch somebody stand over the ball for half an hour.”Sörenstam added: “Nobody enjoys it and it’s not fair, we’re running out of time. Time is a precious commodity, so I think start at the very beginning and teach them to hit when you’re ready and go.“The more we think, the more complicated it gets, so just hit and go.”For Golf Digest analysts Joel Beall, Alex Myers and Luke Kerr-Dineen, there was a general consensus for Fitzpatrick’s outburst: blunt, but true.As well as having a negative “ripple effect” on groups behind the slow player – akin to the chain reaction of braking causing traffic jams on a highway – it could also lead to the Tour losing valuable eyes.“Pace of play is an issue and has been for years,” Beall told CNN Sport.“What’s changed is that sports leagues are recognizing their consumers don’t have an infinite amount of time to devote to their fandoms and are adjusting accordingly. That golf hasn’t has amplified the existing problem.”However, Cantlay seems unfazed. After dropping in a sensational hole-in-one during the second round of the RBC Heritage, the American tweeted video of his effort with the caption: “Playing faster!”Quizzed on Fitzpatrick’s criticisms ahead of the following week’s Zurich Classic, Cantlay said his tenure on the PGA Tour’s Player Advisory Council (PAC) had shown him that round times had been relatively similar across the last decade.“So trying to speed it up, I’d be curious to know how they’d want to do that,” Cantlay told reporters.“I played the last two tournaments, and my group hasn’t been warned at all … I don’t know how you would want the groups that I’ve been in to play faster when our groups are in position and can’t go faster because the group in front of us is right in front of us.“I’m definitely slower than average, have been my whole career. I definitely take my time … I haven’t had anybody come up to me or talk to me, but I’d be perfectly happy to talk to them about it.”Cantlay was speaking alongside fellow American Xander Schauffele, who defended his compatriot.“All the things that have happened as of late have all been within the guidelines of the Tour and what’s supposed to happen,” Schauffele said.“No one’s been penalized for slow play or anything of that nature, so we’re all operating within the framework of what the Tour gives us. If enough people complain or if enough Tour pros complain, that’s something the Tour needs to address to either make it faster or change the time par.“We’re not playing like the local muni [municipal course] that the average Joe compares our time par to – we’re playing for a couple million. If you’re going to spend an extra minute to make sure you put yourself in the right spot, we’re going to do it.”Ironically, the PGA Tour’s Tournament Regulations handbook spends a lot of time on pace of play guidelines.An entire chapter dedicated to the issue begins by citing the R&A and USGA’s Rules of Golf guidance that “a round of golf is meant to be played at a prompt pace.” That pace is set at 40 seconds to play a stroke, with an extra 10 seconds afforded under various circumstances, such as the first player to play a shot on a par-3 hole or on the green respectively.“The player should usually be able to play more quickly than that and is encouraged to do so,” the guidelines state, with golfers that exceed 40 seconds – AKA “bad time” – “informed as soon as practicable” by a tournament official.While the first “bad time” offense goes unpunished, one- and two-stroke penalties are awarded for second and third violations respectively. A fourth offense during a round warrants disqualification. A second “bad time” equals a fine of $50,000, with a $20,000 fine for each subsequent offense.Players that average more than 45 seconds a stroke over a 10-tournament rolling period are notified that they have been put on The Observation List, putting them under direct scrutiny from the Rules Committee. Observed golfers must play each stroke in under 60 seconds.Should a player spend more than two minutes on a shot without a valid excuse, they are hit with an Excessive Shot Time. While the first offense goes unpunished, subsequent breaks put the golfer on The Observation List and are penalized by a monetary fine, starting at $10,000.Both The Observation List and Excessive Shot Time were introduced by the PGA Tour in April 2020 to help speed up the pace of the game.“You talk to players, read articles, hear from fans and what gets people, what gnaws at them, are these individual habits that people have,” then-PGA Tour chief of operations Tyler Dennis told Sky Sports.“It’s seen as bad etiquette. It’s seen as a distraction, and we’re targeting those individual moments to help their fellow competitors and assist our media partners with presentation.“We want to keep the focus where it should be: on world-class shot-making.”So how do you solve a problem like slow play?One idea, floated by PGA Tour golfer Michael Kim, is to name and shame via a monthly report of the slowest players.This was a strategy tested by 2010 Ryder Cup winner Edoardo Molinari in 2019, as the Italian – having voiced his frustration with the pace of play on the European Tour – fulfilled his promise of sharing a spreadsheet documenting the slowest golfers on the Tour via Twitter.Arguably the most commonly suggested solution, however, is the adoption of a shot clock, akin to those used in both the NBA and Major League Baseball (even if the latter’s recent introduction has led to considerable confusion among players).The European Tour trialed the move at The Shot Clock Masters in 2018, dishing out red cards and one-shot penalties for violations, with players afforded two “time-outs” during each round.However, Kerr-Dineen believes a golfing shot clock would be “too messy” to enforce. Instead, he says the PGA Tour should take inspiration from the American Junior Golf Association, where the introduction of “time par” checkpoints every three holes has helped speed up the youngsters’ game.“Each group has to reach the next checkpoint in a specified amount of time. A slow group gets two warnings, then players get a one-stroke penalty for each bad time after that,” Kerr-Dineen explained.“It’s a simple to understand, proven system – and it works.”Golf Digest’s Beall sees some value in shot clocks and public calling outs, but squares responsibility with those that decide where to position the hole.“Those in charge of setting up the course on a weekly basis continue to put pin locations in tough spots on greens that are faster than they’ve ever been,” Beall said.“Put the pins in less severe spots and slow the greens down just a touch could go a ways in alleviating the issue.”And for Myers, the answer has been staring the PGA Tour in the face all this time: simply enforce the existing rules.It has been 28 years since the last slow play penalty was issued to an individual at a PGA Tour regular event, when Glen Daly received a one-stroke penalty at the 1995 Honda Classic.“We hear all the time about so-and-so being put on the clock. What’s the point of doing that if you’re not going to take the next step?” Myers asked.“Start adding strokes to players’ scores and you’ll quickly see those guys taking time off their pre-shot routines.”Such a change would be music to the ears of Koepka, who in 2019 was so frustrated that he offered himself up to play the role of martyr.“I’ve tried to get put on the clock, but it doesn’t seem to work because nobody will penalize anybody. Even if I take over 40 seconds, penalize me,” Koepka said.“I’ll be the guinea pig, it doesn’t matter. It needs to happen.”",sport,0.0

With one waterfall running straight into another, even a small mistake at the top of the descent can create problems later on.Jackson and his friend Bren Orton became only the fourth and fifth people to ever complete the entire sequence, according to Jackson’s representative, due to the potentially dangerous nature of having such big waterfalls so close together.Rush Struges, Rafa Ortiz, and Evan Garcia were the first people to run the waterfalls from top to bottom in 2013.“It is a very remote spot,” says Jackson, “so you really have to make sure you trust your decision to run it and also the people there to help you.”The 29-year-old Jackson is as comfortable kayaking down an isolated gorge as he is competing internationally, having won four freestyle world championship titles since 2013.Three years ago, he descended the 134-foot Salto del Maule waterfall in Chile, the second-highest waterfall descent in history and an experience he likened to “falling off the face of the earth.”Jackson’s achievements in the sport are perhaps not wholly surprising give his family background. His father, Eric, was an Olympic kayaker and freestyle world champion, while his sister, Emily, has also won world titles.But that doesn’t stop Jackson’s family getting anxious when he embarks on a big project, including his descent in the Santo Domingo Gorge.“My dad’s a pro kayaker, my sister’s a pro kayaker, my mom has been there every step of the way,” says Jackson. “I think especially my mom and my sister in particular, they don’t love when I do the big stuff like this.“I usually just let them know after the fact what’s happened, what I’m doing … They’re always stoked to hear when it goes well.”Amid the dangers presented by Jackson’s latest challenge in the Santo Domingo Gorge was also a reminder of why he fell in love with kayaking in the first place.“To do it well and safely and be at the bottom with your friends?” he says. “There’s nothing like it.”",sport,0.0
306,330,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/football/trans-soccer-team-spt-intl/index.html,The trans soccer team that’s making history,2023-05-04 05:23:00,"Arthur Webber made history this year. On the rainy evening of March 31, 2023, he captained what he says is the first ever all trans masculine soccer team in Europe in a match. Players stepped out onto the pitch in blue and pink patterned kits – the same colors that adorn the trans pride flag.Trans masculine is a term used for people that were assigned female at birth and whose gender identity or expression (or both) is masculine. The umbrella definition includes trans men, non-binary and gender-fluid people.The game was played in front of 500 supporters, fittingly, on Transgender Visibility Day and for the 25-year-old Webber – as someone who gave up football at the age of 13 and only started playing again in 2022 – it was a night he couldn’t have dreamt of as a teenager.“I was quite nervous before the match,” Webber told CNN. “I’ve never been captain before, so it was a responsibility I wasn’t used to. I also knew it was likely that the eyes of transphobes online would be on us when we walked out.“I wanted to make sure we got a decent result and that the guys playing had fun – especially because lots of them hadn’t played football since school. I had to explain the offside rule to a few of them in the changing rooms!”Webber himself didn’t play soccer for 11 years. When he came out as trans as a teenager, he gave the sport up – although he never stopped loving the game.“Once we walked onto the pitch, there was a real sense of pride that we were there and we were doing something special.”The team that played that historic match are part of a club called TRUK United FC – which was formed in January 2021 with the initial goal of raising money for their namesake, Trans Radio UK. They now also aim to make soccer a more inclusive sport and connect the trans community.The manager is Lucy Clark – who the Football Association (FA) says became English soccer’s first trans referee in 2018 – and organized the first ever all trans feminine team in the world, also for TRUK, in 2022.Clark, as manager, has overseen the history-making feats of TRUK United and Webber says it was her that encouraged him to captain the all trans masculine team last month.Trans feminine is an umbrella term that refers to people that were assigned male at birth but identify with femininity. The term includes trans women, non-binary and gender-fluid people.“After the all trans feminine team played their game and once I’d played with the all-gender team, she took me aside and said she’d been thinking about what we could do next and asked if I’d be interested in captaining an all trans masc team,” Webber said.“I thought it was a great idea because in the all-gender team, I was the only trans masc player in that side and there was a need for greater representation for trans men.”Webber put out a call on social media, namely on Twitter, for trans men who want to play soccer and was delighted by the response.Soon, a full 11-a-side team had assembled and it even included a British TV star – Ash Palmisciano plays the first trans character in the long-running soap opera “Emmerdale” and even drove down from Leeds to London just to play the match.The match and the positive reception to it has given Webber hope for the future of trans representation in soccer – at grassroots levels and beyond. Right now though, Webber doesn’t think the sport is doing enough.At the moment, Webber says, soccer is not trans inclusive. “Even in amateur LGBTQ leagues, the teams are mostly made up of cisgender gay men – there is a lack of trans people. I can count on one hand the number of trans people I know that play in LGBTQ clubs,” he said.Webber says consideration for trans people can often be an afterthought in soccer.“For example, sometimes clubs will book venues where there are only two changing rooms – one for each team that’s playing but if you have people of multiple genders on one team, [such as on mixed gender soccer teams] they might not want to get changed in the same room as everyone else in the squad,” explained Webber.He feels that grassroots soccer, including LGBTQ clubs, still has a lot to learn, and so do the top clubs – such as those in the Premier League.When Webber stopped playing soccer after coming out as trans, he also stopped following the sport – which meant, for many years, he did not keep up with his beloved Arsenal. He said it simply “hurt too much” to watch soccer while he felt like he couldn’t play.Now, he is involved with the North London club’s LGBTQ fan group – Gay Gooners – and attends games at the Emirates stadium. But he stresses that there is still more to be done by top clubs for their trans supporters:“They are trying. I’ve done a lot of work with Arsenal over the years and the big clubs have come some way in including their trans fans,” Webber said to CNN.“But what we really need is trans people in the rooms where decisions are made. There has to be someone there that’s actually affected by these issues to tell you what’s needed.”A statement on Arsenal’s website reads: “Over the years, Arsenal in the Community has taken an active role in providing LGBTQ+ education and tackling homophobia. Our community team are trained by Stonewall to deliver LGBTQ+ awareness sessions to staff and community groups.”The historic all trans masc match that took place on March 31st came at a particularly difficult time for trans athletes.World Athletics recently banned some trans women from competing in female track and field events, pending a new review of their rules. In June 2022, the global governing body for rugby league banned transgender women from playing in women’s international matches.In the same month, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to approve a new policy that restricts most transgender athletes from competing in elite women’s aquatics competitions.In April 2022, British Cycling banned trans and non-binary riders from competition.Many trans people feel excluded from sport at the moment.In a recent exclusive interview with CNN, trans runner CeCe Telfer said she felt “devastation” for herself and “for many around the world” when World Athletics made its announcement in March. But Telfer made clear that she wouldn’t be deterred from running.“There’s a place for each and every one of us and I know where I belong,” Telfer told CNN’s Amanda Davies. “I just want the world to know that.”And as things are getting tougher for trans athletes around the world, daily life, too, is getting harder for trans people – especially in the UK.In January, the UK government blocked a new law passed by the devolved Scottish Parliament and intended to allow trans people in Scotland to change their legal gender without a medical diagnosis.The then First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, subsequently called the intervention “a full-frontal attack on our democratically elected Scottish Parliament and its ability to make its own decisions on devolved matters,” in a post on Twitter.During the race for the Conservative Party leadership, now-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to protect “women’s rights,” in a Twitter post, and attached a link to an article in which an unnamed Sunak ally was quoted as saying the lawmaker was “critical of recent trends to erase women via the use of clumsy, gender-neutral language,” in reference to language that is meant to be inclusive of trans and non-binary people in addition to cisgender women.Just weeks ago, Sunak pledged to publish new government guidance on whether teachers should inform parents when a child questions their own gender identity.In April, the Guardian and Dazed reported that Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch is considering amending the 2010 UK Equality Act to redefine “sex” to refer specifically to a person’s sex assigned at birth – a move that would make it legal to ban transgender people from “single-sex” spaces that match a trans person’s gender identity.In a letter to Badenoch, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said the UK government should “consider the potential implications of this change” and recommended detailed policy and legal analysis be undertaken “in compliance with the Public Sector Equality Duty and with due regard to any possible disadvantages for trans men and trans women.”When it comes to trans representation in English soccer, Webber hopes that the FA won’t follow suit with other sport governing bodies and ban trans people from competing: “I hope the FA won’t cave to pressure from internet trolls and transphobes. I just hope they do what’s right.”In a statement, the FA told CNN: “Our transgender policy has enabled many positive outcomes for people who wish to enjoy and play football either in their affirmed gender or in a safe and inclusive environment.“This important subject is complex and is constantly evolving, and as a result, like many other national governing bodies in sport, we are currently reviewing our transgender policy for English football.”What Webber hopes the future of soccer holds is a space for visible trans players. Whether that’s in the National League, League One, the Championship or even the Premier League.“I hope that young trans people playing football right now know there’s a place for them in the sport and, so, they won’t give it up,” he said. “And maybe in the next generation, there will be a trans player at the top level. Maybe, in ten years or so, we’ll get there and that would be just amazing to see.”Webber thinks his young self would have barely been able to believe the achievement TRUK made just last month: “To play in an all trans masc team, in a match against a team of cisgender people, that just wouldn’t have been conceivable to me at 13.”“I am becoming the visibility I didn’t have when I was a kid.”Webber knows it is going to take time for soccer to be completely trans inclusive and expressed his admiration for TRUK manager Lucy Clark for being a visible driving force in trans representation in the game.“She puts her head above the parapet time and time again,” he said. “And that is incredibly brave. It really sucks that, in order to push for greater trans inclusivity in sport, someone has to make themselves visible to everyone and know that they might face abuse because of that. But she is willing to take that risk just to ensure trans people are being considered in football.”Webber, above all, is determined to ensure that no one feels excluded from soccer: “I want trans people who’ve never played football to know that this is a sport for them.”“This is just the start,” he said. “One day, there’ll be hundreds of trans people playing football all over the country at all levels.”",sport,0.0
307,331,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/28/football/wrexham-ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney-impact-spt-intl/index.html,Wrexham: An intoxicating tale of Hollywood glamor and sporting romance,"09:41 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","“It’s an underdog story,” says Gene Warman, an Ohio native sitting in a bar with his son in a city neither had heard of this time last year. “It’s a wonderful thing.”Warman and his 22-year-old son Andrew are on a four-day trip from the US to watch their new-found love, Wrexham AFC. They flew into London the previous day and embarked on a four-hour, 183-mile drive to the northeast of Wales. Jetlag cannot be countenanced on a sacred trip such as this.In an often brutal and bleak world, the recent resurgence of Wrexham, the city as well as the soccer club, lifts the soul. Tourists smile when asked for their thoughts on this small industrial city near the English-Welsh border, brought to the world’s attention by the soccer club’s owners, actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.Locals have always loved talking about their club, the beating heart of this working-class community, but now there’s a confidence and, crucially, optimism, when doing so.In loaning the club their money – over £3 million ($3.7 million) according to the club’s accounts – and the offshoots of their fame, Reynolds and McElhenney have brought hope to a city and its people. The future is exciting when you’re no longer fighting for survival.Grey clouds cocoon the city on the eve of the biggest match in the club’s recent history. The nearby mountains contributing to the rain threat that never materializes. It is not an April day for the outdoors, but a perfect one for what has arguably become the most well-known pub in Wales, the No. 1 stop on the Wrexham tourist trail.The Warmans have yet to venture into the center of the city, instead heading first to the Turf, a pub where the club was founded.Those who have watched “Welcome to Wrexham,” the TV documentary which follows the owners’ 2021 takeover and first season in charge, need no explanation as to why this pub a few steps away from the main entrance of the stadium is a must-see for visitors.From the first episode, landlord Wayne Jones and his customers are held as an example of how Wrexham AFC is woven into the fabric of people’s lives.The pub looks much like it does on television: the food van in the parking lot, the painted red-brick wall with fans’ signatures, framed football shirts and other soccer memorabilia hanging from walls and pictures of Reynolds and McElhenney dotted around.What has changed, as is the case for a lot of businesses in the city, is that there are more customers than ever. Trade has, Jones says, “practically doubled” since the documentary was first aired. A city that was struggling economically, especially when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, is now, he says, thriving.“I dread to think where we would’ve been had Ryan and Rob not come in,” says Jones, a man who has become accustomed to interviews, this being his fourth of a day that has just become afternoon.The Turf is full of life, locals mixing with tourists who want to drink at the pub they know from the show. Jones, a season ticket holder, says he scoffed at warnings from McElhenney to prepare for tourists once the documentary was aired. “As much as I love this town, we are just a small industrial town in northeast Wales,” he says. “But they’ve nailed it.”Standing at the bar, sipping beers bought for them by a regular, are Los Angeles-based businessmen Rajat Bhattacharya and Arun Mahtani. The pair have tickets to watch Liverpool play the next day and felt they had to visit Wrexham. At a table a few meters away are husband and wife Thania and Jeff LaMirand from Washington, making Wrexham part of a short trip to Europe which will also encompass a few days in Madrid, Spain. There are no longer run-of-the-mill days at the Turf.Jones says on a quiet day about 20 to 30 tourists visit the pub. “It’s every day, without fail,” he says, breaking out into a disbelieving smile.“It’s a bit bonkers that we’re getting people from Colorado and Texas. There are five chaps just walked in now from Alabama. There’s a guy on the plane over from Alabama.“The people that I’ve spoken to have said they fell in love with the documentary.“The majority of them said they fell in love with the community, and it’s quite clever from Robert and Ryan because they could have just made another pure football documentary … But they focused on the town and Rob said to me, ‘I knew that if I could get Americans to see the town, they could relate to the people and then they’d want to be a part of it.’ And that’s exactly what’s happened.”Wales was conquered by England in the 13th century, but the two countries would not be united politically until the 16th century.It is a long, sometimes bloody history; 200 years of English invasions and Welsh revolts before the country was completely conquered and, though peaceful for hundreds of years, the relationship between the two neighbors is still complicated. They are different countries sharing common laws, friends for the most part despite cultural differences, yet like for many a once conquered nation, the past is not forgotten.For north Walians, there is an added twist. Not only have they often felt a shadow looming over them from the bigger, more powerful neighbor to the east, but a disconnect with compatriots in the south, too.There is a sense that the focus has always been on the south, almost everything is there: the capital city (Cardiff), the Senedd (the Welsh Parliament), the national stadium, the country’s two biggest cities and, in fact, most of the population. And there is no major highway from Cardiff to north Wales, just a winding trunk highway – an often-beautiful route, but not a quick one.But now, there’s Wrexham with a story that, in hindsight, feels as if it was just waiting for Hollywood. The oldest soccer club in Wales, the third-oldest professional club in the world, saved from the brink by its fans; the club that was once in the higher echelons of the English football league system before it tumbled into the fifth tier of the English game, its fortunes taking a downturn both on and off the pitch. Then came Reynolds and McElhenney, with money, a plan and stardust.“The searchlight has changed,” says Elen-Mai Nefydd, head of Welsh medium academic development at the city’s university, named after the medieval Welsh nationalist leader Owain Glyndwr.“There hadn’t been much interest in us [the area], to the point where lots of people who live in Wrexham in the past would have preferred to say, ‘I live in northeast Wales, not far from Chester’ … to the point where people would almost bypass the name.”Nefydd talks of there being an “energy” among the locality, mainly thanks to the soccer club, but also because of the city status given to Wrexham in 2022, plans to redevelop the city center and the “Wrexham Gateway project,” which aims to regenerate an area of the city that includes building a new stand at the club’s Racecourse Ground, which will increase the stadium’s capacity to over 15,000.“There’s a proudness around saying now that you’re from Wrexham and that’s a huge shift, isn’t it, to be in a position where you’ve almost masked where you’re from to being proud of where you live and work,” she says.A Welsh speaker, Nefydd talks passionately about the language, which is spoken by nearly 30% of the population, according to the 2022 Annual Population Survey (APS), which is around 900,600 people.Throughout the documentary, soccer terminology is explained in English, American English and Welsh. One episode solely focuses on Wales’ history, all of which, says Nefydd, has “highlighted the importance of the language” and contributed to an “exceptional” confidence in the country for its language and culture.“What Rob and Ryan have done is they’ve opened people’s eyes to the fact that we are not a dying language,” she says. “We’re a language that’s alive. People socialize in Welsh, they are educated in Welsh, we work in Welsh. If it takes two Hollywood stars to do that, then fantastic.”Mark Griffiths is an English teacher and for nearly 40 years has been commentating on Wrexham games in his spare time. His voice can be heard on matchdays via the club’s website, and features in the podcast, ‘Final Whistle,’ and the local radio station, Calon FM.For years, Griffiths has been overseeing the hashtag ‘Ask Wrexham’ ‘#askwxm’ on Twitter to generate interaction with listeners. For the most part, the same diehard 20 fans would take part, he says, and on matchdays there would be no questions at all because everyone would be at the match. But now, times have changed.“The hashtag is completely out of control,” the 54-year-old says, explaining that he struggles to answer all the questions he receives even after introducing a one-hour weekly podcast specifically for that purpose.It will come as no surprise to read that Griffiths has featured in “Welcome to Wrexham.” In 18 episodes, the show has managed to get viewers “hooked” on the city, he says, describing the show as McElhenney’s “hymn to the working class.”“There was a concern … ‘Will we be made to look stupid?’ You know, the big-time guys coming in from civilization and pat the cave dwellers on their heads and save them and we all look like fools, and they haven’t,” he says.Griffiths was a member of the Wrexham Supporters’ Trust which helped raise money to stop the club from going out of business. He was one of the 98.4% who overwhelmingly voted in favor of the American-Canadian takeover.When Reynolds and McEllhenney put forward their proposal to the trust, Griffiths says they talked about having stewardship of the club, rather than ownership. They used, he says, “the right language.”“I’m very cynical,” says Griffiths. “I like the idea of fan ownership. I like the idea that we don’t end up at the whim of one or two wealthy people. But this is that rare occasion that they are just clearly in it for the right reasons.“I feel strongly about fans being the only people you can trust with a club, but these guys are for real. They’re amazing.”In the shadow of the Racecourse Ground is the city’s university campus and, every Friday evening, its sports center is bustling. Spirits are high tonight and laughter fills the air; coaches are yelling orders, sometimes they tease when a challenge doesn’t go quite to plan. Three coaches scoot around the perimeters of the court, chasing balls which go out of bounds, as the players, who are all in electric wheelchairs, move around at quite some speed.These are weekly sessions which have been made possible because of investment from the club.Kerry Evans, Wrexham AFC’s disability liaison officer, is on the sidelines every week, overseeing a junior and adult team. When the powerchair teams were formed last August, Evans had intended to play, but there is too much to organize, she says; always a call to make, or a ringing phone to pick up, questions to answer, plans to be made.The owners were, Evans says, “very prominent” in setting up powerchair football in the city and it has, she says, transformed lives.“We’ve got players that come that say it’s what gets them up on a Friday,” she says.Evans jokes she is the club’s go-to person for media interviews because, she says, her role is wholly positive. She became a full-time employee at the club last March but prior to that had been volunteering for about six-and-a-half years, doing what she does now, which is making the stadium more accessible and welcoming for people with disabilities.Wrexham is the first club in Wales to fund a powerchair team, says Evans. Playing on an indoor court, a team consists of four players – a goalkeeper, a defender, a midfielder and an attacker – and they compete using a larger ball than your typical soccer ball, while goalposts are two upright posts six meters apart.Caio Jones is a 22-year-old wheelchair user from Bangor, a city in the northwest of the country, about 69 miles from Wrexham, or a 70-minute journey one way. He is one of a few in the group who is ready to play competitively from next season.For 12 months, Evans investigated the feasibility of bringing powerchair to Wrexham before making a proposal to the club’s board. Once approved, the club’s community trust coaches had to be trained, and chairs needed to be purchased. New, each chair – which have bumpers at the front to allow players to travel with the ball – costs about $5,000 to $7,500, says Evans.“Rob and Ryan offered brand new chairs, which I did turn down in the beginning … I felt we really needed to prove that this was going to take off and be a thing,” she says. “We’re now struggling to keep up with the level of demand with the chairs that we need. It’s grown and grown.”It is quite the change from the early 2000s when there were fears the club would be evicted from its stadium, or nearly 12 years ago when the Racecourse Ground and training facilities were sold to the university and fans raised more than £100,000 (almost $162,000 at August 2011’s exchange rate) in a day to save the club.“I was around when fans were bringing in deeds to their houses to keep our club alive … without those people many years ago, we wouldn’t have a club now to even be discussed with Hollywood owners,” says Evans.No one speaks negatively about Reynolds and McElhenney because their investment has made a difference; to the women’s team which was promoted this season to the Welsh first division, to the fans in wheelchairs who can now go to some away games thanks to a wheelchair accessible bus the club provides, to families of children with autism who have a quiet zone in the stadium available to them on matchdays.“Wrexham football club would not have survived Covid due to the fan ownership,” says Evans. “Reading about people losing their business all across the UK [because of the impact of the pandemic] and Wrexham suddenly had this hope and excitement about it.“We were one of the luckiest towns, as it was then, to come out of Covid with so much to look forward to, and both owners brought that to our town.”Finally. Forty-four games into the season, and today is the day Wrexham could get promoted. No club has been stuck in the National League for longer. Fifteen often dreary years in the fifth tier; some nearly-there seasons, some never-come-close seasons.Five times Wrexham has qualified for the playoffs since 2011 but each occasion ended in failure, which explains why seeds of doubt are hard for some to rid. But Wrexham should beat its opponent Boreham Wood at home, which would secure automatic promotion and the league title.“Being an old-school Wrexham fan, I can’t get too carried away, I’ve seen a lot of disappointments over the years,” says Rob Clarke, the owner of mad4movies and another who features in the documentary.Clarke’s DVD shop is in the city’s market hall. About 10 stalls are in business – selling dog food, sweets, plastic flowers and such – while the rest are empty. There is a sadness to a silent shopping quarter on a Saturday afternoon. Not everywhere in the city can thrive.Clarke says he could make more money in another line of work, but over the last 17 years in business, his shop has become a hub for anyone wanting to talk about Wrexham AFC, and there’s nothing he loves doing more than that. “Usually put the world to rights on a Monday morning after the weekend results,” he says.The documentary was first aired last year, and Clarke is still struggling to come to terms with its impact. “It’s crazy,” he says with a shake of the head and a smile.“I’ve had people taking pictures of this place … Not even I take a picture of this place!” he says. “People are coming from all over, the American fans coming in and they’ve bought the DVDs. They know they can’t play them over there because it’s a different format, but they want a souvenir or something.”Magic can happen under floodlights. A pitch becomes a stage, providing vivid color to a dark night. Bright lights, big emotions. The atmosphere crackles.Wrexham is leading 3-1, the silence that greeted Boreham Wood’s first-minute goal long since replaced by over 10,000 delirious, singing fans. One delivers his farewell soliloquy to what he calls this “awful, awful, league,” with a few expletives thrown in for punctuation.Five minutes into stoppage time and fans are rising to their feet, increasing the decibels, preparing for the full-time roar. And then the whistle blows.Thousands pour onto the pitch, even though they were warned not to before kick-off. The heart rules during an intoxicating hit to the senses such as this. Players disappear in the red mist of flares; some are carried on the shoulders of fans, and joyful chaos ensues.The pitch is now a metaphorical therapy couch, years of frustration and disappointment released and replaced with ecstasy.Cameras capture McElhenney crying in the stands. Reynolds embraces his friend, a moment captured by Paul Rudd, the star of Marvel’s “Ant-Man” franchise, another Hollywood A-lister visiting the city. McElhenney would later say he “blacked out” during that moment.The pair later joined the team on the pitch, jumping as if they were on pogo sticks when the trophy was lifted. Promotion to League Two achieved and done in style – over 100 points accumulated in a season for the first time in the club’s history, an unbeaten campaign at home, more than 100 goals scored and a record number of points collected in a single National League season.And for the first time since 1988, four Welsh clubs will now play in England’s football league, with these clubs competing in the English system by virtue of the Welsh football league system having not been created when they were founded.An end of a chapter, but not the story.In its 158-year existence, the club has experienced nothing quite like these last two years. An unprecedented 24,000 of this season’s shirts sold by last December, turnover soaring, global sales accounting for 80% of merchandise sold. A (now former) National League team with a worldwide following. And not a negative to report, other than the £2.91 million ($3.61m) in losses for the year to June 2022, Reynolds and McElhenney’s first full season in charge.Wrexham’s owners have charmed the city and its inhabitants and, in turn, the earthiness of the city’s people and their passion for the club has captivated, seduced almost, the rest of the world.Celebrity combined with sporting romance is a heady mix. Season Two and League Two lie ahead.",sport,0.0
308,332,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/27/football/taras-stepanenko-ruslan-malinovskyi-ukraine-footballers-spt-intl/index.html,‘I was scared about my family:’ Why two Ukrainian footballers keep playing despite Russia’s invasion,"09:41 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Ukrainian soccer player Taras Stepanenko still remembers the intense fear he felt as he heard the sound of gunfire and explosions during the initial days of Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine.The 33-year-old was hiding in a basement in Kyiv with his family as Russian troops approached the city.“You’re just a footballer, you have three kids and a wife and you don’t know what to do. You don’t know what to do if Russian troops come to your house,” Stepanenko told CNN Sport.“It’s very difficult for me, as a man who wanted to support his family. I was scared about my family, I really didn’t know what to do in that specific situation.”Stepanenko had been at his family home when he learned about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the early morning of February 24, 2022.That date is seared into Stepanenko’s memory as the day that his life, and the lives of millions across Ukraine, changed forever.Amid all the chaos and confusion, Stepanenko decided that his family would be safer hiding in the basement of their home.They spent three days sheltering, unsure of what their fate would be, before eventually escaping the nation’s capital.The family moved south to get away from the fighting before eventually leaving the country and moving to Moldova, then Romania, before finally settling in Spain.“I really felt relieved when we moved from Kyiv,” Stepanenko said as he spoke to CNN in London ahead of Ukraine’s Euro 2024 qualifier against England in March.It’s been over a year since the start of the war, which shows no sign of ending.The devastation has only truly been revealed in the aftermath of Russia’s retreat from areas north of the capital city of Kyiv and parts of southern and eastern Ukraine. The names of towns like Bucha and Irpin have become synonymous with Russian atrocities and alleged war crimes.The fighting still continues, with parts of eastern and southern Ukraine suffering nearly nonstop assaults from Russian forces.Against that backdrop, Stepanenko is grateful to have escaped, courtesy of special conditions granted to him as a father of three children and also as a professional athlete.But the imposing midfielder, who has played 72 times for his country, doesn’t take that privilege for granted and knows he’s been more fortunate than most.It’s why he’s now dedicated his life and career to raising awareness of Ukraine’s fight – the softly spoken Stepanenko sees it as his national duty to do so and says he’s spoken to countless journalists from across the world.His determination to speak on behalf of his compatriots and keep Ukraine in the news agenda is also partly driven by a call from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the country’s athletes to represent Ukraine on the global stage, urging them to keep raising awareness of the issues facing their compatriots back home.“All people in Ukraine have a duty for the country, guys my age are soldiers and volunteers, they help in hospitals or are teachers,” Stepanenko tells CNN.“I’m a footballer, so what can I do for my country? The best I can do is represent my country as a player […] and send the message to European countries and tell our story through football,” adds Stepanenko, who speaks so calmly about the devastating topic of war.In addition to representing his country, Stepanenko is proud to play for Shakhtar Donetsk, which is one of Ukraine’s biggest clubs.He joined the club in 2010 and has since played over 200 times, winning eight league titles. But playing for the team means Stepanenko has lived a peripatetic existence.When Russia forcefully annexed Crimea in 2014 and fighting between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian army broke out in eastern Ukraine, Shakhtar was forced out of its home in the Donbas region. The club has been on the move ever since.Without a permanent home, the demand on the club’s squad has been relentless, with travel and logistics taking a heavy toll on players, staff and supporters alike.“I’m more motivated to play football, not just as a footballer, but as someone who has a duty for his country,” he added, when asked how he’s been able to focus on sport.“Every match I take part in, for Shakhtar or the national team, I always say to the younger guys […] that it’s our duty to do our best to represent our country.“To give the message that the Ukrainian people are strong. They are fighting on every field: sports, politics and the battlefield.”Whether playing for their clubs or the national team, it impossible for Ukraine’s players to escape the war.Many start each morning by checking social media, news channels and air-raid apps which tell them about the most recent strikes to hit the country.That’s been the unenviable reality for Ukrainian midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi for over a year.The 29-year-old was playing for Italian club Atalanta when he heard about Russia’s invasion and was preparing to play a Europa League match against Greek side Olympiacos that evening.The midfielder spent the day on the phone to friends and family, ensuring his loved ones were safe. Then while struggling to come to terms with the new reality, Malinovskyi says he was asked by the coaching staff whether he could play. His answer was never in doubt.“Of course, I said yes,” Malinovskyi, who is now on loan at French club Marseille, tells CNN Sport.Despite his mind being occupied by the escalating violence back home, Malinovskyi not only played against Olympiacos but scored two goals in the 3-0 win – his second an astonishing effort from long distance.When celebrating his first goal, Malinovskyi lifted up his jersey to reveal a message on his undershirt which read: “No War In Ukraine.”It was a moment that reverberated around the world.“Every day, I think about how it’s possible in 2022 and 2023 that war is still possible. Some other country trying to take some part of another country,” he says.“I want to say thank you to all the countries who support Ukraine, and we do our best to make peace in the world. That’s how it should be.”Malinovskyi has seen how the game can play a role in providing respite from the war’s devastating reality.“Football is emotion […] when you work all week, if somebody has stress, somebody has a difficult week, football is where you can put it out,” he says.“It can sometimes make you happy, sometimes make you angry, sometimes sad […] I think that’s why football is the number one sport in the world.”Malinovskyi brushes off concerns that the war has made it harder for him on the pitch and, like many of his national teammates, he’s aware of how fortunate he’s been.Like Stepanenko, he sees playing football as his national duty and a way of repaying those fighting on the frontline.Malinovskyi has also set up a charity alongside his partner which has supplied much needed medical equipment for the children of Ukraine.Both Malinovskyi and Stepanenko will be key members of the Ukrainian national team in its bid to qualify for the European Championships, hosted by Germany, in 2024.The campaign got off to a difficult start after a 2-0 defeat to England at Wembley in March, but the team will look to regroup in time for its next fixtures against North Macedonia and Malta in June.“I’m proud that I’m a Ukrainian and I can represent all players that play in Ukraine,” says Malinovskyi, who has played 52 times for the national team.“For me, a patriot is someone who loves his country and the people in it. The parliament, the president should work for the people, not for himself.“Every person wants to make this country better and, of course, make it happy.”",sport,0.0
309,333,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/29/sport/courtney-dauwalter-ultramarathon-spt-intl/index.html,Courtney Dauwalter: The fun-fueled ultra-marathon star defying science,"09:41 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Most people’s idea of fun wouldn’t involve running for hours on end through brutal, undulating terrain – but ultra-marathon sensation Courtney Dauwalter is no ordinary person.While an ultra-marathon is technically defined as any race longer than 26.2 miles, Dauwalter’s exploits tend to take place at distances far greater than that, usually between 100 to 250 miles.The 38-year-old’s list of achievements is almost interminable. Dauwalter, a four-time ‘Ultra Running Magazine Ultrarunner of the year,’ holds multiple course records for the obscenely long races around the US and abroad.Dauwalter’s breakout moment came at the Moab 240 – an annual 240-mile race in Utah. At the 2017 edition, shortly after making the decision to become a full-time ultra-runner, Dauwalter completed the course a scarcely believable 10 hours ahead of all other competitors – male and female.The Transgrancanaria event on February 24 – Dauwalter’s most recent escapade - resulted in her 15th straight race win by gender dating back to March 2021, according to results database Ultrasignup.The Minnesota native completed the grueling 128km course (79.5 miles) – including over 7000 meters of elevation gain - around the Canary Island in a course record 14 hours 40 minutes: over 90 minutes ahead of her closest competitor.What makes Dauwalter’s success even more remarkable is her approach to the sport. Given the extraordinary distances covered, you might expect her to have a forensic outlook on the craft, with rigorous training schedules, extreme diets, and advanced technology galore.In fact, the opposite is true.“Pre-race I’ll usually go with pizza,” Dauwalter tells CNN Sport. “Pizza is easy to find almost anywhere, it’s predictable, and it’s delicious.“Afterwards I’m often craving a beer and just a huge pile of nachos.”With regards to coaching, Dauwalter believes there is no replacement for intuition. Indeed, she doesn’t even wear a heart rate monitor.“The best way for me to train right now is no coach, no plan, and really just tuning into those signals – physical, mental, emotional,” she says. “Then every day I can assess myself and see where I’m at for the day.“One of the cool parts of this sport is that there’s so many ways people go about training for these races – there is no right or wrong path to completing a 100 or 200-mile race.”On the face of it, Dauwalter’s ultra-marathon supremacy is confusing. Personable, modest, and bearing a disarming grin, it is hardly the image that leaps to mind when one envisages an extreme sport phenomenon.Underneath that smile, however, lies a resolute commitment to mental strength, aided by a particular visualization exercise she created for when the going gets tough: The Pain Cave.“The Pain Cave is the place I go to in my head when it feels like I physically can’t take another step,” Dauwalter explains. “I’m a very visual person, so I’ll picture actually grabbing a chisel and entering this cave in my mind, because oftentimes our bodies are wanting to tap out before we’ve actually reached our limits.”The idea is that, in using the imaginary tool to extend the cave’s depth, Dauwalter is extending her mental capacity to push her boundaries and turning the bodily pain into a productive exercise.“If we can just stay strong in our heads and change our mindset to something useful and positive, we can usually achieve way more than what we initially thought,” she adds.That is not to say that the mind-over-matter approach comes without risk in ultra-marathons.Dauwalter says she once lost her sight completely in the closing phases of a race in 2017 – telling the Rich Roll podcast that for the final 10 miles of a 100-mile race, it was “pure white” in her field of vision.Hallucinations can be a common occurrence when testing human resolve to the limit in ultra-marathons. Andrew Mojica, a former psychology student at the University of Texas, told Trail Runner Magazine in 2017 that “at least a third” of the competitors he studied in 2003’s 135-mile Badwater Race in Death Valley, California, experienced hallucinations.True to character, Dauwalter has a positive and novel method of coping with the unexpected visions.“At first I didn’t know that these hallucinations happened during races – I distinctly remember I was doing a race in Colorado and there were flying eels like bombing towards my head,” she laughs. “And there was a giraffe standing right next to the trail on this, like, Colorado mountain.“Now that I know those things happen, and I might make some friends out there, I’ve just grown to appreciate it – like, ‘what friends might I make on this race?’”A former science teacher herself, Dauwalter’s ongoing success against men and women has catalyzed discussions around the science of biological sex and how it contributes to performance as distance increases.“There’s a lot to learn about what people are capable of in this sport – and specifically a lot to learn about what people are capable of in those races that are 200-plus miles,” Dauwalter explains.“Endurance and strength are factors in running a race, but suddenly in the mix you’ve got the ability to problem solve, mental strength, like, stubbornness is a factor in there or the ability to stay awake.”These less tangible talents are where Dauwalter excels, and the Colorado resident is animated by the prospect of participating in the ongoing learning process around race length.“All these other skills that have nothing to do with muscle size and are skills that really anyone could develop or be naturally good at,” she continues.“So, it will be interesting to see how our understanding of what’s possible develops as we get more and more people doing them (longer races) … and to be a part of that is really exciting.”It feels remiss to describe someone as impressive as Dauwalter as happy-go-lucky given the breadth of her achievements, but she herself is adamant that her enjoyment of the exploits and the problem solving that comes with absurd distance is fundamental to her triumphs.“For me, training, racing and exploring what’s possible with these ultra-races, the really long trail ones, is fun,” Dauwalter says.“And I love pushing my limits and seeing what’s possible – so keeping that as fun as we can is top of the list of importance.”Ultra-marathons’ inbuilt relationship with nature keeps the enjoyment fresh for Dauwalter.“It feels really special to be able to explore in that way, to appreciate how silent it can be in some of those moments and some of those places and not really know what’s coming,” she says.“When you come around a corner on a trail and you have no idea of the huge view you’re going to be rewarded with – it’s such a cool surprise to have.”The ultra-marathon circuit is truly global. In the last year alone, Dauwalter won races in Texas, Cape Town, and the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, and the runner is grateful for the travel opportunities afforded to her by the sport.“I really appreciate exploring these places with my feet,” she says.Dauwalter is too humble to consider ideas of legacy and achievement. She herself is “definitely not keeping track” of her winning run, she says. However, her fame and fanbase continue to grow (at the time of writing, she has 420,000 followers on Instagram).Pressed to contemplate what she would like her impact to be on the sport and beyond, her message is clear: we should all seek to push ourselves more.“In general, I think everyone’s bars are just a little bit too low, and that we should raise the bar for ourselves,” she says. “We should go after the thing that sounds a little bit crazy or sounds a little bit too difficult and just see, because, why not?”Whether that extra exertion comes via her beloved sport is secondary, as far as Dauwalter is concerned.“Yes, I want more people to experience ultrarunning,” she concludes. “I would love people to choose that as their thing that sounds crazy that they want to try. But also, I think people can just do that with anything in their life and see what happens with it.”",sport,0.0
310,334,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/motorsport/lewis-hamilton-miami-formula-one-spt-intl/index.html,From serving drinks to washing cars: Lewis Hamilton on what helped make him a sporting great,2023-05-05 08:12:00,"Lewis Hamilton is one of the greatest sportsmen of his generation, a seven-time world champion and an influential philanthropist. But there was a time when his life wasn’t quite as glamorous.In an interview with CNN Sport’s Coy Wire, Hamilton recollected some of his first jobs: from washing cars and selling sneakers, to serving drinks (badly) in a bar.While the Englishman’s CV has changed somewhat since his teenage days, the 38-year-old said he valued the lessons he learned from balancing college work and part-time employment with trying to fulfill his dream of becoming an F1 driver.“I tried a bunch of different things, but when I was at work, all I was thinking of was how I’m going to win the next race,” Hamilton said, looking relaxed ahead of this weekend’s Miami Grand Prix.“I think people do see successful people on social media and it’s hard to understand how much grafting it takes to get to a good place.“The crazy thing is I’m in my 17th year of this sport […] I’m still grafting. I’m still having to chip away. I’m still having to work like never before to be able to excel in a sport that’s constantly evolving.“The competition is constantly rising. It’s getting tougher and tougher by the year. You just have to have the winning mindset and belief in yourself that you will get there no matter how many times you fall.”Winning races has come naturally to Hamilton throughout his career. In fact, no one in the history of the sport has won more.But success has been harder to come by of late, with his Mercedes car struggling to compete with the speed of Red Bull.Despite becoming an underdog in the past two seasons – Hamilton has not won a race since 2021 – he believes he could one day secure a record eighth world championship title.“That’s what I’m working towards,” he said.Hamilton spoke to CNN Sport at an International Watch Company (IWC) event in Miami, where he participated in basketball challenges alongside other famous faces.While Hamilton, a IWC ambassador, was not particularly impressed with his own skills on the court, he was happy to be competing in an event organized in collaboration with non-profit charity, Dibia DREAM.The US-based charity aims to bring about social change through STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and recreational education for underserved communities, a cause which matches Hamilton’s own ambitions.In addition to being a voice on issues such as climate change, Hamilton has put pressure on his sport, and wider society, to become more equal and inclusive.It’s a mission perhaps born out of his own experiences – Hamilton previously told CNN that the education system in the UK “failed” him after he was kicked out of school for something he said he didn’t do.Black Caribbean students were around 1.7 times more likely to be permanently expelled from UK schools compared with White British students, according to the Hamilton Commission – a report led by the driver which looked to address the underrepresentation of Black people in UK motorsport and the STEM sector.He has since channeled his own setbacks into a cause for good, setting up Mission 44 – a foundation that looks to support, promote and empower underrepresented young people in the UK.“It’s just showing career choices, showing what STEM can lead to and encouraging young kids,” he said.“Education is so key, so important. The foundation, STEM, is so important to growth and opportunity.”Hamilton has recently become a part owner of the NFL’s Denver Broncos. He said he spends much of his time off in Colorado and was persuaded to invest in the team after conversations he had around making positive change.“It’s been quite an overwhelming experience. The opportunity came up and I leaped at it,” he said.“There’s not a lot of Black equity and Black leadership within sports in general, so that’s something I’m really passionate about being a part of changing. The further you go up the pyramid, the less diverse it is.”He added: “When we were talking, [the Broncos] were talking about how we can really have an impact and create more diversity within the organization. That for me was the selling point.“There’s a lot of work to do within the community. They already have a huge, diverse fan base, but I think internally we can also improve that.”The Miami leg of the F1 season was introduced to the calendar for the first time last year and promises to yet again attract famous faces from across the worlds of music, fashion and sport.It’s a space that Hamilton feels more than comfortable in.“I never really fully understood why the sport wasn’t as loved here and just to finally see the growth, the amount of love the American fans have been giving our sport,” he said.“There’s so much warmth and excitement. I’m really grateful for it.“In Miami, just the energy here is incredible, so it’s one of the most fun weekends we get to have.”",sport,0.0

So when they do arrive, the celebrations can be emphatic: Tony Finau does things a little differently.Hours after clinching the Mexico Open title with a three-shot win over world No. 1 Jon Rahm on Sunday, the American was back out on the greens. But Finau wasn’t retracing the steps of his victory at Vidanta Vallarta – he was at the nearby Lakes Course, caddying for two of his sons during some night-time par three action.Under the lights, the champion lugged a pair of bags as the two youngsters scampered ahead, as seen in footage shared to Twitter by the PGA Tour.The pictures will have come as no surprise to anyone who watched Netflix’s “Full Swing,” wherein Finau charmed viewers in his starring role as a devoted family man traveling the world with his wife Alayna and five children.The docuseries saw the 33-year-old revisit his childhood home in Salt Lake City and humble beginnings before he made it as a pro golfer. On Sunday, his sixth PGA Tour victory fell on El Día Del Niño – Children’s Day in Mexico – and Finau had a message for youngsters.“Keep working hard and keep believing in yourself, there’s nothing that you aren’t able to achieve with hard work and some faith in what you’re doing,” Finau told reporters.“That’s coming from someone I would say that’s very similar to the upbringing of a lot of kids in Mexico. You don’t have to have the resources, but if you have a desire and you work really hard, you never know what you can accomplish and what you can become. Hopefully, I’ve inspired some of these kids as they’ve been out here watching me and inspire them to do some great things.“I’m not really anybody special. When I was a kid, I was just like them, I didn’t come from very much, but I put a lot of sacrifice and hard work into becoming a great golfer. If you do that, then you can do some great things.”“Full Swing” posed the question of whether Finau could balance his family commitments with his pursuit of silverware. The American has answered that query emphatically.Having finished joint runner-up to Rahm at last year’s Mexico Open, Finau derailed the Spaniard’s title defense to clinch his fourth win in his last 18 starts and jump five places to world No. 11.While a major title remains elusive, triumph over the newly-crowned Masters champion and the game’s most in-form player is a morale boost ahead of the PGA Championship later this month.“Any time you can battle with a guy like Jon Rahm who’s in the form that he was and come out on top, it makes me feel good,” Finau said.“Rahm is a good friend of mine, we practice quite a bit together so having ‘Rahmbo’ as like a sparring partner for me has only made me better and I hope he can say the same.“As far as my future, you never know what your future holds, but take it a day at a time and this is a nice step in the right direction on my season. We’ll just continue to stack up hopefully some wins and some major championships in the future.”",sport,0.0

The American also won at Augusta en route to banking $14,046,910 across 25 events last year.Rahm has blown past Scheffler’s sum in just 12 outings, boosted by imperious form and increased prize money at the PGA Tour’s select “designated events.” Three of the world No. 1’s four wins have come at designated events: his victories at the Sentry Tournament of Champions, The Genesis Invitational and The Masters totaling $9 million in winner’s earnings.And there is ample time for Rahm to stretch the record even further.There are nine designated events – including three majors – left to play before the season wraps up with the Tour Championship in Atlanta in late August.However, Rahm and Scheffler will miss their first elevated event of the season on Thursday, with both absent from the field for the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow in North Carolina.Golfers are permitted to skip one designated event per season but will see money deducted from their Player Impact Performance (PIP) earnings for subsequent absences. Rory McIlroy is set to lose $3 million (25%) of his PIP pay after withdrawing from the RBC Heritage last month, having already missed the Sentry Tournament of Champions in January, according to Reuters.With $49,486,883 in total earnings since joining the PGA Tour in 2016, Rahm looks set to pass the $50 million mark imminently upon his return.Rahm finished three shots adrift of a $1.386 million payout and a fifth victory of the season as Finau took his revenge at the Mexico Open.The American had finished joint-second, one shot shy, of Rahm at last year’s event, but improved his total by eight shots to end on 24-under and clinch his sixth PGA Tour title.Finau began the final round with a two-shot advantage over Rahm and shot five birdies to card a five-under 66.A bogey at the penultimate hole derailed any hope of the Spaniard retaining his title, a prospect that had been on the cards after he shot a course record 10-under 61 on Saturday, equaling his lowest ever PGA Tour round.Given his form, Rahm looks well-placed to add to his two majors and 11 PGA Tour titles this year, but the 28-year-old is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. Narrowly missing out on victory reminded Rahm of a quote from golfing great Arnold Palmer: “The path to success is always under construction.”“It’s a great reminder that what you’ve done means absolutely nothing, you still have to go out there and do it,” Rahm told reporters.“Obviously, I wanted to win, but it’s a reminder that everybody out here is a great player and Tony came out with a two-shot lead and played fantastic golf. I feel like, had I been able to pressure him a little more, we would have seen more birdies from Tony.“It’s like I said, a great reminder of what I still need to do to be able to keep winning tournaments, and if you ask me, that’s almost a blessing in life, to know that the work is not really done.“It’s never done, the search is ever ongoing.”",sport,0.0

On the first replay of the 18th hole, the 25-year-old curled home a winding birdie putt to clinch victory after Yin’s second shot had splashed into the water.Shortly after, it was Vu’s turn to find the water. Leaping into Poppie’s Pond had been a long-running tradition for champions at Mission Hills in California, host of the major from its inception until its relocation to Carlton Woods for 2023.Vu wasted no time in renewing the ritual, diving into the lake beside the 18th green to toast her second LPGA Tour victory and a winner’s check of $765,000, the largest of her career. Having almost walked away from the sport following early struggles as a pro, it crowned a cathartic victory for the world No. 12.“Everything happens for a reason,” Vu told reporters.“All the bad things, everything I’ve ever struggled through, family-wise, internally, I think myself as the biggest obstacle, I had a pretty tough, not easy past two days.“I was definitely my own enemy, and I don’t know how I pulled this out. I’m just really happy and proud of Cole [caddie] and I for doing this.”Despite a decorated amateur career, Vu endured a grueling start to life on the LPGA Tour, making the cut just once in her first nine starts after turning professional in early 2019.She would not play another LPGA event until 2022, by which point she had lost a formative figure in her life. Vu’s grandfather, who had fled his native Vietnam with her mother, had died in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.Amid bubbling frustrations during a wet and windy final round, it was the memory of her grandfather that kept Vu grounded.“I was just in such a bad place with my golf game. Everything was life or death,” Vu said. “I just saw everybody that I’ve competed with being successful, and I just compared myself all the time.“But now I know that everybody’s journey is different, and everything happens for a reason … Even today, I was getting really upset on the course, and I just had to remind me, like, ‘Grandpa is with you, and he’d be really disappointed if you were getting upset like this and that you didn’t get your act together.’“I think he’d say that all my struggles were worth it,” she added.Runner-up Yin was upbeat despite agonizingly missing out on a first career major. The 24-year-old, runner-up at the US Open in 2019, had looked poised for victory before back-to-back birdies at the 16th and 17th holes opened the door for Vu.A pressure birdie at the final hole to force the playoff signaled a strong response, but Yin’s fightback was ultimately sunk by her subsequent shot into the water.“I didn’t really feel much nerves at all this week, even coming into this stretch,” Yin told reporters.“My caddie was telling me to calm down, but other than that, I really just wasn’t really feeling much. I’m just really mellow. That’s why this lack of emotion, and I’m not crying.“I’m just really happy with who I am, where I am and what I’m doing right now … If I can talk about how much I appreciate life right now, I’ll get emotional, not over this,” she added.World No. 2 Nelly Korda finished one stroke short of making the playoff in third, with Thailand’s Atthaya Thitikul headlining the group of five players that finished tied for fourth at eight-under par.Meanwhile, Jennifer Kupcho endured a grim attempt to defend her title, shooting six-over par to miss the cut and finish tied for 108th.The women’s golf major calendar continues with the US Open at Pebble Beach in California on June 6.",sport,0.0

The next major on the calendar, the PGA Championship at Oak Hill in New York, looms on May 18.The golf icon’s competitive appearances have been sporadic since suffering severe leg injuries in a serious car crash in 2021, with Woods prioritizing taking part at the majors.His 25th appearance at The Masters marked just his second competitive event of the year, and in 2022, his PGA Tour outings were limited to The Masters, The PGA Championship and The Open Championship.Woods’ withdrawal at Augusta sparked further questions about his future in game, with Woods himself unsure as to how many Masters appearances he had left in him.Sky Sports analyst Butch Harmon said he had hoped Woods wouldn’t make the cut at the tournament, given the “agony” he saw the golf legend enduring while navigating the hilly Augusta terrain.“If you look where The Open is this year [Royal Liverpool], it’s fairly flat … US Open in LA – yes, the LA Country Club’s got some hills and stuff,” Harmon added.“The difficulty here [Augusta National] is the walk, it’s just such a tough walk for everybody and so I think it had to happen for his sake. Will we see him again? Gosh, I hope so.”",sport,0.0

I totally get it, but I don’t know. I was called ‘a little rat’ but I don’t know why.”Video clips of the incident have been widely shared on social media.A spokesperson for Celtic told CNN that it was “a hugely concerning incident, falling well below any acceptable standard.”Celtic added: “We understand the matter is now being investigated and it will be up to all relevant authorities to take any appropriate action.”Rangers manager Malky Thomson said he hadn’t witnessed the incident and told Sky Sports he wouldn’t comment, adding, “If that is the case, there will be an investigation into it and we will obviously look at it.”CNN reached out to Rangers for comment but did not receive a response.The SWPL told CNN it was aware of the incident but said it would “not make any further comment” while the investigation is ongoing.",sport,0.0

The 20-year-old explained that as a result, she will miss this summer’s tennis events, including the French Open and Wimbledon.“It pains me that I will miss the summer events and I tried to downplay the issues, so I thank all my fans who continued to support me when you didn’t know the facts,” Raducanu wrote in a hand-written letter posted on Instagram.Raducanu, who won the 2021 US Open, has suffered a myriad of injuries over the past 18 months which have blighted her hopes of on-court success.She suffered an ankle injury before the Australian Open earlier this year, while tonsillitis forced her to withdraw from the Austin Open in February.Meanwhile, a recurring wrist injury, which hampered Raducanu last season, came back during the Miami Open, where she exited in the first round.Last month, Raducanu lost in the first round of the Stuttgart Open in less than an hour.Her performances have seen her slip down the world rankings, where she currently sits at No. 85, and the injury break means she is set to fall out of the top 100.“It is safe to say the last 10 months have been difficult as I dealt with a recurring injury on a bone of both hands,” Raducanu said.“I tried my best to manage the pain and play through it most of this year and end of last year by reducing practice load dramatically, missing weeks of training as well as cutting last season short to try heal it, unfortunately it’s not enough.”The French Open begins on May 22 in Paris while Wimbledon begins on July 3 in London.",sport,0.0

It’s a very sad situation and I understand. I was actually happy that she waved me back. I’m already happy with that.”After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, numerous sports governing bodies around the world issued blanket bans on Russian and Belarusian athletes competing.Tennis – Wimbledon last year aside – didn’t follow suit, instead allowing players from Russia and Belarus compete as neutral athletes and Kasatkina said she feels fortunate to still be able to play tennis.“I was really sad to miss Wimbledon last year – of course for a reason, but it still was painful,” she said.“I’m happy that we will be able to come back this year and to be honest we are the luckiest sport as we are able to compete still.“Ninety-five percent of the athletes from Russia could not go outside and compete in the international events, and we really appreciate this opportunity and that we can be on the international stage.”",sport,0.0

Emotionally, it’s heavy. The stress is huge because I never thought I would face something like this,” Halep said in an interview with Tennis Majors released on Thursday.“I have always been against doping as I am a big supporter of clean sports. At the beginning, I didn’t know how to handle it. Over time, I just tried to stay calm and actually, I feel confident because I know I’m clean and I didn’t take anything knowingly that is banned.”Halep’s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, is one of the co-founders and shareholders of Tennis Majors.The 31-year-old added that she has sent evidence of taking what she believes to be a contaminated supplement to the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and has requested a hearing about her case, but said the ITF rejected her evidence.She also said she has taken 10 negative urine tests since being notified of her positive result.According to the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), a player disputing a doping charge can request a hearing before a three-person independent tribunal.In a statement on Twitter on Friday, the ITF said it “has had no involvement in the management of this case, as the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme is managed and enforced by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) on behalf of the ATP, WTA, ITF and Grand Slams.”An ITIA spokesperson told CNN that the process “is ongoing and is being run in line with the World Anti-Doping Code.”“I had a big hope that I could go to the tribunal to have a hearing and then I would know if I could play Indian Wells [in March] or not,” said Halep.“(A) hearing on February 28 didn’t happen because the ITF requested more time to do additional testing … Everything takes so long. I asked the ITF to lift my sanction to be able to play but they also refused it.”Halep, who has not played since a first-round defeat at last year’s US Open, said that her tribunal hearing is now scheduled to take place on May 28, adding that it is “not fair” to have waited almost eight months between her provisional suspension and the hearing.“Emotionally, the whole period has not been easy and I just felt the need to speak out loud to my fans, to my supporters, and actually to the whole public,” she said.“I’m sure they really want to know what’s going on and why it’s taking so long. I wanted to remain silent until the case was solved but it’s too heavy, so I felt that it would be really good for me to speak about it out loud.”",sport,0.0

Jason Jackson will serve as the Alabama’s interim head coach, the school said.Per ESPN, the state casino commission’s investigation is centered around multiple bets on the Tigers to win from the same customer, who has been unidentified, multiple industry sources told ESPN Thursday.The casino commission then halted wagering on all college baseball games involving Alabama, according to an emergency order obtained by CNN. The commission added it will “continue to look into the matter.”CNN has attempted to reach out to Bohannon but has not heard back.The casino commission was first alerted about the alleged activity last Friday by independent Las Vegas-based integrity firm US Integrity, according to ESPN. US Integrity works with the Ohio Casino Commission and the Southeastern Conference to monitor the betting markets.CNN has reached out to US Integrity for comment.A spokesperson for the NCAA told CNN on Thursday that the NCAA takes “sports wagering very seriously and is committed to the protection of student-athlete well-being and the integrity of competition.”The association is “monitoring the situation” but declined to comment further on “current, pending or potential investigations” due to confidentiality rules, the spokesperson added.On Wednesday night, SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said the conference is investigating the situation.“We are aware of reports related to the suspension of wagering Alabama baseball games,” Sankey said. “We will continue to monitor available information and any regulatory activity.“As many states have acted to legalize sports gambling, we are reminded of the threats gambling may pose on competitive integrity. Together with our member universities, we will continue to emphasize the importance of regulating, overseeing and providing education related to sports gambling activity.”In an updated statement Thursday, Sankey said Alabama took “swift action after information about baseball sports wagering activity was questioned by industry regulators.”On Thursday, Pennsylvania became the third state to order sportsbooks to halt betting on Alabama baseball, joining Ohio and New Jersey as investigations are still ongoing, per ESPN.A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board told ESPN the ban on betting on Alabama baseball was put in place “as a matter of precaution” and will last until “further notice.”CNN has reached out to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.A spokesperson from the New Jersey Attorney General’s office told CNN that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement instructed sportsbooks to “suspend wagering on all contests involving the University of Alabama baseball team and associated players, including future wagers” on Wednesday out of an “abundance of caution.”Currently, the New Jersey gaming operators and their independent fraud monitors have not “detected any suspicious wagering” in the state, the spokesperson added.Ronnie Johns, executive director of the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, said he didn’t suspect any wrongdoing on the LSU side of things.“The problem,” Johns said to NOLA.com, “would have been whether someone on the Alabama side was suspicious of activity.”CNN has reached out to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board.Bohannon was hired as the Crimson Tide’s head coach in June 2017 and compiled a 166-124 record with one NCAA tournament appearance coming in 2021.Alabama is 30-15 this season and scheduled to begin a series against No. 5 Vanderbilt on Thursday night in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.",sport,0.0

Critics have suggested the 10-time All-Star doesn’t produce when it really matters, but in this vital game, Harden delivered with a vintage performance.On the night of the Met Gala, the guard made a stunning fashion statement off the court – and just had to show up on the hardwood to match his effort off it. Harden did just this and dropped 45 points on 17-of-30 shooting, as well draining seven shots from deep at a rate of 50% in a performance reminiscent of his MVP days with the Houston Rockets.Buoyed by the home crowd support at TD Garden, the Celtics raced off to a strong start. Jaylen Brown scored 14 first-quarter points and Boston took a 38-31 lead after the opening quarter.Sixers fans could have been forgiven for thinking the worst at this point of the game without the NBA’s back-to-back scoring champion, but this Philadelphia team is made of sterner stuff than past iterations.Quarter by quarter, Doc Rivers’ team scraped back the Celtics’ lead and the scores were level at 87-87 heading into the final 12 minutes.Both teams traded buckets in the decisive quarter with neither side allowing their counterpart to gain any significant advantage, but thanks to a pair of Jayson Tatum free throws, the Celtics took a one-point advantage with 26 seconds left on the clock.The Sixers then worked the ball to “The Beard,” and Harden sought out a mismatch on the Celtics’ Al Horford.The 33-year-old’s teammates fled the scene and allowed Harden to isolate Horford for a 1-on-1 at the top of the key. The iso king patiently worked on the Celtics center before draining a trademark step-back three to give the Sixers the lead in the clutch – ultimately winning the game for his side in the process.Speaking to reporters post-game, Harden touched on his attitude heading into the match-up.“We didn’t come into the game expecting to lose. We came in here to win,” Harden explained. “Whether [Embiid] comes back or not, we’re going to be ready to go.”It wasn’t just Harden who delivered for the Sixers in Embiid’s absence with Tyrese Maxey, Tobias Harris and De’Anthony Melton also stepping up when needed with 26, 18 and 17 points respectively.Speaking after the game, Sixers head coach Rivers spoke on the group effort from his squad.“That’s the difference between this year’s team and last year’s team. We have a bunch of street fighters,” Rivers said. “If we could get to the fourth quarter, we were going to win the game. That’s how we felt.”Elsewhere, the Denver Nuggets took a 2-0 series lead against the Phoenix Suns to take control of their Western Conference semifinal.In a relatively low-scoring affair, reigning back-to-back MVP Nikola Jokic tallied 39 points, 16 rebounds and five assists as the Nuggets sealed a 97-87 win.The Suns will be concerned with the health of point guard Chris Paul, who had to leave the game early, as they look to mount a comeback on their home court.",sport,0.0

Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.Kamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.It will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.Kamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.Describing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”Using a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”Kamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.Qatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.He says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.A Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”The official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.With the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.The Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.Hassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.A government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”It has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.Eight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.Since 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.However, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”Last year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.We are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.Hari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).After moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”During his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.He added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”Working long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.In 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.The government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”Natasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”Determining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”According to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.In its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.The statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”Amnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”Barun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”Last year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”Iskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”Knight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”For the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.His friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.Now, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.Sunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.He had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”In helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”He says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.For a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”The SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.Since 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.Qatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.The spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.Such attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.In Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”Knight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”Ghimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.Qatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”Human Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.Families of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”Ghimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”Earlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.A Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.In terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.Last month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”It has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.FIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.The motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.As NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”Hosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.",sport,0.0
328,352,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/11/sport/zhou-jihong-diving-fina-spt-intl/index.html,"She apologized for verbally abusing an Olympic judge, but questions over the conduct of China’s ‘Iron Lady’ of diving remain",2022-05-12 03:45:00,"For Lisa Wright, an elite-level diving judge from New Zealand, it was supposed to be the highlight of her career – the chance to adjudicate at the sport’s premier event at the Olympics.But the scenes that unfolded after the men’s 10-meter platform final in Tokyo last year “darkened” her Olympic experience for some time, Wright says.They also led to an official complaint being lodged by Diving New Zealand and Wright against Zhou Jihong – a vice-president of water sports governing body FINA and one of the most influential figures in diving – on the grounds of harassment and abuse.That was after Zhou, who has been dubbed the “Iron Lady” of Chinese diving, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the 10m platform event’s conclusion for underscoring Chinese divers.“She was on poolside screaming at me and yelling at me – it was definitely one of the most humiliating experiences of my life,” Wright tells CNN Sport.Zhou was later ordered by a FINA Ethics Panel to write a letter of apology to Wright.However, some members of the diving community view Zhou’s actions at the Olympics as a flashpoint amid a wider pattern of conduct they believe is harmful to the sport.One of those who holds that belief is New Zealander Simon Latimer, a former diver and judge and now a member of FINA’s Diving Technical Committee (TDC).Following the incident at the Olympics, Latimer sent a whistleblower complaint to FINA’s executive director Brent Nowicki in December detailing Zhou’s alleged “unethical behavior” which he says stretches back several years and “compromises the integrity of both diving and FINA.”This contains allegations that Zhou has routinely coached Chinese divers during major events – including the Tokyo Olympics – and has manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes.Zhou has not spoken publicly about these allegations. CNN has contacted the General Administration of Sport of China and the Chinese Swimming Association for a response from Zhou but has not received a response.Latimer’s complaint also focused on the events after the men’s 10m platform final last year, an incident he says he witnessed and describes as a “personal outburst” from Zhou towards Wright.“Part of making this complaint is to ensure that an incident like that … never happens again,” Latimer tells CNN Sport. “There’s a lot of things to consider around athlete welfare, but we also need to consider the welfare of officials.”The final concluded with Chinese divers Cao Yuan and Yang Jian winning gold and silver medals respectively and Great Britain’s Tom Daley securing bronze.Wright then approached Zhou to offer her congratulations on China’s success, but says she was met with a barrage of verbal abuse and the allegation that she hadn’t judged to an appropriate standard and had underscored Chinese athletes.“I just said I’m sorry you feel that way and I left and ended up crying in the bathroom, which was definitely not how you want to end your premier event of the Olympics,” says Wright.“It was pretty traumatic for me, to be honest, especially given the fact that everyone knows that she’s the vice president of FINA.”Of some consolation for Wright was the support she received from other diving officials, who she says agreed with how she had scored athletes in the competition.Moreover, the event’s independent assessor – responsible for monitoring the scores given by the judging panel – had agreed with her scoring on two occasions in which she gave a Chinese diver lower scores compared to her peers.In a diving event, judges on the panel award each dive a score ranging from zero to 10. Every FINA event has an assessor who watches replays of the dives, checks for bias in the judging, and evaluates the scores the judges are awarding.Wright says she had no interest in making a “personal complaint” or “retaliation” against Zhou, but was also aware of what might happen if no investigation was launched by diving’s authorities.She believes Zhou would have the power and influence to exclude her from judging panels.“In the end, I think my biggest question was: what am I in this sport for and what am I here for?” Wright says.“I felt that it was important that we do the best thing for the sport of diving, that it remains fair, because that’s what I’m here for as a judge: that I rank those divers in the order that they should be ranked.”In November, the FINA Ethics Panel ordered Zhou to formally apologize to Wright and Diving New Zealand for the incident.Wright says she received the letter of apology, “appreciated” it, but “didn’t feel like it was something personal” given Zhou had been instructed to send it.The panel also ruled that only members of the TDC should be allowed on pool deck during competitions and that Zhou’s Bureau Liaison position – traditionally tasked with taking the views of the TDC back to the FINA bureau – creates “confusion, conflict and discord” and “should be removed.”In his whistleblower complaint, which has been shared with CNN Sport, Latimer alleges that Zhou has provided coaching to Chinese athletes at international diving events – including the FINA World Championships and the Diving World Series, as well as the Olympics – despite her roles requiring neutrality.“It’s absolutely unethical … if you are up coaching divers from your own nation, I don’t see how you could be viewed as a neutral party,” says Latimer.“I also can’t think of any other sport where you would have a vice president on pool deck coaching and having such an open interest in the proceedings.”Since the Olympics, video footage has emerged reportedly showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers at the Games, while another TDC member, Colleen Huffman, says she has witnessed Zhou coaching at other international events.“A lot of times she’s very subtle about it, but obviously at the Olympics she wasn’t subtle at all,” Huffman tells CNN Sport.“For her to have her position and be a coach is a huge conflict of interest. It’s one thing if she helps out at home with the national team, but it’s another thing if she’s actively coaching an athlete at a major FINA event when she’s the Bureau Liaison.”In a statement sent to CNN Sport, TDC member Dominique Philippopoulos said she has twice requested to coach divers from her native South Africa at international events, but on both occasions had her requests denied by FINA officials on the grounds it was a conflict of interest.That’s despite coming from a country where the sport of diving is small and the obstacles are many.According to Philippopoulos, the South African diving federation has limited resources and struggles to finance overseas trips and to cover the cost of coaches.A third allegation made by Latimer in his whistleblower complaint is that Zhou has deliberately manipulated judging panels in an apparent attempt to benefit Chinese divers.“Two judges have confidentially advised me that they believe they are regularly disregarded to judge finals as punishment for not judging Chinese divers as favourably as Zhou Jihong would like,” he wrote.“One judge informed me that Zhou Jihong approached them at a World Cup Event in 2018 and asked ‘why do you not like China?’”According to Latimer, Zhou has “substantial input” when it comes to deciding which judges are chosen to officiate at competitions.He cites his own experience as a judge at the 2016 Rio Olympics, ahead of which he says he had been awarded the highest cumulative evaluation score from assessors among international judges through 2015-2016.But he alleges in his whistleblower complaint that he “fell out of favor” as a judge during the Olympics and was only reinstated for the men’s platform final when members of the TDC Commission “convinced Zhou Jihong” to reappoint him.“What concerns me and some others is that judges appointed to finals aren’t always the ones that appear to be assessed most highly,” says Latimer.“There’s certainly a discrepancy in some judges with very high evaluations getting very few appointments.”Since making his whistleblower complaint, Latimer says he has received a response from FINA saying the governing body won’t look into the issues he raised as they were already considered during the previous complaint submitted by Wright and Diving New Zealand.However, allegations about Zhou manipulating judging panels and coaching during events were not directly mentioned in the Ethics Panel’s response to that initial complaint.These issues, Latimer says, are being “swept under the carpet” by FINA.In a statement sent to CNN, FINA said: “The reports regarding Ms Jihong Zhou were fully investigated by an independent panel that heard from witnesses and reached a decision which is publicly available on the FINA website.“The independent panel concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that competition results were impacted in any way and to our knowledge, no further formal allegations have been made beyond what has been previously decided by the independent panel.“At all times, FINA’s primary concern is the welfare of the aquatics community and ensuring the integrity of our competitions.”Latimer calls the incident between Zhou and Wright at the Olympics a “watershed moment” for him – the moment he decided to support the New Zealand federation’s complaint and then subsequently speak publicly about Zhou’s behavior and his concerns for the integrity of the sport.“I’m well aware that through this whistleblower process, I could lose my position on the Technical Committee,” he says.“We have elections in two months’ time in Budapest [at the World Championships, which start on June 17]. But for me, seeing this complaint through and getting some action is more important than maintaining my position on the committee, although I would obviously like to stay on the committee and be part of the process to ensure this sort of behavior doesn’t continue.”Allegations against Zhou, Latimer says, have been slow to emerge due to her influential status within the sport.The “Iron Lady” of Chinese diving, Zhou became the country’s first ever Olympic gold medalist in the sport in 1984.She went on to spearhead China’s dominance in diving, coaching the national team from 1990 to 1997. Today, as well as being a FINA vice president, she is also the chair of the Chinese Swimming Association.“People are scared stiff, they’re petrified of rocking the boat and losing their position,” Latimer says.Huffman, meanwhile, says she fears for the future of the sport and the potential difficulty of attracting new judges given Zhou’s alleged behavior.“People won’t want to judge. They just won’t,” she adds.“We’re already struggling to get judges, particularly out of the South America region. All the judges from that area are aging out and the new people coming in, they hear bad things about her, how mean she is, how intimidating she is. Who wants to go experience that?”As for Wright, she’s looking forward to her next judging commitments with optimism, undaunted by what happened at the Olympics. She is in line to officiate at the World Championships in June and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, in July.Zhou will likely be at the World Championships, but that doesn’t cause her too much concern.“What’s in the past is in the past,” says Wright. “I really do believe that I choose forgiveness, that I choose to just move on and continue doing what I love.”",sport,0.0
329,353,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html,Meet the Black women pushing for equality in swimming,"09:41 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.“There’s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you’ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,” the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation – a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is “the only sport that can save your life.”The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.“I used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,” she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.“There’s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,” Dale adds.She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London.It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people – and leaving many more without homes.“There’s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons … who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,” Dale says.“Many people say it’s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they’ve taken time for themselves.”While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England’s report, published in January 2020.Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found.This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have “low” or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country’s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a “Whites Only” rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England – England’s national swimming governing body – and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.“Most drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,” says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family – a 53-year-old father and his two children – died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.“This was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,” Obe says. “(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, ‘We’ve been talking about doing something for our community. We’ve got to do something. We’ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.’”“It’s no longer just about that lack of representation,” Obe adds.“It’s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.”However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.“At the moment, we don’t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn’t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.”Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, “implores” people to learn to swim.“I have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who’s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,” she tells CNN Sport.“I take the two of them just as they are – kind of like separate things. I’m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.”At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people – especially Black girls – who wanted to break into the sport.But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.“Fortunately, for myself, I haven’t come across any barriers at the level I’m at currently,” Dearing says.“But I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don’t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we’re better suited to other sports and so shouldn’t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.”CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.FINA – the global governing body for swimming – told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its “Swimming for All, Swimming for Life” program.“FINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,” the organization said to CNN in a statement. “FINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally.“Work will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,” FINA added.Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is “committed to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.”“Barriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups – like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,” the statement added.Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than £550 million ($670 million), which they’ve selected “due to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.”“It’s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,” Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.“Our goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they’re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,” he added.Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.From representing their organization at the UK’s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney – one of the most deprived boroughs in London – Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.“That community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,” says Obe.“Only in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.”In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.Speaking about the program, Obe says: “It’s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we’re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don’t engage in aquatics, why we don’t see the representation pool side and why we don’t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.”Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she’s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.“I really think if anything is going to change, it’s going to be now, it’s going to be over the next couple of years,” she says. “Each story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there’s nothing wrong with that, that’s just another challenge that we have to face and we’re up for it.“It’s tough – it’s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.“I like to feel that I’m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.“It’s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it’s really frightening and daunting, but if I’m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.”",sport,0.0
330,354,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/21/sport/british-gymnastics-abuse-intl-spt-cmd/index.html,‘I had PTSD’: Culture of abuse in British gymnastics leaves lasting legacy on its victims,"09:41 AM, Mon May 08, 2023","For Claire Heafford, the abuse she says she suffered as a young gymnast has left a lasting mark on her life.Heafford, who’s now in her 40s, told CNN Sport she experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after competing in British gymnastics in the 1990s, when she alleges, she was physically and emotionally abused.Now, she says she finally feels “vindicated,” after years fighting for reform in the sport through the organization she co-founded, Gymnasts for Change.Last week, an independent review concluded that British Gymnastics allowed for a culture of physical and emotional abuse and failed to provide a safe environment for gymnasts, with children body-shamed, belittled and abused.Heafford said she felt “a massive feeling of vindication” following the release of a review conducted by barrister Anne Whyte, saying it “completely validated everything that we’d anecdotally known and had been reporting and campaigning on for two years.”Released Thursday, Whyte’s 300-plus page review concluded that British Gymnastics should have been aware of the “bullying, harassment and excessive control” that occurred in training clubs between 2008 and 2020.“My own experience was that I was trained by the first Russian that was brought over to the UK in the 90s,” Heafford told CNN’s Amanda Davies.“I grew up in a Soviet training camp in the heart of the home counties [the counties surrounding London]. It was too bizarre to be believed. So as a kid just at an ordinary state school, trying to explain to my school friends, what my training life was like was difficult,” she said.In the report, Whyte highlighted the “recruitment of a significant number of coaches” from the former Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc.“The technical skill and experience of these coaches, whilst formidable, was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities,” Whyte wrote, adding that the ability of these coaches to produce decorated gymnasts was admired and later emulated by coaches in the UK.Heafford says what she experienced in the 1990s mirrors incidents reported to Whyte, who was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England to review allegations that British Gymnastics failed to address complaints for decades.Whyte received over 400 submissions and interviewed 190 people after her call for evidence in August 2020.In response to the review, British Gymnastics chief executive Sarah Powell admitted Thursday that the organization failed the sport of gymnastics and apologized on behalf of the sporting body.“I wish to accept all of the recommendations and the key findings, and we will work hard to ensure that these are acted upon quickly and robustly,” stated Powell.“But most importantly, I want to wholeheartedly apologize on behalf of the leadership and the board for those gymnasts who have suffered because we have not met the standards that are expected for our sport.”“When you do try to raise the alarm as a child and you’re shut down, it makes you think that if you do speak out, you’re not going to be believed,” Heafford, who left the sport in 1995, told CNN.“From that point on, I never watched gymnastics. I got the hell away from it. And I went into athletics, which is where I had wonderful experiences, and I loved every minute of being a track and field athlete. So it was only when I stopped competing that I started to get PTSD symptoms showing up from my time in gymnastics,” she added.After distancing herself from the sport for years, Heafford now coaches adults in gymnastics, runs body positive gymnastics classes and campaigns for change in the sport – particularly for the recognition of historic abuse.Other gymnasts have been vocal in their support of the report’s release. Two-time Olympian Becky Downie, who competed for Great Britain in the 2008 and 2016 Olympic Games, said the report “feels like a vindication for myself and so many who have known for so long of the serious cultural problems within the sport. A sport I love more than anything.”“Finally everyone knows the truth and while it won’t directly benefit those who have experienced it, it’s encouraging to know that if the recommendations are implemented, it’ll protect and enhance the next generation of gymnasts,” she wrote on Instagram and Twitter.Whyte recommended systemic changes in her review, including calling on British Gymnastics to improve its complaints system by offering better guidance on how concerns should be investigated and strengthening how complaints are monitored so that patterns of abuse can be better recognized.Whyte also recommended that British Gymnastics reassess the level of responsibility delegated to volunteers and employ trained, expert staff, as well as introducing mandatory safeguarding training for all club owners and managers.She added that British Gymnastics must appoint board members with expertise in promoting the welfare of children and protecting them from harm, as well as a director of education with responsibility for the education of coaches and welfare officers.Downie added: “While it’ll never make what has been allowed to happen to myself and so many others ok, it has been made clear us athletes have been heard, and I’m overwhelmingly encouraged for the future of young gymnasts in this country.”UK Sport and Sport England said they accepted and endorsed the review’s recommendations, and that they would continue to support British Gymnastics.“At this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now,” the joint UK Sport and Sport England statement reads.“However, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report’s recommendations.”This week, 18-year-old former elite acrobatic gymnast Eloise Jotischky won the first civil case against British Gymnastics for the abuse she said she experienced at the hands of a coach.She and Heafford are among a group of 39 plaintiffs involved in civil cases focusing on historic abuse by coaches who fell under the auspices of British Gymnastics, according to a representative for Gymnastics for Change.British Gymnastics admitted full liability in Jotischky’s case and reached a settlement with the former gymnast, whom the BBC reported also received an apology from the chief executive of the organization.Jotischky, who said her coach subjected her to inappropriate weight management techniques and verbal harassment, told CNN Sport in an email she was glad the report had “finally exposed the catastrophic safeguarding failures that led to the abuse of hundreds of gymnasts.”In the report, Whyte highlighted submissions detailing how “some coaches went to damaging lengths to control what gymnasts ate and weighed, to the extent of searching luggage and rooms for food. As a result, some gymnasts suffered from (and still suffer from) eating disorders and associated mental health issues.”Jotischky, who competed in the sport between the ages of eight and 14, told CNN Sport she was encouraged that British Gymnastics intended to implement the report’s recommendations.But she expressed concern, saying that “more needs to be done to address and reform the endemic culture of abuse that has been so deeply ingrained within the sport.”In particular, Jotischky said she believes a register of coaches is critical: “Without a register of coaches, parents will never know when their child is being coached by someone who has had allegations of abuse against them. The failures of the past have proved that parents should not be shut out, especially in a sport where the coaches are being entrusted with the welfare of young children.”When approached for a comment on Jotischky’s remarks, British Gymnastics declined to comment further.Jotischky said that, since becoming the first gymnast to win her legal case against British Gymnastics, she has been overwhelmed by the number of gymnasts who have contacted her to share their experiences.“It shows there are so many gymnasts who are afraid to speak out publicly and that must change,” she said.Heafford agreed.“The reality is that national governing bodies operate within a vacuum from a legal point of view. And the only thing that will bring actual cultural change to sport generally and specifically to the sport of gymnastics is legislative change,” she said, adding that she is calling for mandatory reporting whereby parents, gymnasts and coaches within training facilities would legally be required to report any abuse they observed.Heafford said that it was difficult for survivors to speak up, adding “there is such defensiveness within the culture of gymnastics.”“You know that as a gymnast, if you speak out about culture, there will be repercussions. You’ll be ostracized from the community, so it’s not an easy thing to do,” she said.UK Sport and Sport England referred CNN to last week’s joint statement when approached for further comment.The report comes as gymnastics institutions worldwide have been forced to reckon with claims of abuse and safeguarding failures following an outpouring of survivor testimony.In March, more than 70 former and current gymnasts in Canada called for an investigation into “ongoing toxic and abusive practices” gymnasts are allegedly subject to in the country.In an open letter addressed to Sport Canada, the athletes have called for the governing body to conduct an “independent, third-party investigation.”At the time, GymCan said it was aware of the letter being circulated and agreed that an external and independent organization must be established to oversee complaints.In May, GymCan and its Provincial Member Organizations said they had been informed by the media of a proposed class action lawsuit, filed with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in which they are named as defendants.“Although we have not been served, the allegations we have been made aware of in the claim describe behaviour that is unacceptable in any sport environment, and we take them very seriously,” GymCan said in a statement, adding they are committed to addressing all allegations with “diligence and due process.”This comes four years after disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.At the sentencing, 156 victims, including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, recounted stories of how they went to Nassar to receive treatment for sports injuries, only to be sexually assaulted and told it was a form of treatment.Attorneys for more than 90 women and girls who were sexually abused by Nassar this month submitted claims for over $1 billion to the FBI, saying investigators could have ended Nassar’s predation and protected other victims had they not mishandled the case.The claimants include Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles, Raisman and Maroney and world championship medalist Maggie Nichols. Each has asked for $50 million, according to the law firm that represents them.CNN this month contacted the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI, and officials there declined to comment.",sport,0.0

Cargo vessels routinely dock at Cape Town’s civilian harbor, not the naval base.At the time, opposition member of parliament and shadow Defense Minister Kobus Marais said in a statement that goods were offloaded from the ship and onloaded onto the ship during the overnight hours and demanded answers from the government.The US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control added the Lady R to its sanctions list in May last year for alleged weapons shipments, along with a host of other Russian-flagged cargo vessels.The South African presidency called the explosive allegations “disappointing” and warned that the remarks “undermine the spirit of cooperation and partnership” between the US and South African government officials who had been discussing the matter.President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement late Thursday that no evidence had been provided to support these allegations and that the government planned to form an independent inquiry into the matter.“In recent engagements between the South African delegation and US officials, the Lady R matter was discussed and there was agreement that an investigation will be allowed to run its course and that the US intelligence services will provide whatever evidence in their possession,” the statement read.CNN asked presidential spokesman Vincent Magwenya why an inquiry was needed for events at South Africa’s own naval base.“US intelligence services said they had evidence that they would only provide to us via a credible investigation or inquiry. We take the allegations seriously, and we want to have a credible independent voice to state the actual facts of the matter,” he said.“Otherwise, we risk a back forth series of accusations and denials, which is not going to be helpful in the context of our bilateral relations.”It is unusual for a US ambassador in South Africa to make such public accusations against the government.The South African government has come under intense criticism for its stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has routinely abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations General Assembly.While South African leadership has repeatedly stated that they are neutral in the conflict and have frequently called for a negotiated settlement, their actions have come under increasing scrutiny from Western powers.In February of this year, South Africa convened naval war games off its coast including both the Russian and Chinese military.Later this year, South Africa will host the BRICS summit, a grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to that summit.South African officials have flip-flopped in their public commitment to the Rome Statute – the treaty that compels signatory nations to arrest individuals indicted by the court – after Putin was indicted for alleged war crimes in March.While South Africa’s ruling party African National Congress has an ideological history with Russia and the former Soviet Union, the European Union and the United States are far bigger trading partners.",world,0.0
332,356,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/asia/cyclone-mocha-bangladesh-myanmar-intl-hnk/index.html,Cyclone Mocha is strengthening in the Bay of Bengal and heading toward the world’s largest refugee camp,2023-05-12 03:45:00,"A tropical cyclone is strengthening in the Bay of Bengal and is on course to hit western Myanmar and Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, where around 1 million people live in flimsy shelters in what many consider to be the world’s largest refugee camp.Cyclone Mocha is the first to form in the Bay this year and is expected to strengthen further before making landfall on Sunday, likely in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, near the border with Bangladesh.According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Mocha strengthened Friday into the equivalent of a category 1 Atlantic hurricane and is moving north at 11 kilometers per hour (7 miles per hour).The storm’s winds could peak at 220 kph (137 mph) – equivalent to a category 4 Atlantic hurricane – just before making landfall on Sunday morning, the agency said.India’s Meteorological Department said Friday Mocha had intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm and warned fishermen and trawlers against sailing far into the Bay over the coming days.The agency forecast a storm surge of up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) was likely to inundate low-lying coastal areas in the path of the cyclone at the time of landfall.In Bangladesh, that includes Cox’s Bazar, home to members of the stateless Rohingya community who fled persecution in nearby Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2017. Many live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides.There are also concerns for hundreds of Rohingya refugees housed on an isolated and flood-prone island facility in the Bay of Bengal, called Bhasan Char.Ahead of Mocha’s expected landfall, aid agencies are ramping up their emergency preparedness and response with local and refugee communities.The UN refugee agency in Bangladesh said in a tweet that “emergency preparations in the camps and on Bhasan Char are underway” in coordination with the government and local aid agencies.“In preparation of cyclones, hundreds of Rohingya refugee volunteers have been trained on identifying risks, informing their communities, evacuating people when needed and responding after disaster strikes,” the UNHCR said in a tweet.In neighboring Myanmar, residents in coastal areas of Rakhine state and Ayeyarwady region have started to evacuate their homes and seek shelter ahead of the cyclone’s expected landfall, according to local independent media Myanmar Now.The ruling Myanmar junta has issued cyclone warnings and claimed to be taking precautionary measures such as readying disaster management committees to respond to a potential disaster, according to state media Global New Light of Myanmar.The Joint Typhoon Warning Center said widespread flooding, landslides and high wind gusts are expected around the area of landfall and across Myanmar’s interior.The last named tropical cyclone to make landfall in Myanmar was Maarutha in April, 2017. Though Maarutha was the equivalent of a tropical storm at landfall, with maximum winds of 92 kph (58 mph), it brought heavy rains and damaged nearly 100 homes.In October 2010, Tropical Cyclone Giri was the last storm to make landfall with hurricane-force winds. It made landfall as a high-end Category 4 equivalent storm with maximum winds of 250 kph (155 mph).Giri caused over 150 fatalities and roughly 70% of the city of Kyaukphyu, in Rakhine state, was destroyed. According to the United Nations, roughly 15,000 homes were destroyed in the state during the storm.The worst natural disaster to hit Myanmar was Cyclone Nargis in May 2008, killing 140,000 people, severely affecting 2.4 million and leaving 800,000 displaced, aid agencies said.",world,0.0
333,357,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/europe/erdogan-earthquake-election-intl/index.html,An earthquake devastated Turkey. Can its strongman leader survive the aftershock?,2023-05-12 04:18:00,"Bedi Değirmenci has taken his first breaths of fresh air since a monster earthquake struck southeast Turkey three months ago.For three days, the 36-year-old lay trapped under the rubble of his home in Hatay. Then he was hospitalized for traumas to the head and spine, and discharged only on Wednesday, just days before the country’s historic May 14 presidential and parliamentary elections.Deep gashes frame the right side of Bedi’s face and he now walks with a permanent limp. When he reunites with the few relatives who survived the quake, the air fills with a crescendo of sobs — the grief of bereavement infused with relief over Bedi’s recovery.The earthquake killed Bedi’s wife, his parents-in-law, his two daughters and their cousin. The children were 4, 5 and 6 years old. Two other children from the wider family also lost their lives.For his tragedy, Bedi blames the government and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is battling for a third term, buffeted by economic headwinds and criticism that the impact of the February 6 earthquake was made worse by lax building controls and a shambolic rescue effort.The earthquake claimed more than 50,000 lives in Turkey and neighboring Syria, and displaced more than 6 million people. The state’s emergency workers were all but absent in many parts of the disaster area during the first few days that followed.For three days, Bedi’s relative – Caner Değirmenci – sledgehammered a path to the destroyed family home in Hatay. Just over 72 hours later, he and the Italian rescue team, Vigili del Fuoco, rescued Bedi and recovered the lifeless bodies of his wife and two daughters.“For the first 48 hours under the rubble, my daughter Talya was alive. We were talking together constantly,” says Bedi. “Then suddenly, she stopped speaking.“What happened was not a disaster. It was murder.”The day after the earthquake, Erdogan berated critics of the government’s botched earthquake response. Days later, the government admitted that the rescue effort had fallen short and issued a public apology.Criticism of the government soon became dominated by the issue of building standards, which have been relaxed since Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) took power. In the weeks after the quake, the government rounded up dozens of contractors, construction inspectors and project managers for violating construction rules.Critics dismissed the arrests as scapegoating. Relaxed building regulations were at the heart of the construction boom that turbocharged Erdogan’s 20-year rule, they argued, and the aftermath of the earthquake serves as an indictment of the country’s strongman leader.Yet in the Erdogan strongholds that pepper the earthquake zone of southeast Turkey, those criticisms may have largely fallen on deaf ears.Polls give the opposition coalition candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu a slight national lead over Erdogan (earthquake zone polling data is hard to come by). Kılıçdaroğlu may be boosted further by the late withdrawal from the race of a minor candidate, Muharrem Ince. But at least one pollster, Can Selcuki from Istanbul Economics Research, says that the government’s earthquake response has done little to sway voters.“This is the most tense moment I have seen in Turkish society,” said Asli Aydıntaşbaş, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. ”(The elections) are going to be about the future direction of the country and two radically different visions of where Turkey will go. And the opposition is galvanized.”For Aydıntaşbaş, the earthquake may have entrenched those deep divisions. Opposition-leaning communities are angrier than ever at Erdogan, while his support base has embraced the ruling party’s main talking point: mistakes were made at the beginning and now only Erdogan can rebuild what was destroyed.“More than anything else, the earthquake consolidates the two sides,” said Aydıntaşbaş.Outside her government-provided tent in Kahramanmaras, a headscarf-wearing middle-aged woman smiles furtively at passersby while she reads the Quran. Nuray Canpolat’s neighbors at the tent park appear to be in a jovial mood, singing pro-Erdogan chants and brandishing the ruling party’s flags.Kahramanmaras is the epicenter of the earthquake and a conservative Erdogan powerbase.Nuray says she tried to hold out in her damaged apartment for weeks before she resigned herself to leaving.  “All I wish for is a home. But I know that since I’m only a tenant in my apartment, I’ll be one of the last to recover what I lost,” she says.At first glance, Kahramanmaras seems to have rumbled back to life. Cars fill the streets, and people have flocked back to the main bazaars. Many here see this as proof that the government will deliver on promises to rebuild quickly. Erdogan campaign posters line the streets with the slogan: Right man, for the right time.Most of the buildings here are either destroyed or too dangerous to live in. Tent parks pepper the hillside city, which boasts picturesque mountain views.“I will of course vote for President Erdogan,” Nuray says, her hand covering her blackened teeth as she smiles. “People make mistakes and you’ve got to love people despite their mistakes.“First, God saves us. Then our President Erdogan saves us.”That appeal to faith in the Turkish leader echoes throughout the city. For many here, the slow earthquake response and recent financial crisis – which caused prices to soar and the currency to plummet – pale in comparison to Erdogan’s achievements in the first half of his two-decade rule.The early years of Erdogan’s leadership saw millions lifted out of poverty. He scrapped secularist policies that repressed expressions of faith, such as the banning of the hijab in universities. Erdogan’s combative foreign policy has endowed Turkey with a muscular posture, his supporters argue, even if his international adventurism was perceived as reckless at times.Many here say that they must repay a debt to him with loyalty that not even a massive earthquake could shake.“Is there any leader in any other country so loved as President Erdogan?” says one shopkeeper at the Kahramanmaras Bazaar.Another merchant chimes in: “There is no way he will lose this election. Tayyip, Tayyip, Tayyip all the way. He will get 60% of the vote.”Hanifi Güler, 53, says he lost 25 members of his extended family when a large apartment block collapsed in the quake. “The president thankfully said he would pay and I believe him,” he says. “The government has done the best it can do.”Yet there are a few dissenting voices. Hasan Bilir, a bearded elderly man who has always voted for Erdogan, says his trust in the president has hit its limits.“They see Erdogan as a saint. It’s too much. I survive on earthquake aid. I will vote for neither him nor the other candidate,” he says, referring to Kılıçdaroğlu.“This earthquake isn’t going to make anyone vote differently,” says 48-year-old Salih Yenikomşu, a jeweler and opposition supporter. “People believe in him and believe he is beyond reproach.”Beneath the veneer of normalcy here, the cracks are beginning to show. As night falls, the bustling marketplaces give way to food banks. Many merchants return not to their homes, but to tents or, if they’re lucky, a zinc container.One middle-aged man spits in the direction of an Erdogan poster. “I lost my wife, my son and my two grandsons,” he says. “I was a staunch supporter of the AK Party but now I spit on him. A lot of us do.“We trusted them just because they were Muslims.”One first-time voter, Ziya Kahveci, says he prefers to stay away from politics. He even raises the specter of “riots on election night.”“I have close friends who said that they’re going to take to the streets and riot if the governing party loses,” he says.Fears of violence have peaked in recent days after pro-government youth pelted an opposition rally with stones last weekend.“I cannot convince my friends to not take to the streets. They yell at me. I can’t even speak to them about the election. The polarization in this country is so deep,” he says.“On election night, I’m going to chain the door of both my apartment and the building.”Back in Hatay, where the vote is typically split between loyalists and secular opposition groups, the government’s presence is barely visible. The city is a ghost town with no building left unscathed. Ottoman-era arches protruding from heaps of rubble are the only remaining testaments to its rich history.New cemeteries outside the city stretch for hundreds of meters, mostly with unmarked graves. DNA samples are collected here to help family members identify thousands of people still unaccounted for.Sometimes, those burying the dead will leave clues. In Narlıca cemetery, the wooden plank on grave number 236 is draped with a white dress worn by a child who was not more than two years old.“We feel like the living dead. I feel like a balloon blowing in the wind,” says Meltem Canımoğlu, the sister-in-law of Bedi Değirmenci, who was stuck under the rubble in Hatay.She still sends text messages to her dead parents. She lost her six-year-old son, too, as well as her sister, Bedi’s wife.Meltem’s husband, Ayhan, sits with a quiet dignity next to his weeping wife. He says he’s determined to take his grief to the ballot box and cast his vote for Kılıçdaroğlu.“The ballot box is the only way to hold officials to account,” he says.“We hope to slam the doors of hell shut.”",world,0.0
334,358,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/world/stratosphere-sounds-scn/index.html,Mysterious rumblings were recorded in Earth’s stratosphere,2023-05-12 03:26:00,"Giant solar balloons were sent 70,000 feet up in the air to record sounds of Earth’s stratosphere — and the microphones picked up some unexpected sounds.The stratosphere is the second layer of Earth’s atmosphere, and its lower level contains the ozone layer that absorbs and scatters the sun’s ultraviolet radiation, according to NASA. The thin, dry air of the stratosphere is where jet aircraft and weather balloons reach their maximum altitude, and the relatively calm atmospheric layer is rarely disturbed by turbulence.Daniel Bowman, principal scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, was inspired in graduate school to explore the soundscape of the stratosphere after being introduced to the low-frequency sounds that are generated by volcanoes. Known as infrasound, the phenomenon is inaudible to the human ear.Bowman and his friends had previously flown cameras on weather balloons “to take pictures of the black sky above and the Earth far below” and successfully built their own solar balloon.He proposed attaching infrasound recorders to balloons to record the sounds of volcanoes. But then he and his adviser Jonathan Lees of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, “realized that no one had tried to put microphones on stratospheric balloons for half a century, so we pivoted to exploring what this new platform could do,” Bowman said. Lees is a professor of Earth, marine and environmental sciences who researches seismology and volcanology.The balloons can take sensors twice as high as commercial jets can fly.“On our solar balloons, we have recorded surface and buried chemical explosions, thunder, ocean waves colliding, propeller aircraft, city sounds, suborbital rocket launches, earthquakes, and maybe even freight trains and jet aircraft,” Bowman said via email. “We’ve also recorded sounds whose origin is unclear.”The findings were shared Thursday at the 184th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Chicago.A recording shared by Bowman from a NASA balloon that circled Antarctica contains infrasound of colliding ocean waves, which sounds like continual sighing. But other crackles and rustling have unknown origins.In the stratosphere, “there are mysterious infrasound signals that occur a few times per hour on some flights, but the source of these is completely unknown,” Bowman said.Bowman and his collaborators have conducted research using NASA balloons and other flight providers, but they decided to build their own balloons, each spanning about 19.7 to 23 feet (6 to 7 meters) across.The supplies can be found at hardware and pyrotechnic supply stores, and the balloons can be assembled on a basketball court.“Each balloon is made of painter’s plastic, shipping tape, and charcoal dust,” Bowman said via email. “They cost about $50 to make and a team of two can build one in about 3.5 hours. One simply brings it out to a field on a sunny day and fills it up with air, and it will carry a pound of payload to about 70,000 ft.”The charcoal dust is used inside the balloons to darken them, and when the sun shines on the dark balloons, the air inside them warms up and becomes buoyant. The inexpensive and easy DIY design means the researchers can release multiple balloons to collect as much data as possible.“Really, a group of high schoolers with access to the school gym could build a solar balloon, and there’s even a cellphone app called RedVox that can record infrasound,” Bowman said.Bowman estimated that he launched several dozen solar balloons to collect infrasound recordings between 2016 and April of this year. Microbarometers, originally designed to monitor volcanoes, were attached to the balloons to record low-frequency sounds.The researchers tracked their balloons using GPS, since they can travel for hundreds of miles and land in inconvenient locations.The longest flight so far was 44 days aboard a NASA helium balloon, which recorded 19 days worth of data before the batteries on the microphone died. Meanwhile, solar balloon flights tend to last about 14 hours during the summer and land once the sun sets.The advantage of the high altitude reached by the balloons means that noise levels are lower and the detection range is increased — and the whole Earth is accessible. But the balloons also present challenges for researchers. The stratosphere is a harsh environment with wild temperature fluctuations between heat and cold.“Solar balloons are a bit sluggish, and we’ve wrecked a few on bushes when trying to launch them,” Bowman said. “We’ve had to hike down into canyons and across mountains to get our payloads. Once, our Oklahoma State colleagues actually had a balloon land in a field, spend the night, and launch itself back in the air to fly another whole day!”Lessons learned from multiple balloon flights have somewhat eased the process, but now the greatest challenge for researchers is identifying the signals recorded during the flights.“There are many flights with signals whose origin we do not understand,” Bowman said. “They are almost certainly mundane, maybe a patch of turbulence, a distant severe storm, or some sort of human object like a freight train — but it’s hard to tell what is going on sometimes due to the lack of data up there.”Sarah Albert, a geophysicist at Sandia National Laboratories, has investigated a “sound channel” — a conduit that carries sounds across great distances through the atmosphere — located at the altitudes Bowman studies. Her recordings have captured rocket launches and other unidentified rumblings.“It may be that sound gets trapped in the channel and echoes around until it’s completely garbled,” Bowman said. “But whether it is near and fairly quiet (like a patch of turbulence) or distant and loud (like a faraway storm) is not clear yet.”Bowman and Albert will continue to investigate the aerial sound channel and try to determine where the stratosphere’s rumbles are originating — and why some flights record them while others don’t.Bowman is eager to understand the soundscape of the stratosphere and unlock key features, like variability across seasons and locations.It’s possible that helium-filled versions of these balloons could one day be used to explore other planets like Venus, carrying scientific instruments above or within the planet’s clouds for a few days as a test flight for larger, more complex missions.",travel,0.0
335,359,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/europe/prigozhin-russia-ukraine-bakhmut-intl/index.html,Wagner boss steps up his online tantrum as Bakhmut battle rages. What does it mean?,2023-05-12 03:08:00,"What’s eating Yevgeny Prigozhin?In recent days, the boss of the Russian private military company Wagner seems to have gone into social-media meltdown, flooding his Telegram channel and other accounts with ever-more outrageous and provocative statements.Among other things, Prigozhin revealed an apparently humiliating battlefield setback for Russia, fulminating this week that a Russian brigade had “fled” around eastern city of Bakhmut, threatening his troops with encirclement by the Ukrainian forces.“The situation on the western flanks is developing according to the worst of the predicted scenarios,” Prigozhin complained in an audio message released Thursday. “Those territories that were liberated with the blood and lives of our comrades … are abandoned today almost without any fight by those who are supposed to hold our flanks.”Earlier in the week, Prigozhin marred Russia’s May 9 Victory Day celebrations with public and profanity-laced criticisms of the country’s top military brass.“Today they [Ukrainians] are tearing up the flanks in the Artemovsk [Bakhmut] direction, regrouping at Zaporizhzhia. And a counteroffensive is about to begin,” he said Tuesday. “Victory Day is the victory of our grandfathers. We haven’t earned that victory one millimeter.”And then there was a more cryptic comment that raised eyebrows on social media. Continuing a longstanding public complaint that Russia’s uniformed military was starving his troops of shells, Prigozhin suggested that the higher-ups were dithering while Wagner fighters died.“The shells are lying in warehouses, they are resting there,” he said. “Why are the shells lying in the warehouses? There are people who fight, and there are people who have learned once in their lives that there must be a reserve, and they save, save, save those reserves. … No one knows what for. Instead of spending a shell to kill the enemy, they kill our soldiers. And happy grandfather thinks this is okay.”That begged the question: Whom, exactly, is Prigozhin referring to? After all, “grandfather in the bunker” is one of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s favorite monikers for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who inhabits an almost cartoonishly extreme security bubble.So what, exactly, was Prigozhin driving at? Is he flirting with defenestration? Or is he simply at the end of his tether, after spending months on the front lines?Prigozhin quickly backpedalled on his “grandfather” comment, recording a subsequent voice memo clarifying that he might be referring to the former Defense Minister Deputy Mikhail Mizintsev or Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov (or, more bizarrely, pro-war blogger Nataliya Khim).“I spoke about a ‘grandpa’ in the context of the fact that we are not given shells which are kept in warehouses, and who can be a grandpa?” Prigozhin said in a Telegram voice memo. “Option number one, Mizintsev, who was fired for giving us shells and therefore now he cannot give shells. The second is the General Chief of Staff, Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov, who is supposed to provide shells, but we do not receive enough shells, and we receive only 10%.”A bit of context is in order here. For months, the boss of the Wagner private military company has seen his political star rise in Russia as his fighters seemed to be the only ones capable of delivering tangible battlefield progress in the grinding war of attrition in eastern Ukraine. And he has used his social-media clout to lobby for what he wants, including those sought-after ammunition supplies.But amid those successes — particularly in the meatgrinder of Bakhmut — Prigozhin has revived and amplified a feud with Russia’s military leadership. A canny political entrepreneur, Prigozhin has cast himself as a competent, ruthless patriot — in contrast with Russia’s inept military establishment.It may seem surprising in a country where criticizing the military can potentially cost a person a spell in prison that Prigozhin gets away with strident criticism of Putin’s generals. But Putin presides over what is often described as a court system, where infighting and competition among elites is in fact encouraged to produce results, as long as the “vertical of power” remains loyal to and answers to the head of state.But Prigozhin’s online tantrums to be crossing the line to open disloyalty, some observers say.In a recent Twitter thread, the Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War said, “If the Kremlin does not respond to Prigozhin’s escalating attacks on Putin it may further erode the norm in Putin’s system in which individual actors can jockey for position and influence (and drop in and out of Putin’s favor) but cannot directly criticize Putin.”Speculation then centers on whether Prigozhin is politically expendable, whether his outbursts are a sort of clever deception operation — or, more troublingly for Putin, whether the system of loyalty that keeps the Kremlin running smoothly is starting to break down.“This isn’t meant to happen in Putin’s system,” said Cold War historian and Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies professor Sergey Radchenko in a recent Twitter thread. “Putin’s system allows for minions to attack each other but never undermine the vertical. Prigozhin is crossing this line. Either Putin responds and Prigozhin is toast or — if this doesn’t happen — a signal will be sent right through. A signal that the boss has been fatally weakened. And this is a system that does not respect weakness.”That theory will be tested in the coming days, as the battles continue to rage around Bakhmut.",world,0.0

Two further victims were evacuated with stress symptoms,” MDA said in a statement.“When we arrived on scene we saw massive destruction, we immediately went in to search the apartments, in a third floor apartment we found an unconscious male victim with a severe multi-trauma injury, and could only pronounce him dead,” said Magen David Adom (MDA) EMTs Yedidya Hakmon and Tomer Pashko.An 82-year-old woman was wounded after a rocket fired from Gaza hit the yard of her house in the Negev region in Israel on Thursday, it said in a later statement.At least 547 rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel as of 2:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET), according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), as Palestinian militants retaliated against ongoing heavy airstrikes from the Israeli military. The IDF has been targeting what it says are Islamic Jihad operatives and infrastructure along the strip since Tuesday.Four leaders of the Palestinian militant organization have so far died in the bombardments. Al-Quds Brigades Commander Ali Hassan Ghali, who was in charge of the Al-Quds Brigades rocket unit, died in the strikes Thursday morning, the militant group said in a statement.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had already tweeted early Thursday that they had “targeted Ali Ghali, the commander of Islamic Jihad’s Rocket Launching Force,” along with what they said were two other Islamic Jihad operatives in Gaza.Among the 30 Palestinians killed since Tuesday, 15 people died on Tuesday, seven people on Wednesday, and six on Thursday, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.A further 93 people have been injured since airstrikes on Gaza started at dawn on Tuesday, including 32 children, the ministry added.Meanwhile, talks about a ceasefire between Israel and Islamic Jihad have stalled, a diplomatic source briefed on the talks told CNN Thursday. The source asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the diplomatic discussions.Ghali was one of the founders of the militant group’s rocket unit, with more than 20 years of experience with rockets, the Islamist group said Thursday.Ali Hassan Ghali was in charge of the unit in the militant organization’s al Quds Brigades when he was killed, they said.He was born in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip in 1975 and joined Islamic Jihad in the early 90s, they said.Ghali supervised training militants in launching rockets and himself manufactured rocket launchers, Islamic Jihad said.He became head of the unit and a member of the al Quds Brigades military council in 2019 when his predecessor, Khaled Mansour, was killed.Ghali had survived several previous assassination attempts, Islamic Jihad said.His brother Mahmoud Ghali and his nephew Mohammad Mansour were killed alongside him at his sister’s house, the group said.Tensions between Israeli and Palestinian forces have skyrocketed in the past week, after a prominent Palestinian detainee died while he was on hunger strike in an Israeli prison.Islamic Jihad fired more than 100 rockets towards Israel last Tuesday in response to the death of Khader Adnan, a former spokesman for the militant group who became a symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli detention policies.Israel has since been striking Islamic Jihad targets using unmanned drones for surveillance as it monitors militant preparations to propel rockets, IDF chief spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Wednesday.Palestinian militant groups have also claimed responsibility for launching rockets towards Israel as a result.The Israeli military exchanged heated barbs with Islamic Jihad over Palestinian civilians killed in the strikes, as humanitarian bodies sounded the alarm on the high civilian death toll in Gaza.Israel said on Thursday that four of the Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, including children, were killed by Islamic Jihad rockets that fell short and landed in the strip – a claim which Islamic Jihad rejected as a “lie.”IDF chief spokesman Hagari said the four were killed “as a result of failed rocket launches by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization.”Approximately a quarter of all rockets launched since Wednesday fell inside the Gaza Strip, the IDF said.Another IDF spokesman, Maj. Nir Dinar, told CNN the military was “100% certain” that the four deaths were caused by Islamic Jihad rocket fire.Islamic Jihad rejected the accusation that it was responsible for any Palestinian deaths.“This is a lie,” the militant group told CNN Thursday. “We didn’t record any mistakes from our side. All Palestinian victims were killed as a result of the Israeli army aggression. Israel is making those allegations to cover its crimes.”On Wednesday, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties to exercise “maximum restraint” over the heavy bloodshed in Gaza.“The Secretary-General condemns the civilian loss of life, including that of children and women, which he views as unacceptable and must stop immediately,” a statement by Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the Secretary-General, said.“Israel must abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law, including the proportional use of force and taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in the conduct of military operations. “The statement added the Secretary-General also condemns the “indiscriminate launch” of rockets from Gaza into Israel, adding it “violates international humanitarian law and puts at risk both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.”Meanwhile, Egyptian and Qatari officials said they were separately engaging in talks to reach a ceasefire in Gaza – but to no avail.",world,0.0

Rajaratman School of International Studies in Singapore.“Delivering these sorts of threats further undermines confidence and drives up regional tensions,” he added.James Brown, professor of political science at Temple University in Japan, said the timing of the Chinese naval activity before the G7 summit in Hiroshima is important.“While much of the focus in Hiroshima will be on Ukraine, the Japanese hosts will seek to link the issue to security in East Asia,” Brown said.“Prime Minister Kishida is likely to reiterate his message that ‘Ukraine today could be East Asia tomorrow.’ By ‘East Asia,’ he means the prospect of China attacking Taiwan,” Brown said.“The Chinese show of force is intended to deter Japan from deepening security cooperation with the United States and other Western partners. It is likely to achieve the opposite,” he said.",world,0.0
338,362,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/world/thunder-beasts-evolution-size-scn/index.html,"How did massive prehistoric ‘thunder beasts’ get super big, super fast?",2023-05-11 18:53:00,"Very large things often have small beginnings. That certainly was true for brontotheres, the enormous, rhino-like herbivorous mammals that lumbered across North America and Asia during the Eocene Epoch. Brontotheres started out as dog-size animals, but then most species evolved to become nearly as large as elephants, and they did so relatively quickly because smaller species were outcompeted into extinction, researchers recently discovered.In fact, brontotheres likely hadn’t reached the limits of how big they could get. They might have produced species that were even more massive, had they not all gone extinct due to environmental changes, scientists reported Thursday in the journal Science.Brontotheres are relatives of modern rhinos, horses and tapirs. Most brontothere species weighed over 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms), and the biggest lived in the South Dakota Badlands, measuring about 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall and 16 feet (4.9 meters) long, with giant Y-shaped horns on their noses, according to the National Park Service.The name Brontotherium — “thunder beast,” coined in the 19th century by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh — was inspired by Lakota oral histories about violent thunderstorms accompanied by giants, the park service says.The earliest known brontotheres appeared about 53 million years ago; they were hornless and about the size of a coyote, weighing around 40 pounds (18 kilograms), the scientists reported. That modest size wasn’t unusual for mammals at the time. Previously, during the Mesozoic era (252 million to 66 million years ago), mammals living in the shadow of dinosaurs were typically no bigger than a badger. The dinosaurs’ reign ended when an asteroid impact triggered a mass extinction that wiped out 75% of life on Earth, and mammals that survived the carnage were rat-size on average.But that would soon change. Once large dinosaurs were out of the picture, mammals began to fill those ecological niches, and brontotheres were especially successful at quickly evolving to be enormous. Just 16 million years after the first brontotheres appeared, “the last members of this group were multi-ton behemoths with extravagant bony protrusions over the head,” lead study author Oscar Sanisidro said in an email.“What makes this group even more interesting is that it is the first in mammalian history to be consistently big,” said Sanisidro, who conducted the research while at the University of Alcalá in Spain and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Valencia.The fossil record shows that other extinct animal groups also steadily gained size over time, an evolutionary phenomenon called “Cope’s Rule” after the 19th century paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Many early scientists argued that brontotheres got bigger as a result of “an inner motor pushing evolution towards attaining the largest and most specialized forms,” said Pasquale Raia, a paleontologist and a professor at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy. In other words: Give animals enough time, and evolution toward large size is inevitable, regardless of environmental factors.Other scientists later proposed that size increases were instead shaped as species adapted to environmental pressures such as food availability, competition for resources and presence of predators, but they struggled to define what might lead to rapid and extreme growth, said Raia, who was not involved in the research.For their investigation into brontothere size evolution, the authors examined evidence from the group’s rich fossil record, which represents most of its evolutionary history. The researchers also generated computer models to track details of how genetic traits in brontothere species changed as the group evolved. Through phylogenetic analysis — evaluating the evolutionary pathways of how new species take shape — the scientists could then determine how such changes might be linked to increases in body size.They found an important clue in extinction patterns across species. Their data showed that body size evolved in both directions in brontotheres — sometimes new species would be smaller, and sometimes they would be bigger. But smaller species were more prone to extinction than their larger cousins, and a trend emerged in which increasingly larger species persisted longer than smaller species did.“By the late Eocene, all the remaining species were giants,” Sanisidro said. This pattern hinted that megaherbivory — becoming large herbivores — benefited brontotheres; perhaps smaller brontothere species were more vulnerable to competition from fellow plant-eaters and predation from carnivores, the authors reported.“We can, for the first time, explain brontothere size evolution from an evolutionary perspective and propose a ‘pathway’ to reach megaherbivory that needs to be tested in other mammalian groups,” Sanisidro said.The study provides “a fresh new look to an old and incredibly attractive question: what drives the evolution of body size,” and it “makes an exceptional move” toward identifying the external conditions that drove brontotheres to be huge, Raia said in an email.However, these herbivorous titans lost their survival edge when the Eocene’s humid greenhouse conditions started winding down. As the climate became progressively drier, previously lush ecosystems became less favorable for the thunder beasts, eventually causing their extinction.Further research modeling ecological factors, such as the rate of ancient climate shifts and how that affected abundance of edible vegetation, “would clarify how environmental change led to the demise of the brontotheres,” the scientists said.",health,0.0
339,363,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/europe/bakhmut-counterattacks-underway-intl/index.html,"Ukraine says counterattacks effective near Bakhmut, after Wagner chief accuses Russian brigade of fleeing",2023-05-11 18:45:00,"Ukrainian forces says they are conducting “effective counterattacks” in the Bakhmut area, in comments that are in line with claims from the leader of the Russian mercenary group Wagner that Kyiv has recaptured some territory.Yevgeny Prigozhin on Wednesday accused a Russian brigade of abandoning its position in front-line Bakhmut, allowing Ukraine to seize territory. He reiterated his complaints on Thursday, saying areas previously captured by his fighters, at the expense of heavy casualties, were now being lost to the Ukrainians.Bakhmut is the site of a months-long assault by Russian forces, including Wagner mercenaries, that has driven thousands from their homes and left the area devastated. But despite the vast amounts of manpower Russia has poured into capturing the city, they have been unable to take total control, and on Wednesday suffered heavy losses in the area.The Russian Defense Ministry pushed back on claims that Ukrainian forces have made some breakthroughs along the front lines around Bakhmut Thursday, in an unusual late-night post on its Telegram channel.“The statements spread by individual telegram channels about ‘defense breakthroughs’ in various sections of the line of contact are not true,” the ministry said on Telegram.“Thanks to our well-thought-out defense in the Bakhmut sector, we are getting results from the effective actions of our units,” the commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Telegram Wednesday.“In particular, we are conducting effective counterattacks. In some areas of the front, the enemy was unable to withstand the onslaught of Ukrainian defenders and retreated to a distance of up to 2 kilometers.”“Despite a significant concentration of troops and loud statements by Russian war criminals about their intentions to take Bakhmut by May 9, the enemy failed to capture the Ukrainian city. Our defense forces are holding the frontline securely and preventing the enemy from advancing. The battle for Bakhmut continues.”At least two Russian military bloggers have reported a deteriorating situation for Russian forces around the city of Bakhmut.The Russian Defense Ministry on Friday said that assault units continued “to liberate the western part” of the city with air and artillery support. A battle “is currently underway to repel an attack by the AFU unit in the direction of Maloilyinovka,” apparently a reference to a village within the Bakhmut area. “The enemy suffers significant losses in manpower and hardware,” it said.The Ministry said that other attacks in two parts of the Donetsk region had been “thwarted.”Prigozhin also accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of lying, after he remarked that Kyiv still needs “a bit more time” before it launches a much anticipated counteroffensive.“Zelensky is lying,” Prigozhin said on his official social media channels Thursday. “The counteroffensive is in full swing.”Ukrainian military officials have previously said the counterattacks around Bakhmut mentioned by Prigozhin are part of a “positional struggle,” and not necessarily related to a larger counteroffensive effort.In a Telegram message on Thursday Prigozhin said: “The situation on the western flanks is developing according to the worst of the predicted scenarios. Those territories that were liberated with blood and lives of our comrades every day progressing by dozens or hundreds of meters during many months, today are abandoned almost without any fight by those who are supposed to hold our flanks,” he said.Prigozhin’s perspective is in stark contrast to the views of one Ukrainian battalion commander in the area, who told CNN that it was Russian regular forces that were putting up the stiffest resistance, while Wagner units had been the first to run.Prigozhin has also indicated that Ukrainian forces have been able to advance south of Bakhmut.He had earlier fumed that a Russian brigade “fled” from Bakhmut area, allowing Ukrainians to seize kilometers of territory. In comments Tuesday, Prigozhin said that “one of the units of the Ministry of Defense fled from one of our flanks, abandoning their positions. They all fled and [laid] bare a front nearly 2 kilometers wide and 500 meters deep.”Prighozhin said that the “72nd brigade f***ed up three square kilometers today, on which I had about 500 people killed. Because it was a strategic bridgehead. They just ran the hell out of there.”He also blamed another private military contractor, known as “The Blue Torch,” for the reverse, saying it  “scattered just like the 72nd Brigade did.”“Instead of fighting, we have intrigues spinning all the time. We have a ministry of intrigue instead of a Ministry of Defense. That’s why we have an army running,” Prigozhin added.The 72nd Brigade (or Separate Motorized Regiment as it is sometimes called) is part of the Russian military’s Western Military District.As for soldiers fleeing, Prigozhin said: “That’s not the soldiers’ problem. It is the problem of those who manage them and who set the tasks. The fish rots from the head. A soldier leaves the trenches because it is not necessary to die [as] useless. A soldier may die, but a soldier should not die because of the utter stupidity of his leadership.”The developments mark dramatic turn of events in an area where gains and losses have usually been measured in a few meters.According to one well-known Russian military blogger in the area, the task of defending the flanks around Bakhmut was passed to regular Russian forces, while Wagner has consolidated its presence in the city itself.One Ukrainian commander in the Bakhmut area said Thursday that Ukrainian units had struck at the Russians’ flanks and the enemy had retreated.Taras Deyak of the Karpatska Sich tactical group told Radio Liberty: “The enemy’s flanks are cracking. Our intelligence has been watching and reporting on this. Indeed, a number of measures were planned and are still in progress.”“We are so to say unclenching the pincers” – a reference to the attempts by Russian forces since the beginning of the year to squeeze Bakhmut.“This allowed us to enter the city and facilitated our logistics,” Deyak said, while acknowledging that “the situation in the city of Bakhmut is very difficult, very tense and at times uncontrollable, to tell the truth.”“The enemy has indeed occupied a very large part of the city. In fact, we control about 15% of Bakhmut. But we are holding on and we are holding the high-rise buildings - it is strategic.”Deyak also dismissed claims made by Prigozhin that his fighters were deprived of munitions, saying Russian “artillery is hitting hard, the shelling is 24/7.” He also said that “new forces are arriving, these are regular forces of the Russian Armed Forces, who do not yet understand the situation in the city. We know this because we killed a lot of them as well as and took them prisoners.”Deyak claimed that “Prigozhin is now amassing large forces in the city because he wants a political victory, to take the city politically. But he is running out of cannon fodder, so he is pulling up his cannon fodder from the flanks, and handing over the defense there to the regular units of the Russian Armed Forces.”According to the Institute for the Study of War, geolocated footage published since Tuesday also showed that “Ukrainian forces likely conducted successful limited counterattacks north of Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut) and northwest of Bila Hora (14km southwest of Bakhmut) and made marginal advances in these areas.”The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that Airborne Forces (VDV) are constraining the actions of Ukrainian forces on the flanks around Bakhmut. However, other Russian units assigned to the Bakhmut area appear to have fared less well, including the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, which has lost hundreds of soldiers, according to Ukrainian estimates.The ISW says that the 72nd “is emblematic of many of the endemic force generation issues constantly faced by the Russian military.” A brigade largely formed of volunteers last year, it was reported to have been severely depleted during Ukraine’s sudden offensive in Kharkiv last September.",world,0.0
340,364,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/americas/joran-van-der-sloot-natalee-holloway-extradition/index.html,The prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba will be extradited to the US,2023-05-11 18:29:00,"The prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of the late American teen Natalee Holloway will be extradited to the US to face extortion and fraud charges, said officials in Peru, where Joran van der Sloot has been serving time for the murder of a Peruvian woman.Peru “decided to agree to the request for temporary surrender … (of van der Sloot) … for his prosecution in the United States for the alleged commission of the crimes of extortion and fraud” against Holloway’s mother, Justice and Human Rights Minister Daniel Maurate Romero said in a statement Wednesday.Van der Sloot was among the last to see Holloway alive 13 years ago in Aruba. Separately, he was convicted in 2012 of murdering Stephany Flores, 21, in his Lima hotel room and sentenced to 28 years in prison.A Dutch national, van der Sloot has been indicted in the US on federal charges of extortion and wire fraud in connection with a plot to sell information about the whereabouts of Holloway’s remains in exchange for $250,000, officials said.The missing 18-year-old’s mother, Beth Holloway, wired $15,000 to a bank account van der Sloot held in the Netherlands and through an attorney gave him another $10,000 in person, the indictment states. Once he had the initial $25,000, van der Sloot showed the attorney, John Kelly, where Natalee Holloway’s remains allegedly were hidden, but the information turned out to be false, the indictment states.The indictment seeks for van der Sloot to forfeit $25,100, including $100 Beth Holloway initially transferred to van der Sloot to confirm his account.Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving a nightclub in Aruba with van der Sloot and two other men.The three men – van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe – were arrested in 2005 and released due to insufficient evidence. They were rearrested and charged in 2007 for “involvement in the voluntary manslaughter of Natalee Holloway or causing serious bodily harm to Natalee Holloway, resulting in her death,” Aruban prosecutors said at the time.But a few weeks later, an Aruban judge ordered van der Sloot’s release, citing a lack of direct evidence that Holloway died from a violent crime or that van der Sloot was involved in such a crime. The Kalpoe brothers were also released.Holloway’s body has not been found. An Alabama judge signed an order in 2012 declaring her legally dead.Van der Sloot’s extradition from Peru to the US was expected to begin Thursday, said George Seymore, CEO of Patriot Strategies, which represents the Holloway family. But Maximo Altez, Joran van der Sloot’s lawyer in Peru, told CNN en Español he will appeal Peru’s extradition decision to face charges in the United States.Van der Sloot would be returned to Peru after legal proceedings against him conclude in the United States, Peru’s judiciary said.“The requesting country must keep the defendant in custody during the entire (duration of) proceedings in its territory,” the Peruvian judiciary announced on social media. “Once the criminal proceedings against (van der Sloot) conclude, he will immediately be returned to the Peruvian authorities.”The US State Department would not confirm details of van der Sloot’s extradition “as a matter of long-standing practice” in such cases, an agency spokesperson said.News of van der Sloot’s impending arrival in the US brought long-awaited relief to Holloway’s family.“In May 2005 my 18-year-old daughter Natalee Holloway left Birmingham for Aruba to attend her high school graduation trip and was never seen again,” mother Beth Holloway said in a family statement released Wednesday.“I was blessed to have had Natalee in my life for 18 years, and as of this month, I have been without her for exactly 18 years,” the statement said. “She would be 36 years old now. It has been a very long and painful journey, but the persistence of many is going to pay off. Together, we are finally getting justice for Natalee.”Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey called the suspect’s imminent extradition to Holloway’s hometown of Birmingham “significant.”“Criminals like him are deceptive & vicious. Alabama moms like Beth Holloway are stronger,” Ivey tweeted Thursday. “Her commendable persistence to obtain justice for Natalee is FINALLY paying off.”Peru has an extradition treaty with the US and previously had agreed to extradite van der Sloot only after he finished serving the murder sentence, the Peruvian news agency Andina reported, meaning US officials may have had to wait until 2038.Beth Holloway thanked Peru’s new president and supporters near and far.“I want to express my sincere gratitude to President Dina Boluarte, the President of Peru, the warm people of Peru, the family of Stephany Flores, the FBI in Miami, Florida and in Birmingham, Alabama, the US Attorney’s office in Birmingham, the US Embassy in Peru and the Peruvian Embassy in the US, my longtime attorney John Q. Kelly who has worked tirelessly on this case, and George Seymore and Marc Wachtenheim of Patriot Strategies,” the mother said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported no one was ever charged in Holloway’s death.",world,0.0
341,365,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/americas/mexico-ciudad-juarez-on-freight-train/index.html,‘You can’t sleep here:’ On board a perilous freight train with families hoping to reach the US,2023-05-11 16:55:00,"On top of the rumbling freight train, the young man says he has been attacked and robbed. There is no shade from the burning sun in the day, nowhere to keep warm in the perishing cold of the night. But still, he says, this brutal journey is worth it.Roberto, 23, told CNN he was escaping from Honduras, where the US State Department says violent gang activity is rife and police are ineffective.“Due to crime in my country, we can’t work, we can’t do anything,” he said.Roberto is one of the tens of thousands of migrants who have been making the perilous journey to the US-Mexico border ahead of Thursday night’s expiration of the Covid-era immigration rule known as Title 42.Roberto fled the country with his two young children, he said, becoming emotional as he talked about them. “I brought them here to Mexico but they got sick, they almost died,” he said. “I had to send them back to Honduras.”Roberto was still sick himself, wearing a mask to protect others from his coughs. He said this was the seventh train he had ridden on top of in the past 12 days as he, his father and his sister tried to find a new life. His sister is 15, he said. In other circumstances, she would be celebrating her quinceañera at home with friends and family. But home, for now, was an open train car heading north.The truck contains metal construction beams, covered in plastic. There are a couple dozen people in this freight car alone, with dozens more riding on top of and within the other cars. The riders flatten cardboard boxes and use dirty clothing to try to give themselves some padding against the hard, uneven surface. But this is still the preferred kind of train car, as it at least offers some protection from falling off.“You can’t sleep here,” Roberto said as he sat, buffeted by the wind, seemingly exhausted but determined as the train neared Ciudad Juarez, the town across the international border from El Paso.He, his sister and his father, plan to try to cross into the United States this same day. They believe they have no reason not to.The lifting of the US’s Title 42 pandemic-era immigration restriction on Thursday has raised concerns that more people will try to enter the United States. Title 42 allowed officials to quickly process people arriving and send many back across the border. The reinstatement of old rules may mean heavier legal penalties, but it is expected to be a longer process.But the people on the freight train are not talking about US rule changes. Those we spoke with had the singular goal of escaping their countries and starting again in the US, whatever process they had to follow.Crossing the border is as far as Felipe and Marcela have thought. The couple said they left Colombia, ready to sacrifice themselves for the five children they left behind.“We don’t know for sure,” Felipe replied when asked where they would go. “We need to get there first, that’s the priority. Once there, we can see what to do, because we don’t have friends, family, anyone who can take us in.”They said they suffered in the heat and the cold, and were hungry and thirsty. But their worst fear was the threat of violence, especially to women.“The treatment of women is the worst and also dangerous,” Felipe said. “People get on the train, to look for women.” Marcela added: “Dangerous meaning rape, sometimes people get in looking for that.”Wind pummels the people in the rail car. Many, like Roberto, are sick and coughing. As the train passed what looked like an incinerator, there was the smell of burning trash and a massive plume of smoke. At other times, the smell of sewage is overwhelming.Travelers come from many different countries. We even met two from China.For some of them, this is not their first attempt to get into the US.Omar Zambrano said he left Venezuela six months ago to escape the crime and violence there, coupled with the economic crisis. “Living in Venezuela is chaotic. If you have breakfast, you don’t have enough money for lunch,” said Zambrano, a chef who said he would try any kind of work in the United States.He has the address of a friend in Baltimore along with a printout in Spanish of all the circumstances under which he would be allowed to stay in the US.He said he has tried and been sent back before. But he will try to cross the border again. “They ignore you when you’re trying to do it legally,” he said. “But let’s go for the legal way first to see what happens.”After clambering down from the final train stop, Zambrano picked up his small bookbag, containing all he has on the journey and prepares to head to the border crossing, walking or perhaps on a truck.“We are going to turn ourselves in, in the name of God,” he said, somehow wearing a smile under his sunglasses. “Faith moves mountains and you must not lose it.”",world,0.0
342,366,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/middleeast/idf-apology-shireen-abu-akleh-intl/index.html,Israel Defense Forces apologizes for death of Al Jazeera’s Shireen Abu Akleh for the first time,2023-05-11 16:38:00,"The Israel Defense Forces has apologized for the death of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a year to the day after she was killed by a bullet to the back of the head while covering an Israeli military operation in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.It is the first time the IDF has apologized for the killing of the well-known correspondent, after conceding last year that there was a “high possibility” she was shot by an Israeli soldier.The apology came from the IDF’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, in an interview with CNN’s Eleni Giokos on Connect the World on Thursday.“I think it’s an opportunity for me to say here that we are very sorry of the death of Shireen Abu Akleh,” he said.“She was a journalist, a very established journalist. In Israel we value our democracy and in a democracy we see high value in journalism and in a free press. We want journalists to feel safe in Israel, especially in war time, even if they criticize us,” he said.The apology comes days after The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) published a report that said it had found no accountability was taken by the Israeli military over its killings of at least 20 journalists over the past two decades.The press advocacy group said it had documented at least 20 journalists killed by Israeli military fire since 2001, adding 18 of those killed were Palestinian. “No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths,” it said in the press release.The CPJ said its report – titled ‘Deadly Pattern’ – found a “routine sequence” that takes place when a journalist is killed at the hands of the IDF.“Israeli officials discount evidence and witness claims, often appearing to clear soldiers for the killings while inquiries are still in progress,” the CPJ said, describing the IDF’s procedure for examining military killings of civilians such as journalists as a “black box,” with the results of any such probe kept confidential.“When probes do take place, the Israeli military often takes months or years to investigate killings and families of the mostly Palestinian journalists have little recourse inside Israel to pursue justice,” the CPJ said.A CNN investigation in May last year unearthed evidence – including two videos of the scene of the shooting – that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death.Footage obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggested that Israeli forces took aim at the journalist.While the IDF admitted for the first time last September that there was a “high possibility” Abu Akleh was “accidentally” shot and killed by Israeli fire, its Military Advocate General’s Office said in a statement that it did not intend to pursue criminal charges or prosecutions of any of the soldiers involved.Responding to the CPJ report earlier this month, the IDF said it “regrets any harm to civilians during operational activity and considers the protection of the freedom of the press and the professional work of journalists to be of great importance.”“The IDF does not intentionally target noncombatants, and live fire in combat is used only after all other options have been exhausted,” it said in the statement.",world,0.0
343,367,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/world/innovations-feed-the-world-scn-spc-intl/index.html,Six innovations that can help feed the world,2023-05-11 16:02:00,"When it comes to feeding the planet, we face some monumental challenges.The global population has increased from 7 billion to 8 billion in the past 12 years, and the UN projects it will reach around 10.4 billion people in the 2080s. That’s a lot of extra mouths to feed.At the same time, the climate crisis means food will become more scarce and more expensive, according to United Nation’s climate change panel, while some crops will lose their nutritional value.Rising to the challenge may take a new agricultural revolution. CNN asked three experts to outline the innovations that can help increase food production without harming the planet.An astounding 40% of the food grown globally is never eaten, according to WWF. Some is lost during and after harvest, some is lost in the supply chain, and some is wasted when it goes bad on shop shelves or in our homes.One way to extend the shelf-life of produce is to cover it in an edible plant-based coating, says Richard Munson, author of “Tech to Table: 25 Innovators Reimagining Food.”Munson gives the example of US company Apeel, which he says has created “tasteless, odorless, invisible, and edible coatings – consisting of fatty acids and other organic compounds extracted from the peels and pulp of produce – that act as a physical barrier to keep water in and oxygen out.”He says Apeel’s coatings can double the shelf-life of avocados, oranges, and other produce.Researchers in India have also developed edible coatings they say can keep food fresh for longer.For many parts of the world, climate change means water is becoming increasingly scarce, and that presents a huge problem for farmers in regions such as the Middle East, which is reliant on desalinated sea water in many places.Globally, more than 1 billion hectares (2.5 billion acres) of land – an area larger than China – – are already degraded by salinity, according to Dr. Tarifa Alzaabi, director general of the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA), a not-for-profit research organization based in Dubai.One solution is to grow crops that thrive in salty soil. She says ICBA has identified a number of salt-tolerant varieties of date palm, and is successfully cultivating Salicornia, an edible plant found in many parts of the world. Alzaabi describes it as a “desert superhero” for its ability to grow in the brine that’s created as a byproduct of the water desalination process.She adds that ICBA has also tested technologies such as hydrogels (gels that retain water) and sub-surface irrigation systems, and found they can significantly cut farmers’ water use.Around the world, food is grown on land of all sizes and all types, but that diversity means farmers often fail to take into account landscape complexity and soil variability, according to Chandra A. Madramootoo, a professor of Bioresource Engineering at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.He says that one solution is precision farming, an approach that “enables the selection of crops, and chemical and water applications within spatially similar land and soil zones.”This can be done through digital mapping, using technologies such as drones and sensors to distinguish the type and characteristics of soil. Geospatial modeling (using statistical models of soil characteristics and topography) can be used to group together areas of landscape that have similar properties.Together, this can help “sequester more carbon in agricultural ecosystems, conserve water and reduce chemical contamination in complex farming landscapes,” says Madramootoo.Alzaabi says ICBA has been using drones to collect data on its date palm plantation, and has adopted precision agriculture techniques including sensors and smart lysimeters (devices that measure moisture loss) to optimize fertilizer application and the use of irrigation water.A traditional source of protein in parts of Africa, Asia and South America, growing insects for food is becoming more mainstream elsewhere. In 2020, Nestlé launched Purina Beyond Nature’s Protein pet food, which includes insect protein, millet and fava beans. In Singapore, Insectta grows black soldier fly maggots for use in animal feed. The maggots are fed food waste, such as the byproducts of soybean factories and breweries.“Poultry and fish farms have long relied on chemicals … and irrigation to grow corn and soybeans,” says Munson. “Insects such as mealworm beetles offer alternatives. They take up little space, live happily when jammed together, survive without light, breed throughout the year, emit few pollutants or greenhouse gases, and require little feed.”“Food production is being undertaken at the expense of biodiversity losses,” says Madramootoo. One reason, he says, is a failure to take into account the “multiplicity of adjoining ecosystems.”He calls for a “wholescapes approach,” producing food sustainably across all ecosystems – coastal, marine and terrestrial, including forests, agricultural land and urban areas.“The benefits include production of protein from marine resources, integration of wetlands with aquaculture systems and fish farming, and the use of forestry systems to also produce food,” says Madramootoo, adding that agroforestry and silviculture (the management of forests) can benefit peoples’ livelihoods, increase food production, aid conservation and increase carbon stocks.Madramootoo says that a wholescapes approach can also be applied to food production in urban and peri-urban areas – the spaces immediately surrounding a city.“Trees in peri-urban and urban areas can provide food, provide shade, have a cooling effect and sequester carbon,” he says. “Rooftops … can be used to grow food. We can make use of gray water and waste energy from homes to grow food in small plots, shade houses or covered tunnels where frost is likely to occur.“In congested peri-urban areas, we can use vertical farms in warehouses or abandoned buildings, for example, to produce food. This cuts down the need for water and high-cost chemical inputs and reduces the waste stream.”Vertical farms of this kind have become more widespread in recent years. Using LEDs to grow crops indoors, without soil, these farms are heavily automated, with nutrient-rich water delivered straight to a plant’s roots.“They use no pesticides and cut water use by 95%,” says Munson of vertical farms. “They produce 100 times the output of an equivalent-sized plot of horizontal land.“With a growing season that never ends, they allow the quick delivery of fresh and organic greens to local restaurants and supermarkets throughout the year; and they offer good-paying jobs in formerly abandoned spaces within neglected neighborhoods.”",travel,0.0
344,368,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/europe/russia-victory-day-parade-moscow-intl/index.html,Putin leads scaled-back Victory Day in Moscow as war in Ukraine comes under mounting pressure,2023-05-09 10:56:00,"Russian President Vladimir Putin led a pared-down Victory Day parade in Moscow on Tuesday as he repeated his false assertion that the West had launched a “true war” against Russia, despite the Kremlin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.Thousands of people lined the streets of Moscow’s Red Square as part of Russia’s annual parade, an exhibition of patriotism marking the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II.Victory Day is the most significant day of Putin’s calendar, as he has long used it to rally public support, demonstrate the country’s military prowess and rail against the historical injustices he perceives Western nations have heaped on his nation.The Russian leader has historically led the annual military parade on Red Square with displays of military hardware including tanks, missiles, and other weapons systems, before a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin wall, to honor the memory of those who perished in the battles.More than 10,000 people and 125 units of various types of weapons and equipment were expected to be displayed at this year’s parade, according to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Last year the ministry announced 11,000 people and 131 types of weapons were involved in the military parade, with an airshow of 77 aircraft and helicopters.But there was just one ancient World War II-era T-34 tank leading the mechanized column on Tuesday, as Moscow seemingly toned down its annual parade.Tigr-M and VPK-Ural armored vehicles were also on display, but the main focus was the country’s S-400 air defense system and its intercontinental ballistic system – the Yaris.The usual fly-past above the Red Square was canceled, state media reported, without providing an explanation.Putin used the annual Victory Day parade to launch yet another scathing attack on the West,  accusing it of holding Ukraine hostage to its anti-Russian plans.“A true war has been unleashed against our motherland,” Putin said on Tuesday, claiming falsely that the West had provoked the war in Ukraine. “We have repelled international terrorism and to fit we will defend the residents of Donbas and secure our own safety. Russia has no unfriendly nations in the West or in the East.”He also again drew comparisons between the conflict in Ukraine and the fight against Nazi forces in the World War II, saying that civilization is once again at a turning point.Throughout his short address, Putin praised Russian troops fighting in what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, saying the country is “proud” of everyone who fights on the frontlines.“There is no more important thing now than your combat work,” Putin said.However, no mention was made of the high casualties suffered by Russian troops, which are estimated to be in the tens of thousands.World leaders such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan had attended the military parade in previous years. But such displays of solidarity have faded in recent years, after Putin’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 and the war in Ukraine fractured diplomatic ties.Moscow had been under pressure to strengthen its show of defenses and unity on Tuesday, after last week’s alleged drone strike on the Kremlin shattered the most powerful symbol of the Russian presidency.Kyiv and its Western allies exchanged thorny memos with Moscow after it accused Ukraine of carrying out orders from the US in an attempted assassination against Putin. Ukraine and Washington vehemently denied the allegations.The cause of the explosions is unknown, but the optics of a symbolic attack against the Kremlin gave it an opportunity to rally support for Putin from Russians as critics continue to speak out against Moscow’s full-scale invasion.Similarly, Russia’s wrath appeared neutered when a wave of drone and missile attacks was thwarted by Ukraine’s air defenses on Tuesday.Over the past week, lives have been lost and civilians injured by debris from destroyed drones, or missiles that have punctured Ukrainian resistance. But above all, Kyiv’s air-defenses have proved potent, and Moscow’s less so.On Monday, Russian oligarch Andrey Kovalev called Moscow’s military campaign “a terrible war.”“The whole world is against us,” he said in a video speech later shared on Telegram.At the same time, strained relations between senior Russian officials exploded into a public display of disunity as Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched a fiery tirade criticizing the Russian military’s focus on the Victory Day parade – ahead of an expected spring offensive from Kyiv in the south.“Today they [Ukrainians] are tearing up the flanks in the Artemovsk (Russian name for Bakhmut) direction, regrouping at Zaporizhzhia. And a counteroffensive is about to begin,” he said on his social media accounts on Tuesday.“They absolutely clearly say that the counteroffensive will be on the ground, not on TV. In our country everybody thinks that we should do everything on TV and celebrate the Victory Day.”He also chose the moment of the parade to release a statement saying in fact Russian defense ministry troops had abandoned positions around the city of Bakhmut – a key battleground in eastern Ukraine – and said he had been threatened with treason charges if he left.“Victory Day is the victory of our grandfathers,” he added. “We haven’t earned that victory one millimeter.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky compared Russia to Nazi Germany as he proposed moving Victory Day celebrations a day earlier in a bill presented to lawmakers, in an effort to distance Kyiv from the Kremlin’s celebrations.Like Russia, Ukraine traditionally commemorates victory over the Nazis on May 9, but that date has become increasingly associated with a parade in Moscow.“It is on May 8 that most nations of the world remember the greatness of the victory over the Nazis,” Zelensky said Monday.Zelensky said on Tuesday that Russia had failed to capture Bakhmut before the May 9 deadline of the Victory Day parade.“They were not able to capture Bakhmut, this was the last important military operation that they wanted to complete by the nineth of May,” Zelensky said in a joint press conference with European President Ursula von der Leyen.“Unfortunately, the city does not exist anymore everything is fully destroyed.”",world,0.0
345,369,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/europe/russia-ukraine-mala-tokmachka-zaporizhzhia-intl/index.html,Russian forces lash out indiscriminately as Ukraine increases military pressure on frontline towns,2023-05-09 00:08:00,"In this vacant and damaged village, news of Russia’s evacuation of occupied towns along the southern front cannot come soon enough.Ukrainian-held Mala Tokmachka, just over a mile (2 kilometers) from Russian-held territory in the Zaporizhzhia region, has been left ghostly and battered by shelling, leaving the central square pockmarked, and the school’s facade torn off. Shrapnel is mixed in with fallen pine cones.Raisa, a local woman passing some Ukrainian soldiers on her bicycle, said the explosions had picked up recently and she had heard small arms fire from the nearby highway. “There is no way out for us,” she said, of the remaining 200 civilians. “We have no water, gas or power for more than a year.”Just 9 miles (15 km) down the road is Polohy, a town that Russian occupiers said Friday they would evacuate, a process which local sources said had got underway at the weekend, although some Russian soldiers apparently remain in place.The town is a focus for Ukraine’s spring counteroffensive. While Kyiv has said it will not announce its commencement so as to cause maximum surprise, recent statements from Russian officials in occupied areas about attacks have indicated at least its opening stages are likely underway.Polohy is one of over a dozen frontline settlements that occupying forces announced Friday would be emptied of civilians. A Russian occupation official, Yuri Balitsky, said “we cannot risk the safety of people and will provide funds for organized travel, lump sum payments, accommodation and meals.” He added children would undergo rehabilitation and rest in children’s camps,” echoing the language of previous incidents that Ukraine has dubbed forced deportation and on which the International Criminal Court based a war crimes indictment against Russian President Vladimir Putin.Ukrainian officials have said the evacuations are being used to provide cover for the departure of Russian troops, and claimed civilians are being sent to the coastal town of Berdyansk, and Russian soldiers to the heavily destroyed city of Mariupol.It is as yet unclear what impact these evacuations – which on Sunday Russian occupation officials said amounted to 1,600 people – will have on Moscow’s ability to hold frontline towns. But it is a sign of possible weakness, and in during past Ukrainian offensives, Russian positions have collapsed very suddenly, even as their spokespeople were articulating their avowed defense. At the best, these mass departures are recognition by Russian forces that the fight ahead of them will likely be intense.The evacuees are also being moved all the way to the coastline – a reflection of the terrain to be fought over. Russia, according to satellite imagery, has built a substantial line of defenses along its southern front in the Zaporizhzhia region.Below this line of trenches and concrete, there are reports of some ongoing defenses, but not of a depth that would suggest Russia can easily afford to lose this initial frontline. Once Ukraine’s well-prepared offensive has pushed past this first boundary, there is a risk for Moscow that Kyiv’s move to the coast is a lot easier. That could be disastrous for the Russian occupation and Putin’s strategic hold of the land corridor that runs through Zaporizhzhia and connects the Crimean peninsula to the rest of occupied Ukraine and the Russian mainland.In the Ukrainian-held city of Orikihv, one of the last major population centers before this frontline, the prospect of Russian forces being pushed decisively back cannot come fast enough. A constant artillery duel busies the horizon, together with intermittent mushroom clouds from enormous, often inaccurate Russian airstrikes.Four hit on Thursday, destroying two civilian houses but apparently missing any construction that could be presumed to be a target. On Sunday morning, a CNN crew witnessed a jet flying overhead that dropped two missiles – one a $500,000 Kh31-P according to Ukrainian officials – which slammed into the town, 700 yards away. The missile appeared to have missed any potential target, causing a 10-foot-deep crater in an empty patch of land in the city center.Orikhiv is persistently battered by Russia’s rage as Ukrainian military pressure increases. The town’s rescue team said there is no longer any pattern to the shelling, which seems to strike at random times and locations. Dmytro Haydar, a rescuer, described the delicate balance his team must find between responding to strikes quickly and being caught in the regular “double-tap” follow-up attacks that Russian jets often launch to hit first-responders and survivors. “We saw them, as they leave a trail in the sky,” he said of one jet attack. “We had to stand near the basement because they launched guided bombs. There’s no particular time of day or place for the strikes.” Haydar gestured towards the recent sound of outgoing artillery fire and said: “That’s not necessarily Ukrainian. It could be from the Russian-held town of] Nesterianka.

All were taken by renowned British photographer Hugo Burnand at Buckingham Palace.One portrait shows the King photographed in the palace’s Throne Room dressed in the full regalia – the Robe of Estate and the Imperial State Crown while holding the Sovereign’s Orb and Sovereign’s Sceptre with Cross.He is seated on one of a pair of 1902 throne chairs that were built for use at King Edward VII’s coronation by future King George V and Queen Mary.In a separate portrait, Queen Camilla was photographed wearing Queen Mary’s Crown and Robe of Estate in the Green Drawing Room.The King and Queen also sat for a portrait together in the Throne Room.Finally a fourth photograph was released of the King and Queen flanked by “working royals” – members of the family who carry out official duties on behalf of the monarch.London-based Burnand has long held close ties to the royal family, having previously taken the official photos for both Charles and Camilla’s wedding in 2005, and William and Kate’s wedding in 2011. He’s also been privately taking photographs of Charles and Camilla for over two decades.Burnand also took several photos of the King and Queen released by the palace ahead of the coronation.The coronation of King Charles III on Saturday was a once-in-a-generation royal occasion, with thousands turning out in the streets of London to watch history in the making despite gloomy and wet weather conditions.The service, rich in tradition and pageantry, was held at London’s Westminster Abbey – the nation’s coronation church since 1066.Music underpinned the entire celebration, in keeping with history. Each stage was marked by either a grand choral work, an ethereal motet, an extravagant organ composition or an evocative melody, all performed by some of the most accomplished singers and musicians in the world.The Duke of Sussex flew back to the UK for his father’s big day, sitting in the third row, wearing a morning suit with his military medals. He arrived alongside his uncles, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, and two of his cousins, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.He did not appear later on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the customary appearance, instead catching a commercial flight back to Los Angeles to join the fourth birthday celebrations of his son, Prince Archie.The occasion marked the first time the prince had publicly reunited with members of his family since the release of his controversial memoir, “Spare.”The rest of the holiday weekend saw the sunshine return once more as thousands across the country took part in street parties and community lunches in celebration of the newly-crowned King. Others attended a jubilant coronation concert held in the grounds of Windsor Castle.Meanwhile on Monday, Prince Louis, the youngest child of the Prince and Princess of Wales, conducted his first royal engagement at the age of five, as part of the Big Help Out – a nationwide volunteering initiative marking the end of the coronation weekend.The youngster, who is fourth in line to the throne, joined his parents and siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, in helping to renovate a scout hut.",style,0.0

While Louis’ older siblings were seen dancing and singing along to the music at the star-studded event, Louis did not attend.A day earlier, at the coronation service in London’s Westminster Abbey, Louis stole the show during segments of the ceremony.Keen-eyed viewers may have noticed him yawning, sitting between his mother, the Princess of Wales, and his sister, but then pulling a disappearing act from the service – only to return a little later.At the late Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations last year, Louis made global headlines when he was captured throwing a tantrum and covering his ears while screaming during the flypast.",style,0.0

He added that his grandmother had called coronations a “declaration of our hopes for the future.”The coronation concert capped a day of street parties and community lunch events across the UK in celebration of King Charles III.The concert line-up was certainly fit for a King, featuring global superstars, classical music maestros and an eclectic mix of celebrity faces, from Tom Cruise to “The Muppets’” very own Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.William kicked off his speech on a humorous note, making a promise to the crowd that, unlike singer Lionel Richie, who performed at the event, he wouldn’t “go on all night long” with his address.Instead, William said he simply wanted to “say a few words about my father and why I believe this weekend is so important.”He went on to pay a heartfelt tribute to the King, outlining his commitment to service over the years.“For all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message: Service. My father’s first words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday were a pledge of service,” Prince William remarked.“It was a pledge to continue to serve. Because for over 50 years, in every corner of the UK, across the Commonwealth and around the world, he [King Charles] has dedicated himself to serve others, both current and future generations, and those whose memory must not be neglected,” the prince continued.William highlighted the King’s commitment to environmental causes, saying the King “warned us of the risks to our planet’s health long before it was an everyday issue.”He also commended the King’s charitable contributions through his foundation, the Prince’s Trust, which William said “has supported over a million young people, many from disadvantaged backgrounds, to realize their ambitions.”“Pa, we are all so proud of you,” the prince said, addressing the King directly.Prince William wrapped up his brief speech by thanking the “millions of people who serve in the forces, in classrooms, hospital wards and local communities,” giving his own pledge to “serve [them] all.”King Charles III was crowned at Westminster Abbey in London on Saturday, and well-wishers packed the streets of the British capital.After the service, the King and selected members of the royal family made the customary appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony, but a flypast of military aircraft was scaled back due to bad weather.Police arrested dozens of people during the coronation, after controversially promising a “robust” approach to protesters.",style,0.0

I am doing this for my country,” Ince said at a press conference in Ankara “I don’t want them to blame me when they lose,” he said referring to the main opposition.His centrist party, Homeland, will remain in the parliamentary race. “I urge each household to give Homeland Party at least one vote,” he said. Ince did not endorse any of the remaining candidates. His name will remain on the ballot.Ince said he had withdrawn following a “slander campaign.” He has faced weeks of lurid allegations on social media in Turkey and the Ankara public prosecutor’s office said Thursday it had opened an investigation into potential blackmail.The 59-year-old ran for president in 2018 but lost against Erdogan. In March this year, he broke away from Kilicdaroglu’s Republican People’s Party (CHP) and joined the presidential race. He initially rebuffed calls by his former party to withdraw amid concern that he’d take votes away from Erdogan’s rival.Speaking at a rally in Ankara, Erdogan said he wished Ince had not withdrawn, adding that it was “impossible to understand why” he did.Mehmet Karli, a CHP member and long-time adviser to Kilicdaroglu, told CNN that Ince’s decision is likely to be welcomed by the CHP and the wider opposition bloc. He added that while Ince may stop short of endorsing the Kilicdaroglu, the general expectation is that his backers wanted to see an end to Erdogan so will vote for the CHP leader.Turkey holds elections every five years. The candidate who receives more than 50% of votes in the first round is elected president, but if no candidate gets a majority, the election goes to a second round between the two candidates who received the highest number of votes in the first round.“As the election day became closer, all votes were converging on (Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu and) Ince’s votes were falling,” Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul, told CNN, noting that Ince’s candidacy would have likely led to a second round of elections. “He and his party did not want to take this responsibility,” he said.It is unclear how Ince’s supporters would vote, but Turkish polls have shown that a large proportion of his backers would pick Kilicdaroglu if the Homeland Party leader withdrew.The election is expected to be a close race between Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu, with pollsters predicting record voter turnouts.“Even though formally an election, this is actually a referendum and you have only two choices,” Somer said.",world,0.0

Among the casualties, 15 died Tuesday, seven Wednesday and three Thursday, according to the ministry.Israel has been bombarding Islamic Jihad’s operatives and infrastructure, using unmanned drones for surveillance as it monitors militant preparations to propel rockets, IDF chief spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Wednesday.Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that runs Gaza, issued a statement Wednesday strongly suggesting that its forces were releasing rockets toward Israel, shortly after the IDF said firmly it believed Hamas was not doing so.“The Palestinian resistance with all its factions, led by the Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades, is participating now in a unified manner by teaching the enemy a lesson that it will not forget and confirming that Palestinian blood is not cheap,” said the statement, issued by Muhammad al-Buraim, an official in the joint resistance committees in Palestine.The statement appeared designed to reject an assertion by IDF chief spokesman Hagari that the IDF saw only Islamic Jihad, not Hamas, firing rockets.More than 500 rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel in the recent barrage, according to the IDF, as of 6 a.m. local time Thursday. Of those, 154 were intercepted by Israeli missile defenses and 110 fell short, landing in Gaza.In total, the IDF said 158 Islamic Jihad sites had been struck.Civilians in Israel have been asked to act according to the special instructions posted on the National Emergency Portal.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials Wednesday downplayed the idea that a ceasefire with Islamic Jihad was imminent, with Netanyahu saying: “The campaign is not over yet.”National Security Council chair Tzachi Hanegbi said that rumors of a ceasefire were “premature,” while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant struck a slightly more optimistic note, saying: “I hope we’ll bring it to an end soon, but we’re ready for the option that it will be prolonged.”Over half a million Israelis were in or near shelters, the IDF spokesman Hagari said just after 2 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET) on Wednesday.International leaders have condemned the hostilities. The United Nations Secretary-General urged all parties to exercise “maximum restraint” over the escalation of violence in Gaza, a statement by Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the Secretary-General, said on Wednesday.“The Secretary-General condemns the civilian loss of life, including that of children and women, which he views as unacceptable and must stop immediately,” the statement said.“Israel must abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law, including the proportional use of force and taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in the conduct of military operations. “The statement added the Secretary-General also condemns the “indiscriminate launch” of rockets from Gaza into Israel, adding it “violates international humanitarian law and puts at risk both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.”Qatar has been engaged in “intensive and continuous calls” to stop Israel’s “brutal aggression” on the Gaza Strip to avoid “more losses,” the spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Egyptian state-affiliated XtraNews said there are “intensive efforts” to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, citing Egyptian sources, without clarifying which parties have been communicated with. The news was carried on Egyptian state newspaper’s Al Ahram’s website.Hamas said in a statement that the head of its political bureau, Ismail Haniya, spoke with officials from Egypt, Qatar and the UN.The Ministry of Health in Gaza said one person was killed in Wednesday’s attack. It named him as Muhammad Yusuf Saleh Abu Ta’ima, 25, and said he was killed in the bombing east of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip.A CNN producer in Gaza reported explosions in Khan Younis, Rafah and northern Gaza.Shortly after, he saw at least six rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel. Sirens warning of incoming rockets sounded in the southern Israeli cities of Sderot and Ashkelon and the Lachish area, all near the Gaza Strip, the IDF said. Sirens later sounded in Tel Aviv, Israel’s main city on the Mediterranean coast, warning of potential incoming rocket fire.Several locations in Israel suffered direct hits by rockets from Gaza, authorities said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. A rocket landed near buildings and caused extensive damage in Ashkelon, pictures distributed by Israel Fire and Rescue Authority showed. A building in Kibbutz Nir Am also was hit, and a rocket landed in the garden of a house in Sderot.One of the three Islamic Jihad commanders killed on Tuesday was working on capabilities to launch rockets from the West Bank toward Israel, IDF chief spokesman Hagari said at the time.Rockets have never been fired from the West Bank into Israel.Islamic Jihad confirmed three of its commanders were killed in the overnight operation along with their wives and children.The commanders killed were Jihad Shaker Al-Ghannam, secretary of the Military Council in the al Quds Brigades; Khalil Salah al Bahtini, commander of the Northern Region in the al Quds Brigades; and Ezzedine, one of the leaders of the military wing of the al Quds Brigades in the West Bank, the group said.Hagari said the operation had been planned since last Tuesday, when Islamic Jihad fired more than 100 rockets toward Israel following the death of its former spokesman while on hunger strike in an Israeli prison.But, the IDF did not have the “operational conditions” until overnight Tuesday.The IDF launched a further strike on Tuesday, saying its air force targeted “a terrorist squad” belonging to Islamic Jihad in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza said two people were killed and two others injured in that attack east of Khan Younis, although they have yet to identify them, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 15 on Tuesday.Gaza is one of the most densely packed places in the world, an isolated coastal enclave of almost 2 million people crammed into 140 square miles.Governed by Hamas, the territory is largely cut off from the rest of the world by an Israeli blockade of Gaza’s land, air and sea dating back to 2007.

A statement issued by the bloc on Sunday said the move “addresses the humanitarian, security and political crises in Syria, the crisis’ repercussions on neighboring countries, especially the burden of refugees, terrorism and drug smuggling.”But some are skeptical of the bloc’s ability to find a humane and just solution to the refugee crisis, warning that a rapprochement with the Syrian regime could prompt hosting nations to force the return of Syrian refugees despite potential threats to their lives.“The normalization of the Assad regime and welcoming him back into the Arab League is a step that can normalize the conversation about pushing refugees back to Syria, which is very risky,” said Omar Alshogre, a Sweden-based Syrian refugee and activist who says he was detained and tortured by Assad’s regime.Alshogre, who was smuggled out of Syria in 2015, also expressed disappointment at “the silence of Arab populations,” which he says allows their Arab governments to act without accountability.More than 14 million Syrians fled their homes looking for safety following the civil war between Assad and opposition forces who sought to unseat him. More than 300,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed. Over 6.8 million are internally displaced in Syria, two thirds of whom are women and children, according to the UN refugee agency.Syrians fled to more than 130 countries, the UN says, predominantly neighboring Turkey, which shelters more than 3.6 million. Others traveled to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt. Many fled to European countries, including Germany and Denmark.According to a 2022 UNHCR poll of Syrian refugees living in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, only 1.7% said they would return to Syria in the next 12 months. Around 93% said they would not return, and 5.6% said they did not know.Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC, told CNN that the polling data “simply cements the core reasoning for why the refugee crisis remains intractable.”“Regional states can pressure Assad to accept returns all they want, but it’s not going to change the palpable terror felt by refugees who simply won’t choose to return,” he said.Even before Arab normalization with the Assad regime began, human rights organizations had repeatedly warned that Syrian refugees risked facing forced returns home amid concerns for their safety.Earlier this year, Denmark – which hosts more than 35,000 Syrian refugees – deemed more areas controlled by the Assad regime to be safe for return.The announcement was met by condemnation from international human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, which said that “Denmark should refrain from playing into the regime’s hand.”“While active hostilities may have decreased in recent years, the Syrian government continues to subject citizens to the same abuses that led them to flee in the first place, including arbitrary detention, mistreatment, and torture,” Human Rights Watch said just two months ago.Lister said there is a real danger that “smaller numbers of deeply vulnerable refugees could be targeted for coerced returns.”“We’ve already seen this in Lebanon and Turkey, and to a limited extent in Jordan too – and that’s likely just the start,” Lister said, adding that forced refugee returns place victims at “extremely high risk of persecution by the regime, or regime-linked actors.”In neighboring Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tried to put an end to the country’s refugee issue, a move that analysts have said was intended to boost his popularity ahead of this week’s election.Earlier this year, Erdogan said that more Syrians will be returning home “as the security environment in northern Syria improves,” reported Turkish media, citing Erdogan as saying that some 550,000 refugees have so far returned to Syrian zones “cleared of terrorism and made safe.”Rights watchdogs have condemned Turkey’s push to return Syrians home, saying conditions in Syria are not safe.The Syrian government said in a joint statement with Saudi Arabia last month, that it is working with its partners to “create the necessary conditions for the return of Syrian refugees and displaced persons.” It also stressed that it is working towards “ending their suffering, enabling them to return safely to their homeland.”Some Syrians may not, however, have a choice, and pressure for their return is already mounting, especially after Sunday’s Arab League decision. “Syrian refugees are already facing pressures to return to Syria, despite it being clearly unsafe for them to do so, by third countries that would prefer they not remain,” HA Hellyer, Middle East scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN.“The further normalization goes, the deeper the pressure will be.”Alshogre worries for himself as well as other Syrian refugees. Some governments, especially those with right-wing leaders, won’t hesitate to send Syrians back if they see an opportunity, he said, adding that he and others will refuse to go back.“We will hide in the woods, we will hide under the ground, wherever,” he said. “If I am sent back to Syria, I will be cut into small pieces by the Syrian regime; I won’t make it out of the airport in Damascus.”",world,0.0

Our long arm will reach every terrorist at a time and place of our choosing,” he added.The IDF launched a further stike on Tuesday, saying its air force targeted “a terrorist squad” belonging to Islamic Jihad in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.“The squad was taking Anti-tank guided missiles by car to a launch pad in the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. IDF soldiers monitored the activity of the squad and struck it while they were on their way to the launch pad,” IDF said.The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza said two people were killed and two others injured in that attack east of Khan Younis, although they have yet to identify them, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 15.The Al Shifa hospital in Gaza said those killed in the overnight strikes were members of four families plus one other individual.The dead included five women and four children, a list of the dead released by the Al-Shifa Medical Complex showed.One of the Palestinian men killed in Israeli airstrikes was a prominent dentist, Jamal Khaswan, who died along with his wife and son, the Ministry of Health added. Khaswan was Chairman of the Board of Directors of Al-Wafa Hospital, the ministry said, praising him as a scientific and practical man of great determination.He held Russian citizenship, according to the Russian Representative Office in Ramallah. The Russian Mission said Khaswan and his wife left behind two orphaned children who are also Russian citizens.The Ministry of Health added that 20 people had been injured, including three children and seven women.When asked about civilians who were also killed in the attack, IDF spokesperson Hagari said they were not intentionally targeted.“In every operation we try to create that we will have the minimize the harm of civilians and minimize collateral damage,” Hagari said. “Unfortunately, we had women and children that were dead. We would rather have no uninvolved personnel dead in our operations but it’s hard we’re working against terrorist who are conducting their activity day and night amongst civilians. We are trying to create conditions for minimum harm of people in our operations.”Hagari said that while the IDF focused specifically on Islamic Jihad, the military is prepared for any expanded scenario.“We are ready all our capabilities especially in the defense the Iron Dome all around the country and also planes are ready,” he said.Islamic Jihad said Ghannam, 62, was also commander-in-chief of the al Quds Brigades and has been wanted for over 20 years, having survived five previous assassination attempts.He had worked in Yasser Arafat’s Fatah and the Popular Resistance Committees, secular Palestinian militant groups that predate the emergence of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the group said.The IDF accused Ghannam of coordinating weapons and money transfers between Islamic Jihad and Hamas, the militant group which runs Gaza. It called him one of the most senior members of Islamic Jihad.Calling the strikes “Operation Shield and Arrow,” the IDF said its fighter jets and helicopters hit 10 Islamic Jihad targets, including what it said were “rocket production workshops in Khan Yunis,” weapon manufacturing sites, military compounds, a concrete manufacturing site and a military post in southern Gaza.Video from Gaza showed explosions lighting up the night sky and the rubble from buildings hit by the strikes.The latest violence came almost a week after Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza exchanged fire following the death of a prominent Palestinian hunger striker in an Israeli prison.Israel conducted strikes on what it said were targets belonging to Hamas as dozens of rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel on May 2.It followed the death of Palestinian detainee Khader Adnan, an Islamic Jihad former spokesman who became a symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli detention policies, in Israeli custody after 87 days of hunger strike.Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen cut short a three-day official visit to India in the wake of the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.He said he had received a security update immediately on landing in New Delhi on Tuesday, when he was due to travel to the city of Agra and then to the financial capital Mumbai on Wednesday, according to an itinerary published by India’s Ministry of External affairs.Gaza is one of the most densely packed places in the world, an isolated coastal enclave of almost two million people crammed into 140 square miles.Governed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the territory is largely cut off from the rest of the world by an Israeli blockade of Gaza’s land, air and sea dating back to 2007. Egypt controls Gaza’s southern border crossing, Rafah.Israel has placed heavy restrictions on the freedom of civilian movement and controls the importation of basic goods into the narrow coastal strip.IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said he did not know if there would be more follow up strikes.“We don’t know yet where we go. It’s still early,” he said. “We’re ready for as long as it takes. The big question is Hamas. What will they decide to do?”",world,0.0

We’ll continue to be here for you.”The 273 wildfires in Alberta so far in 2023 have far exceeded each of the last five years to date as well. With temperatures expected to rise significantly by this weekend and into next week, a provincial state of emergency has been declared as weather conditions threaten to aid in fire growth and worsen the situation.“We are expecting record breaking temperatures across British Columbia and northern Alberta through early next week,” meteorologist Terri Lang from Environment Canada tells CNN. Last week’s abnormally warm and dry conditions have set the stage for more fires this weekend. “This is when we get very aggressive fire behavior,” explained Lang. “Throw in some wind and we are off to the races with regards to the wildfire season.”Temperatures will range between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius above average (18 to 27 degrees Fahrenheit) leading into the weekend, with the peak of the heat expected early next week. Edmonton’s average high temperature is 17°C (62°F) for the month of May, but has already experienced two 30°C (86 °F) days so far this month. The forecast calls for temperatures to exceed 30°C by early next week. “This is very hot for us,” said Lang.Billowing smoke from the over 80 active wildfires across the Alberta province has drifted across Canada and has reached the eastern seaboard of the United States, creating smoky skies across New England. The smoke is so thick that it is visible on satellite imagery, stretching from western Canada to the US East Coast.Forecasts indicate that smoke will continue to drift across Canada throughout the weekend, impacting the quality of air, while a notable shift in winds to the north and west will disperse the smoke toward British Columbia and the Northwest Territories through Saturday.Even though lightning was a factor in the recent uptick of wildfires across Alberta, “many of the wildfires so far this season have been human caused. That could be from anything ranging from sparks created by trains to people being careless where they throw their cigarettes butts,” explained Lang.",world,0.0
361,385,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/americas/canada-expels-chinese-diplomat-intl/index.html,Canadian diplomat expelled from China in tit–for-tat measure,2023-05-09 14:03:00,"China on Tuesday expelled a Canadian diplomat in Shanghai, a day after Canada announced it would expel a Chinese diplomat over allegations he was involved in efforts to intimidate a Canadian politician.In a statement Tuesday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it strongly condemned the expulsion of Toronto-based diplomat Zhao Wei, and as “reciprocal countermeasure,” would declare Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, a consul of the Consulate General of Canada in Shanghai, persona non grata.Lalonde has been asked to leave China before May 13, according to the statement.The tit-for-tat move marks a new low in a years-long deterioration of ties between the two countries and comes amid a period of rising concerns in Canada about Chinese influence, including public uproar over allegations that China attempted to meddle in Canada’s 2019 and 2021 elections.Hours after Beijing announced it would expel Lalonde, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson at a regular briefing threatened that China would “resolutely and forcefully respond” if the Canadian government “keeps acting recklessly” and accused Canadian media and some politicians of “fabricating false information.”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday that Canada would “not be intimidated” by Beijing’s reaction.“We will take whatever action is necessary to continue to protect our democracy and show that we’re standing up for our values and our principles. We understand there is retaliation but we will not be intimidated,” Trudeau said.Canada moved to expel Zhao on Monday, following mounting public pressure on the Canadian government to respond to revelations the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) found an accredited Chinese diplomat in the country had taken efforts toward targeting opposition lawmaker Michael Chong and relatives who may be in China.The alleged targeting took place after Chong sponsored a motion to condemn China’s treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority group. The intelligence was first reported by Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail earlier this month.Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on Monday said Ottawa “will not tolerate any form of foreign interference in our internal affairs. Diplomats in Canada have been warned that if they engage in this type of behaviour, they will be sent home.”Beijing has repeatedly denied accusations of political interference in Canada.The two countries’ relations have already come under significant strain in recent years, in particular following Beijing’s detention of two Canadians in China in move widely seen as retaliation for Canada’s 2018 arrest of a Chinese businesswoman Meng Wanzhou.Beijing repeatedly denied that their cases were political retaliation, but the two men, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, were released on the same day Meng was allowed by Canada to return to China in 2021.There have also been growing public concern about alleged Chinese interference within the country, including through the operation of overseas police stations and policing of speech in the country, which has a large community of people with Chinese heritage.Allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian politics have become a growing challenge for the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who earlier this year initiated an investigation to identify and combat foreign interference in Canada’s elections and its democracy.Trudeau has said intelligence services had failed to brief him about the alleged targeting of Chong. His Foreign Ministry summoned Chinese Ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu last week after the media reporting on the intelligence emerged.Chong, who represents the Wellington-Halton Hills district in Ontario, had called for Zhao’s expulsion and criticized Trudeau’s government for being too slow to act.In a statement posted to Twitter on May 1, Chong said that he found out about the intelligence – which was referenced in a 2021 CSIS report – through the Globe and Mail report, despite having been briefed on general foreign interference threats by CSIS.“Like many Canadians, I have family abroad. The PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) targeting of family abroad to intimidate and coerce Canadians here at home is a serious, national threat,” Chong wrote in the statement, in which he says he has family in Hong Kong.Chong was among several political figures sanctioned by China in March 2021 in what Beijing called a response to American and Canadian sanctions against individuals and entities in its western region of Xinjiang “based on rumors and disinformation.”China has been accused of committing serious human rights violations that may amount to crimes against humanity in its treatment of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in the region. Beijing denies the claims, and rights groups have documented its efforts to quash international focus on the situation there.In February 2021, Canada’s parliament passed its non-binding motion saying China’s treatment of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region constitutes genocide.China has yet to specify what “countermeasures” it may take in response to Zhao’s expulsion, but these could include a tit-for-tat expulsion of a diplomat at Canada’s mission in China.Beijing is also widely seen to have a track record of using economic or trade-related measures to express displeasure with diplomatic partners.The expelled diplomat Zhao was listed in the Department of Global Affairs’ record of foreign diplomats as working in China’s Toronto consulate, the Globe and Mail reported earlier this month.His name was not visible in a CNN search of the directory of China’s foreign representatives Monday night.Prior to naming Zhao as “persona non grata” Monday, Foreign Affairs Minister Joly last week said Canada’s government needed to carefully weigh how China might react to a Canadian response.China would “of course” take action against Canada’s “economic interest, consumer interest and also diplomatic interests,” Joly told parliamentarians on Thursday, adding that, “I know that we are under pressure to go fast, (but) we need to make sure as well that we protect our democracy.”",world,0.0
362,386,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/americas/brazil-david-miranda-died-intl-latam/index.html,"Brazilian politician David Miranda has died at age 37, says husband Glenn Greenwald",2023-05-09 13:59:00,"David Miranda, a Brazilian politician, has died following a nine month battle in intensive care, according to a tweet on Tuesday from his husband, journalist Glenn Greenwald. He was 37 years old.“It is with the most profound sadness that I announce the passing away of my husband @DavidMirandaRio. He would have turned 38 tomorrow. His death, early this morning, came after a 9-month battle in ICU. He died in full peace, surrounded by our children and family and friends,” tweeted Greenwald, who raised two adopted sons with Miranda.Miranda was elected as one of the first openly gay city councilors in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and went on to serve in Brazil’s congress from 2019. Miranda withdrew his candidacy for reelection in September 2022 after six weeks in the ICU suffering from a gastrointestinal infection, according to CNN affiliate CNN Brasil.His death led to an outpouring of tributes online. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called Miranda “a young man with an extraordinary trajectory who left too soon,” on Twitter.“David was singular: the strongest, most passionate, most compassionate man I’ve known,” Greenwald tweeted.“He inspired so many with his biography, passion, and force of life,” he wrote.Miranda’s mother died when he was five years old, according to Greenwald, “leaving him an orphan” in Rio’s poor neighborhood of Jacarezinho.Greenwald has been at the forefront of high-profile reports for exposing secrets in US intelligence programs. With the cooperation of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, Greenwald broke the story of the existence of a US National Security Agency program that is thought to have collected large amounts of phone and Internet data.In 2013, Miranda was detained and interrogated at London’s Heathrow Airport for nine hours by British security forces under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 as he was flying back to Rio from Berlin.While in Berlin, Miranda stayed with filmmaker Laura Poitras, who has worked “extensively” with Greenwald on his stories about the National Security Agency, the reporter wrote at the time.The Guardian newspaper revealed that it paid for Miranda’s flights to Germany. “Miranda is not a Guardian employee but often assists Greenwald in his work,” the newspaper said at the time.  The UK authorities confiscated Miranda’s laptop and thumb drives.According to a profile from TIME magazine, Miranda met Greenwald in 2005 “when he was playing volleyball on Ipanema beach and accidentally knocked over an American tourist’s drink. That tourist was attorney Glenn Greenwald, better known today for his journalism.”The pair “fell in love and moved in together after just five days.”“But by far David’s biggest dream, what gave him the greatest pride and purpose, was being a father. He was the most dedicated and loving parent,” Greenwald wrote on Twitter alongside images of their family.“He taught me how to be a father. And our truly exceptional boys - with their own difficult start to live - is his greatest legacy,” he added.",world,0.0
363,387,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/americas/guns-politics-allen-meanwhile-in-america-intl/index.html,Analysis: Three experts explain America’s gun politics,2023-05-08 23:10:00,"At this point, it’s no surprise that there’s been another mass shooting in America.The latest tragedy came in Allen, Texas, on Saturday when a gunman opened fire on shoppers at an outlet mall. It was another horrific attack on people simply going about their lives, whether at shops, a bank, parties, schools, places of worship or even at their own homes.After every shooting, the political rituals are the same. Republicans who have harnessed their party to activists who want to loosen gun laws offer prayers for the victims and talk vaguely about a mental health crisis. Democrats demand more gun control and a ban on fast-firing assault weapons that can kill multiple people in seconds.But nothing ever changes.Is there any way out of this endless cycle of death? Or is the political system simply too deadlocked — even though majorities of Americans in most polls favor some kind of reform to gun laws.Meanwhile asked three expert contributors from CNN’s “Guns in America” unit about the implications of the latest horror and the state of guns politics in the country.Jennifer Mascia is a senior news writer with “The Trace,” an independent news operation dedicated to covering America’s gun violence epidemic.Meanwhile: Some state officials in pro-gun Texas have argued that since mass shootings also occur in liberal states with tighter gun laws, more restrictions would be not work. Is this true?Mass shootings do occur in states with tight gun laws, as we saw with Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay in California earlier this year. But the states with the loosest gun laws still tend to have higher rates of gun death.According to the most recent CDC figures, the states with the lowest rates of gun death (which includes both homicides and suicides) are Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island; California is 8th. Those states all have gun owner licensing, which means you must get a license or permit before you can even buy a gun. That process typically involves a thorough background check, interviews with law enforcement, character references, mandatory firearm training, and fingerprints. Gun owner licensing, also referred to as permit-to-purchase, is considered the most effective policy at reducing gun deaths.Meanwhile: What are the states with the most deaths from firearms?The states with the highest rates of gun death are Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Alabama, and Wyoming; Texas is 28th. With the exception of New Mexico, all of those states (including Texas) have enacted permitless carry, meaning gun owners are not required to get a license or undergo training in order to carry a concealed gun in public. There are 27 permitless carry states now, and studies have shown that gun violence rises after states loosen concealed carry requirements. A study last year from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that the average rate of gun assaults rose 9.5% in the first decade after 34 states relaxed their concealed carry restrictions. Missouri provides an interesting case study: Until 2007, the state required permits to purchase guns, like Massachusetts, California, and a dozen other states do. In the five years after permit-to-purchase was repealed, the murder rate rose 14%, one study found. Missouri further loosened its gun laws, enacting permitless carry in 2017. In 2019, the Kansas City Star found that the firearm death rate in Missouri had risen 58% since 2007, when the state eliminated permit-to-purchase.Meanwhile: How does the US compare to the rest of the world?Bottom line: In terms of gun violence, you’re safer in California than you are in Texas. But you’re still safer in other countries than you are in California. That’s because, to quote UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, “California has the strictest gun laws in the US but some of the loosest, most permissive gun laws in the industrialized world.” And that explains why California still has mass shootings: Our strongest gun laws are still no match for those in Canada, the UK, Japan, Switzerland, or Israel, among others. Those countries are very careful who they allow to have guns and the screening process lasts many months. The only system that’s comparable is New York City’s gun permitting process, which is overseen by the NYPD.Abené Clayton is the lead reporter for The Guardian’s “Guns and Lies in America” teamMeanwhile: Texas officials seemed to be very loath to offer many specific details about the mass shooting at the shopping mall. What is going on here?I believe that Texas—and most officials who are staunch gun rights and Second Amendment protectors—are working overtime to put distance between guns and the violence that we saw this weekend and continue to see daily. I believe that in addition to wanting to keep their voter base happy, many officials are genuinely afraid of armed resistance from extremists who own guns and are willing to die or create chaos if there is even a hint that there will be limitations put on gun ownership and retention.I also think that the lack of acknowledgment of broader issues of gun violence is meant to maintain the narrative that mass shootings are the result of spiritual warfare or innate evil. Conveniently for officials, neither of these factors can be legislated so it gives them the opportunity to point to a reason for shootings but take no accountability for supporting and creating solutions that will keep people safe.Meanwhile: If local state officials won’t enact measures to stop massacres – or at least try to – what are their obligations for example in doing something meaningful to address mental health problems that they always cite – or to help mitigate the trauma of the victims?There are federal and some state victim assistance programs specifically geared toward people of mass violence and terrorism. (…) I think that state officials need to support, empower, and uplift survivors of mass shootings even though some become politically activated around issues—like red flag laws and assault weapon bans—that may not be palatable for right-leaning legislators’ bases.Politicians like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — both Republicans — and all the local and state officials that refuse to have good faith arguments about gun violence prevention solutions (outside of more police and school hardening) need to at minimum show genuine care to the people who lose loved ones and are irreparably injured following a shooting.Stephen Gutowski founded the “The Reload” — a subscriber publication set up to provide sober, informed reporting on gun ownership in the United States.Meanwhile: Is there any chance that the country’s fractured politics can produce anything to stop this cycle of shootings?There is broad agreement that more needs to be done to prevent mass shootings. The problem is that there’s little agreement between the parties on how to do that. Democrats generally favor broad gun restrictions and bans. Republicans generally favor stricter enforcement of current gun laws and mental health intervention. There is likely some crossover on either point among voters but little among their elected representatives.If these high-profile killings continue to increase, and they are happening at a record pace this year regardless of what count you look at, it could increase pressure for new gun restrictions. That’s what led to last year’s federal gun-control law. But there’s little reason to think it could result in a new national ban on AR-15s or other firearms because there is no support for that among congressional Republicans, and there is unlikely to be even 50 votes for it in the Senate since some Democrats also oppose a ban.Meanwhile: Where is the action to watch on gun policy legislation?State-level policy is becoming increasingly polarized based on the prevailing politics in each state. Red states are focused on reducing attacks by making it easier for law-abiding citizens to obtain and carry guns. Blue states have turned increasingly to bans on “assault weapons” and ammunition magazines that hold a certain amount of ammunition. “Red Flag” laws that allow officials to temporarily seize guns from people determined by a judge to be a threat to themselves or others have mostly caught on in Democratic strongholds.But Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee is attempting to address some of those concerns in a new proposal the Republican-controlled legislature is set to debate in a special session. If they can craft a policy addressing gun rights advocates’ concerns, that could create momentum for the policy in other states. That makes this gun policy debate the most noteworthy at the moment.",politics,0.0

At least 650 people were also detained in the province of Khyber Pakhunkhwa, a government official who requested not to be named, told CNN on Thursday.Police said nearly 1,000 Khan supporters had been arrested in the country’s most populous Punjab province, according to Reuters.Private schools were ordered shut nationwide, with certain countries, including the United States, issuing travel advisories.

Here’s what you need to know,2023-05-11 09:35:00,"Pakistan is teetering after former Prime Minister Imran Khan was dramatically arrested by paramilitary troops on corruption charges, sparking a deadly outpouring of anger against the powerful military that has put the country on edge.Unrest has spread across multiple major cities, resulting in unprecedented scenes of defiant crowds breaking into military properties and setting the homes of army personnel ablaze, directly challenging a usually untouchable force that has long sat at the apex of power in Pakistan.Since it won independence in 1947, Pakistan has struggled with political instability, regime changes and coups with the military having a historically decisive role in who stays in power.The army has accused Khan and his supporters of crossing a red line, saying that military property and installations have been “systematically attacked” and that “anti-army slogans were raised.”“Any further attack on the army, including all law enforcement agencies, military and state installations and properties, will be severely retaliated against,” the military said in a Wednesday statement, its first since Khan’s arrest.“The full responsibility of which will be on the very group that wants to push Pakistan into civil war.”Police said they have arrested six senior politicians from Khan’s party for “inciting arson and violent protests,” adding more arrests should be expected soon.The crisis comes as the nation of 220 million people grapples with an acute economic crisis, as soaring inflation leaves people unable to afford food and fuel, heightening fears about the country’s stability in what is an election year for Pakistan.Khan has consistently stated in interviews that attempts to arrest him are meant to ensure he is out of the running. The government has denied these claims.Here’s what you need to know.Khan was arrested on May 9 by paramilitary troops in a sudden operation that saw officers smash their way into a courthouse in the capital Islamabad to detain him on multiple corruption charges.He is accused of illegally acquiring land to construct a university and has been placed on “physical remand” for eight days, his lawyer told CNN. Khan has also been charged in a separate case for unlawfully selling gifts sent to him by foreign leaders while in office.In a pre-recorded statement released on YouTube by the PTI after his arrest, the former prime minister said he was “detained on incorrect charges” and told his supporters “the time has come for all of you to come and struggle for your rights.”On Thursday, Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled Khan’s arrest was unlawful, overturning a lower court’s ruling on Tuesday that it was legal. The court ordered that Khan be released, according to officials in Khan’s political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).Khan’s arrest turbocharged what was already a tense showdown between the military and Khan’s supporters that had been simmering for months.The largest protests took place in the cities of Lahore and Peshawar, both political strongholds for Khan, and saw crowds clash with security forces.Hundreds of protesters stormed the headquarters of the national broadcaster Radio Pakistan in Peshawar, setting the building on fire.At least eight people have died in the clashes and more than 300 been injured, according to officials. More than 650 people have been detained in the province of Khyber Pakhunkhwa, a government official who requested not to be named, told CNN on Thursday.Police said nearly 1,000 Khan supporters had been arrested in the country’s most populous Punjab province, according to Reuters.Private schools were ordered shut nationwide, with certain countries, including the United States, issuing travel advisories. The government blocked mobile internet services in a bid to quell the chaos, disrupting access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Popular apps and digital payment systems have also been disrupted.Authorities in three of the country’s four provinces have imposed an emergency order banning all gatherings. The military has been called into Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to provide security assistance.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called Khan’s supporters “terrorists” and has told them to “behave or face punishment.”Arguably Pakistan’s best-known prime minister in recent decades, Khan has made a name for himself as a politician, philanthropist and sports superstar both at home and around the world.Born in 1952 in the city of Lahore, he received a prestigious education, rounded off with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics from Oxford University. He went on to become one of the best cricket players of his generation, ushering the Pakistan team to World Cup victory in 1992.Riled by the constant state of corruption in a country historically led by powerful dynasties, his eyes were set on politics, and he founded his own political party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), in 1996.The party mostly languished in the political wilderness until 2013, with a crop of new voters attracted by Khan’s promise to put an end to corruption and economic troubles. The PTI roared ahead in that year’s general election – though they were unable to win a majority.In 2018, backed by the military, Khan was voted prime minister, promising a “new Pakistan,” vowing to eradicate poverty and corruption.His unique brand of Islamic populism won him support from a young population in a country where anti-American sentiment and anti-establishment feelings are common.But his relationship with the generals soured and things took a turn last year when Khan was removed from power in a vote of no confidence over claims of economic mismanagement.The ouster riled his supporters, sparking mass protests, as Khan increasingly spoke out publicly against the military’s role in politics.Last November, Khan survived a shooting at a political rally, in what his party called an assassination attempt.Acting on the corruption charges, police and paramilitary troops had attempted to arrest Khan multiple times in recent months – with one operation this March ending in chaos as his supporters challenged authorities outside his home.And the political upheaval appears to have only bolstered Khan’s popularity. Last year, his PTI party won local elections in the country’s most populous Punjab province, seen as a litmus test for national elections.Since Khan’s ouster, tens of thousands of his supporters have taken to the streets in key cities across Pakistan to protest, chanting slogans against Pakistan’s military.Regarded as a formidable force in the country, the military has intervened in Pakistan’s politics multiple times in history, at times running the country directly.And while political leaders have sometimes challenged its dominance in the past, analysts say the current situation is different because of who Khan’s supporters are.It is “unique” that Khan has “garnered significant public support from the urban middle class, a group that has not traditionally been involved in challenging the military’s role in politics,” said Syed Baqir Sajjad, a Pakistan Fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington.“This has put increased pressure on the military establishment, which is feeling the heat more this time,” he said.Khan has repeatedly accused the military of conspiring with Sharif to remove him from office, even calling out a senior official by name and accusing him of being behind the shooting that injured him in November.Going on Khan’s claims, his supporters have targeted their rage toward the military, fervently taking to social media to put out messages against the establishment.“The intensity and consistency of Imran Khan’s attacks on the military, especially after being ousted from office last year, are unprecedented,” said Sajjad.“It remains to be seen how this conflict will play out in the long term, but it is clear that the relationship between the military and civilian government in Pakistan has always been a fragile one, with power struggles frequently erupting into open conflict.”The situation on the ground remains tense with Khan in custody and no clear off-ramp to the crisis for now.All of this, Sajjad said, puts Pakistan in a precarious place and raises concerns about “the country’s stability.”“The chance of the military establishment getting (a state of) emergency imposed in the country and keeping former Prime Minister Imran Khan behind bars for a prolonged time is fairly high, because none of the political actors are strong enough to pose a serious challenge to Khan’s PTI in polls,” he said.“No situation is expected that would drastically alter the ground situation in favor of the incumbent government. Meanwhile, the army cannot afford Khan’s return to power.”However, he adds it is “crucial to note” that such a move would have “severe consequences” for the country’s democratic institutions.“The imposition of a state of emergency would likely result in the suspension of civil liberties, the suppression of political dissent, and the curtailing of press freedom,” he said. “This, in turn, could lead to further unrest and instability, making it harder for Pakistan to attract foreign investment and maintain its economic growth.”",world,0.0

They were heading to the shops to buy a new toy car.Langkawi police chief Shariman Ashari said the car they were driving, a silver Toyota Vios, had attracted the attention of other drivers who gave chase because they assumed the driver had been “drunk.”He said the boys had sneaked out of their home while their “mother was in the bathroom and father was asleep” and taken the vehicle. They had traveled about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) before the crash, which damaged the car’s bonnet, Shariman added.“The driver was a minor aged six, who was driving a passenger – his brother, aged three. The crash occurred when the car, traveling from Ulu Melaka towards Kampung Nyior Chabang, lost control and crashed into a lamppost near Kampung Titi Chanwang,” Shariman said.A 95-second video clip that has gone viral on Facebook appears to show the boys sitting on the driver’s seat, wearing casual shirts and red pants.They can be heard telling passersby that they want to go to a toy store to buy a model car. “Mama is at home and we are going to the store,” the elder boy says in Malay. “We want to buy a black car,” the younger one adds.Police said the elder boy suffered a cut to his chin while his brother was not injured. They have not named either child.They said the case is being investigated under Section 43 of the Road Transport Act 1987 for reckless driving.",travel,0.0
367,391,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/asia/pakistan-imran-khan-arrest-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html,Pakistan on edge as ex-PM Imran Khan charged with corruption,2023-05-10 14:22:00,"Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has appeared in court to answer corruption charges, a day after he was dramatically arrested by paramilitary troops, sparking nationwide clashes.The charge relates to the sale of gifts sent to him by foreign leaders while in office. His lawyer told CNN Khan rejects the indictment.Khan has alleged he was “tortured and beaten all night” while in detention, his lawyer told CNN, adding that the former leader had “bruises on his head” when he met him at the court hearing.Khan was arrested on Tuesday in another corruption case, where he is accused of the illegal acquisition of land and construction for a university.His lawyer told CNN that Khan has been placed on “physical remand” for eight days following the court hearing, for the charge brought on Tuesday.His arrest has turbocharged an already tense showdown between the country’s powerful military and his supporters, who hit the streets and sparked unprecedented scenes as angry crowds broke into and vandalized the homes of army personnel.Pakistan’s military described the protests that followed Khan’s arrest a “dark chapter” in the country’s history, warning that any further attacks “on the army, including all law enforcement agencies, military and state installations and properties, will be severely retaliated against,” in a statement Wednesday.Three of Khan’s supporters died in clashes in the city of Peshawar and nearly 30 others were injured, a hospital spokesperson said. Clashes continued Wednesday with hundreds of Khan’s supporters storming the headquarters of the national broadcaster Radio Pakistan in Peshawar, according to a CNN journalist at the scene.Photos from Peshawar’s streets showed security forces firing teargas at crowds, some of whom used slingshots.Police said nearly 1,000 Khan supporters had been arrested in Punjab province after 25 police vehicles and more than 14 government buildings were set on fire, Reuters reported.Authorities in three of Pakistan’s four provinces have also imposed an emergency order banning all gatherings, Reuters added.Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s minister for planning and development, told reporters on Wednesday that Khan had “chosen a path of spreading anarchy, chaos and destruction” to “protect himself from accountability.”“I want to assure there is no political vendetta,” he added.Wednesday’s hearing took place in the police station rather than a court to “keep him away from the public”, police said.Video before Khan’s arrest on Tuesday showed paramilitary forces breaking a window to get to the politician as he watched impassively at the unfolding chaos. Khan was then led into a vehicle surrounded by dozens of security officers and escorted away.In a pre-recorded statement released on YouTube by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party after his arrest, the former prime minister said he was “detained on incorrect charges” and told his supporters “the time has come for all of you to come and struggle for your rights.”“I have always followed the law. I am being apprehended so that I can’t follow my political path for this country’s fundamental rights and for me to obey this corrupt government of crooks which has been hoisted on us,” he said in the video.Violent protests broke out in several cities that afternoon.Khan supporters armed with sticks broke into the military’s headquarters in the city of Rawalpindi, just outside the capital, chanting in support of the former leader.Protesters also blocked one of the main thoroughfares into Islamabad, throwing stones and pulling down street signs. A police vehicle was set ablaze, resulting in police retaliating with tear gas.Meanwhile, in the southwestern city of Quetta, a Khan supporter was shot and killed by police at a protest, according to a CNN journalist at the scene.Authorities blocked mobile internet services shortly after in a bid to quell the chaos, disrupting access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in the nation of 270 million. Private schools across the country were ordered shut on Wednesday, according to the Private Schools Association.At least 43 protesters were arrested in Islamabad Tuesday, the city’s police said on Twitter.Syed Baqir Sajjad, a Pakistan Fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said that although previous Pakistani leaders had faced arrest, and politicians had in the past challenged the military’s dominance, Khan’s significant public support made this situation “unique.”“The risks faced by Pakistan in this situation are numerous,” he said. “The military’s image as a unifying force and the guardian of the state has been seriously challenged, which has led to a loss of public trust in the institution. This, in turn, could lead to instability and social unrest.”Khan was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last year and has since led a popular campaign against the current government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accusing it of colluding with the military to remove him from office.The former star cricketer turned populist politician denies the charges leveled against him, instead accusing Sharif and the military of playing a political game. The military and Sharif – who was recently in the United Kingdom after attending the coronation of the British monarch – deny Khan’s accusations.The tensions have brought Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country of some 220 million people that has for decades grappled with political instability, into unknown territory and have often boiled over into violence.Last November, Khan survived a shooting at a political rally, in what his party called an assassination attempt.And in March, chaos erupted outside Khan’s Lahore home after hundreds of his supporters challenged police and paramilitary troops who had arrived to escort him away. Officers were forced to suspend the operation after protests turned violent – one of multiple unsuccessful attempts by police to arrest Khan.Khan’s claims have struck a chord with a young population in a country where anti-establishment feelings are common, and are being fueled by a rising cost of living crisis as soaring inflation makes ordinary goods increasingly unaffordable.“This has put increased pressure on the military establishment, which is feeling the heat more this time,” said Sajjad. “The intensity and consistency of Imran Khan’s attacks on the military, especially after being ousted from office last year, are unprecedented.”Amid the crisis, the government has so far failed to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to restart a $6.5 billion loan program that has stalled since November, in an effort to keep the economy afloat.The political upheaval appears to have bolstered Khan’s popularity. Last year, his PTI party won local elections in the country’s most populous Punjab province, seen as a litmus test for national elections.The political polarization and economic crisis had placed Pakistan at “a critical juncture,” and the situation had the “potential to become a permanent crisis,” Sajjad said.Pakistan’s future trajectory “will largely depend on how its leaders navigate the ongoing crises and whether they can find a way to address the people’s grievances and restore stability,” he added.",world,0.0
368,392,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/most-beautiful-castles-world/index.html,World’s most beautiful castles,2023-05-11 22:25:00,"What is it about castles that fascinates so many people around the globe?A lot of the allure derives from the history and human drama that played out within the walls, as well as the astonishing architecture that features on so many castles. But they’re also romantic and somewhat mystical, places that spark our imagination and conjure visions of long-ago knights in shining armor and powerful warrior queens.“Because they combine two functions, they are far more interesting than fortresses or palaces,” says Marc Morris, author of “Castles: Their History and Evolution in Medieval Britain.”“What makes a castle a castle is that it combines the functions of defense and dwelling – it’s a fortification and a stately home rolled into one. Creating a building which is both comfortable and defensible is difficult. The ingenious ways in which castle-designers reconciled this balance is always intriguing.”Although we normally associate castles with European history, it’s actually an architectural form found around the world – in nations as varied as Japan and India, Morocco and Mexico.Many are now hubs of living history where modern visitors can watch jousting and other ancient combat forms, listen to medieval music or watch artisans demonstrate the arts, crafts and everyday skills of a thousand years ago.They also make great backdrops for outdoor concerts, films, theater and military performances, or for the on-location filming of movies and television shows.“With a castle you get not only the stories of sieges, but also stories of the domestic lives of the rich and famous,” says Morris. “Castles are places were plots were hatched, marriages were consummated, murders carried out, royal babies born, and so on. With castles, you are never short of fascinating things to talk about.”Read on to find out more about 21 of the world’s most beautiful castles, fortified homes that are both a feast for the eyes and a time trip back to the bygone age during which they were created.Located about 30 minutes by bullet train west of Osaka and Kobe, Himeji rises above the Inland Sea and is considered the epitome of the Japanese feudal castle.Both a Japanese national treasure and World Heritage Site, the elegant whitewashed structure is also called “White Heron Castle” because of its resemblance to a great bird taking flight.Completed in the early 17th century, Himeji offers daily guided tours in Japanese and English.This classic medieval castle towers above the island of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea. Originally built as a Byzantine citadel, it was reworked into its present Gothic form by the crusading Knights of St John when Rhodes served as the headquarters of their grand master.During the brief Italian occupation of the Dodecanese Islands, Benito Mussolini used the castle as a holiday home. Its permanent archeological exhibitions feature relics from ancient Greece and the early Christian period.Even though many people consider this Bavarian masterpiece the epitome of a German castle, it’s a relatively new creation, erected in the late 1800s at the behest of King Ludwig II.The Bavarian monarch instructed his architects to design something that would reflect both the operas of Richard Wagner and the romantic ideals of the Middle Ages – as much a fantasy as Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland, but with the snowcapped Alps as a backdrop and the Bavarian plains spread out beneath.Neuschwanstein is also a cinema darling, having appeared in numerous flicks over the years including “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” and “The Great Escape.”One of the most striking castles in all of Europe, the Alcázar rides a narrow, rocky promontory overlooking the plains of Old Castile in central Spain.Although it started life as a Roman fort, the structure evolved over hundreds of years into a prototypical medieval castle with a deep moat, drawbridge, round guard towers and a robust keep, as well as lavishly decorated royal chambers.Segovia Castle is most renowned as the home of Queen Isabella and powerful Phillip II before the royal court was moved to Madrid.Another offspring of the Romantic movement that swept 19th-century Europe, Pena crowns a hilltop near Sintra, Portugal.Commissioned by King Ferdinand II on the site of a ruined monastery dedicated to the Virgin of Pena, the castle is a flamboyant blend of various historic styles including Gothic, Moorish and Renaissance details.The castle’s vivid red-and-yellow color pattern – and its flashy clock tower – endow Pena with a much more playful air than the somber castles found elsewhere in Europe.Erected in the early 17th century by the Mughal ruler of Rajasthan, the Amber Fortress crowns a hilltop near Jaipur, its stout walls reflected in the waters of Maota Lake.The palace complex inside the walls revolves around courtyards flanked by exquisite examples of Rajput architecture like the Maharaja’s Apartments, Sukh Niwas (Hall of Pleasure) and Diwan-i-Am (Royal Audience Hall).Although it was once fashionable to ride an elephant up the steep entrance road, visitors are now advised to walk or take a 4x4 taxi.This massive mudbrick structure on the edge of the Sahara has starred in more than a dozen movies and television shows including “Game of Thrones,” “Gladiator” and “The Man Who Would Be King.”The complex features a fortified lower town along the Asif Ounila River – where people still reside – and a partially ruined hilltop citadel.Berber-style guest houses provide accommodation for visitors to a ksar originally built in the 17th century as an overnight stop for caravans traveling between Marrakech and the Sudan.Founded in the waning years of the Viking Age, Kalmar Castle traces its roots to a 12th-century defensive tower overlooking the Kalmar Strait on the Baltic Sea.Four centuries later, King Gustav and his sons transformed Kalmar into a splendid royal residence that (with the help of renovation) looks much the same today as it did in 1592.In addition to exhibitions, children’s activities and guided tours, Scandinavia’s best-preserved Renaissance castle also features special events like the Van Gogh multimedia show, which is open until November 2019.Guarding the entrance to San Juan Bay, this 16th-century Spanish citadel is one of the most impressive structures in the Caribbean.Protected by a moat (with a drawbridge), stone battlements and rugged sea cliffs, the castle has repelled numerous attacks including several assaults by French pirates and a 1595 strike by Sir Francis Drake.  However, it surrendered to US forces after a fierce naval bombardment during the Spanish-American War.Since 1962, El Morro and nearby Castillo San Cristóbal (the largest fort constructed by the Spanish in the western hemisphere) have been part of the San Juan National Historic Site. The grassy “field of fire” in front of the castle is now immensely popular for picnics and kite flying.Although it’s officially called a palace, Istanbul’s sprawling Topkapi compound bears all the features of a classic castle: defensible site, fortified walls, powerful gateways and a royal residence occupied by the Ottoman sultans from the late 15th century when it was originally constructed until the 1850s.Converted into a museum when the Ottoman Empire dissolved after World War I, the Topkapi offers extensive gardens, wall-top walks overlooking the Bosphorus, the Ottoman Imperial Harem where the ruler’s concubines resided and the Imperial Treasury with its famous emerald-encrusted golden dagger – stolen and eventually retrieved in the 1964 heist movie “Topkapi.”Perched on an ancient volcanic outcrop at the end of the Royal Mile, Edinburgh Castle is considered the “most besieged place” in Britain with at least 26 major attacks during its 1,100-year lifespan.From Mary Queen of Scots to Oliver Cromwell and Sir Walter Raleigh, many famous Britons are indelibly linked the ancient edifice.Britain’s oldest crown jewels (the Honours of Scotland) are safeguarded inside a castle that also provides an incredibly fitting venue for the annual Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.Music concerts, living history events and weapons demonstrations are among the many events staged throughout the year inside the walls. And bygone military mascots are buried in the castle’s Dog Cemetery.Despite its diminutive size, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is well-endowed with castles – more than 50 are spread across an area smaller than London’s metro area. The most spectacular of these is Schloss Vianden, poised high above the Our River in northern Luxembourg.Built on the site of an ancient Roman fortress that protected the empire from barbarian invasion, the castle was constructed between the 11th and 14th centuries.Blending aspects of Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance design, it remained in royal hands until 1977 when the Grand Duke bequeathed it to the state. Vianden’s biggest annual bash is an August medieval festival with dueling knights, troubadours, jugglers and artisans.The Kremlin in Moscow may be better known, but it can’t hold a candle to the one in Novgorod when it comes to medieval ambiance.Located 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of St. Petersburg, Novgorod was the seat of a powerful Russian republic from the 11th to 15th century when it was finally overshadowed by Moscow.That power was concentrated inside the detinets or kremlin with its sturdy walls and heavily fortified towers.Among its landmarks today are the Cathedral of the Holy Wisdom with its silver domes, the Novgorod Museum and the Millennium of Russia monument.There’s no better example of the transition from the fortified castles of the medieval era to palatial homes of the Renaissance than this enormous chateau in the Loire Valley.Commissioned as a “hunting lodge” by King François I in the early 16th century, the massive structure (440 rooms) took 28 years to construct.However, the moat, corner towers and keep are purely decorative. Chambord is celebrating its 500th anniversary this year with myriad special events including an exhibition that addresses the question of whether Leonardo da Vinci designed the castle’s double helix staircase.One of the finest examples of Chinese castle architecture is Shuri, a hilltop fortress and palace complex on the island of Okinawa in Japan.As the royal court of the independent Ryukyu Kingdom for more than 450 years – when the islands were heavily influenced by nearby China – Shuri developed a warren of imperial living quarters, audience halls, religious shrines and an extravagant throne room reminiscent of the Forbidden City in Beijing.The compound was heavily restored after World War II, when Shuri served as the local headquarters for the Imperial Japanese Army. The castle’s present-day activities range from a morning gate-opening ritual called Ukejo and multilingual audio tours of the grounds to daily dance performances and nighttime illumination.England has far larger castles (Windsor) and others that are more steeped in history (Tower of London). But none boasts that textbook form of Bodiam Castle in East Sussex.Erected in 1385 as the bastion of a former royal knight, it’s the epitome of a medieval castle – thick crenelated walls supported by nine stubby towers, arrayed around a square central courtyard and reached via a wooden walkway (a drawbridge in olden days) across a wide moat.Among its many visitor summer activities are archery sessions, dressing up in medieval costumes, afternoon tea with cakes and scones and guided tours. And just seven miles away is where the landmark Battle of Hastings played out in 1066.The only royal castle in the Western hemisphere hovers high above Mexico City.Erected in the late 1700s as a summer house for the viceroy of New Spain, the castle has played many roles since then, including the palace of Emperor Maximillian and an 1847 battle between Mexican troops and invading Americans that features in the “Marine Corps Hymn” (“From the Halls of Montezuma …”).Nowadays Chapultepec is home to Mexico’s National Museum of History. The royal quarters – including the precious Malachite Room and Maximillian’s flamboyant bedroom – are included in castle tours.What makes this Slovenian castle so special is its astounding location – Predjama is arrayed across a cave mouth beneath a natural rock arch on the side of a sheer cliff.The lofty setting made it virtually impregnable when it was constructed in the 13th century. Attackers laid siege to Predjama on numerous occasions, but a secret passageway (that still exists today) allowed the defenders to come and go at will.Located 62 kilometers (38 miles) from Ljubljana, the castle and its park-like grounds host the Erasmus Knight’s Tournament, a medieval festival and jousting competition staged every July.This island bastion overlooking the Bay of Naples is the oldest castle on our list, tracing its roots to the 5th century BC when Greeks colonized the region. From Roman legionnaires to Napoleon’s troops, many armies have occupied Aragonese over the years.The castle now belongs to the family of an Italian lawyer who purchased the fortified island in 1912 and began restoration of its battlements, churches, convents, crypts and gardens. In addition to views that stretch all the way across the bay to Mt. Vesuvius, Aragonese Castle boasts outdoor cafes, a bookshop, art exhibits and outdoor movies.Prague’s imposing citadel is also one of the few castles anywhere in the world that still boasts real political power – the official residence of the president of the Czech Republic.Among the other landmarks inside its spacious confines are St Vitus Cathedral, the Old Royal Palace, 10 gardens and a row of 16th-century cottages called the Golden Lane that once housed the castle guards.Guided tours, offered during daylight and evening hours, last around three hours.Although it’s virtually impossible to visit these days, owing to the ongoing conflict in Syria, Krak des Chevaliers remains one of the world’s great castles – and the only one on our list that has experienced (and fortunately survived) 21st-century warfare.Created in the 12th century by the Knights of St. John, the celebrated Krak is considered the epitome of a crusader castle in the Middle East and one of the greatest statements of medieval military architecture.The structure features two mighty walls separated by a moat on a steep hillside between Homs and the Mediterranean Sea. The latest UNESCO report on the castle (2019) states that restoration and archeological work has commenced again, but the security situation remains tenuous.",travel,0.0

But it’s no secret that ski vacations can be costly. Fortunately, there’s one way to truly keep the cost down: using your travel rewards to cover the cost of your hotelPlenty of chain hotels offer properties in the middle of ski towns, so there’s often no shortage of lodging opportunities. And even though many of these properties charge exorbitant rates during the winter vacation ski season, you’ll find that using your points can be a great deal.Before you go ahead and book your next ski vacation, take a look to see if any travel rewards hotels are located in your desired destination. We’ve taken a look at the most popular Marriott Bonvoy, World of Hyatt and Hilton Honors properties where you can use your points to save big when hitting the slopes.Of the three major hotel chains in the US, Marriott has the largest number of properties catered toward ski vacations. So, if you want to have access to as many mountain properties as possible, accruing Marriott Bonvoy points is the way to go. The chain has a slew of properties in Colorado, but you’ll find that you can also redeem your points in Utah, California, Canada, Switzerland and beyond.With Marriott Bonvoy’s dynamic pricing model, the number of points required for a free night is loosely tied to the cash rate. This also means that if you’re able to vacation during the shoulder season — before Christmas and at the end of March — you’ll often find that far fewer points are required for a free night.Before diving into the ways to spend your points, you have to earn them. One of the easiest and fastest ways to earn Marriott Bonvoy points is to sign up for one of the chain’s Marriott-branded credit cards. Marriott credit cards offer a wide range of benefits, and with many, you can easily offset the annual fee.

The hotel also features two onsite restaurants and a bar. And when you’re ready to hang up your skis for the day, enjoy a visit to the spa or steam room.Points required: From 90,000 to 120,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.Located right in the middle of all the fun in Aspen, this relatively new property is just a short walk to the slopes. With a more lively vibe than The St. Regis just down the street, you’ll have access to a rooftop pool, hot tub, fire pit and bar.

Just strap on your skis or snowboard and you can be on the slopes in no time. And if you’re new to skiing, the gondola right outside of the hotel will take you to the base of the mountain where you can meet your ski school group. Although the hotel is approximately 20 minutes away from Aspen, newbies will prefer the more beginner and intermediate terrain of Snowmass. The resort might not be as fancy as some other hotels in the vicinity, but it still offers a heated pool, hot tub and fitness center.Points required: From 49,000 to 63,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.After a $40 million renovation and a name change, this upscale resort is an ideal destination for your next ski vacation. Although The Hythe Vail is not a true ski-in/ski-out property, the hotel is just a quick walk to nearby lifts, restaurants, shops and an outdoor ice-skating rink. And after a long day of skiing, families will love the hot chocolate bar and complimentary s’mores.When using points, you have the option of a king bed or two double beds. To book yourself into a room with two queen beds — an admittedly more comfortable sleeping situation — you’ll have to pay an upgrade fee or redeem additional points. Alternatively, larger suites are also available for an additional fee.Points required: From 79,000 to 106,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.This massive resort is at the base of the Bachelor Gulch side of the mountain, giving you a relaxing ski-in/ski-out experience.

At the property, you’ll have access to three onsite restaurants plus a bar, lounge, outdoor heated pool, fitness center and ski valet.Points required: From 84,000 to 120,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.With ski school located right outside the front door, a stay at the Beaver Creek Lodge is the perfect destination for families. This ski-in/ski-out property is located right in Beaver Creek Village, where you’re just a stone’s throw away from many shops, restaurants and an outdoor ice-skating rink. At the end of the day, you can relax at the hotel’s fire pit or take a swim in the outdoor heated pool.Best of all, all rooms are suites. This means that when using points, you’ll be able to score a larger hotel room outfitted with a fireplace and kitchenette. Or if you’re traveling with a large family, you can book a two-bedroom family suite — though be prepared to spend additional points.Points required: From 73,000 to 106,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.If you’re looking for a skier’s paradise, look no further than The St. Regis Deer Valley. This slopeside property is right off one of the trails at Deer Valley and about a 10-minute shuttle drive to the base of the mountain.With a ski valet, rental shop, 14,000-square-foot spa, a multi-level pool complex and two hot tubs, there are endless opportunities to be pampered.

The heated outdoor saltwater pool area is in its own private oasis, offering the perfect après ski experience.Points required: From 52,000 to 74,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.Across the pond in the Swiss Alps, you’ll find the W Verbier — a ski-in/ski-out property in the Les 4 Vallées ski area. At 5,220 meters in elevation, you’ll have access to about 250 miles of ski terrain. And with plush blankets and a fireplace in every hotel room, you’ll be able to stay nice and cozy, despite the cold weather outside. The hotel features five onsite restaurants and bars, two heated pools (indoor and outdoor) and a luxurious spa with nine treatment rooms.Points required: From 82,000 to 120,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night during winter.Hyatt has a good number of hotels for those eager to hit the slopes using their points — especially if you’re looking for something other than the typical West Coast mountains. With a strong loyalty program in World of Hyatt, you’ll actually find yourself redeeming fewer points than the likes of Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors.World of Hyatt offers a three-tier award chart: off-peak, standard and peak. While you’ll probably find most of the ski season to be at the standard or peak level, the number of points required has a set price. This means that even during the most expensive dates of the season, as long as a standard guest room is available, the number of points required will be fixed. And, when redeeming your Hyatt points, you will not be charged resort fees.Earning World of Hyatt points is incredibly easy. For starters, there are two Hyatt-branded credit cards: the World of Hyatt Credit Card and the World of Hyatt Business Credit Card. With the sign-up bonus on the World of Hyatt Card, you can earn up to 60,000 points — you’ll get 30,000 points after spending $3,000 in the first three months plus up to 30,000 additional points by earning double points per dollar spent in the first six months from account opening. Additionally, this credit card comes with a free night certificate to be used at a Category 1-4 property every year on your card member anniversary.If you have a credit card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card or Chase Sapphire Reserve®, those points transfer to World of Hyatt at a one-to-one ratio.If you have kids in ski school, you can’t beat the location of the Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort and Spa. At the bottom of the slopes and a short walk away from Beaver Creek village, you’ll never have to get in a car at this ski-in/ski-out resort. Right outside of the hotel, you’ll find a spacious outdoor fire pit, perfect for s’mores making or taking in the scenery. You’ll also have access to a heated outdoor pool and five hot tubs — with views of the mountain, of course.And since you’re just a short stroll away from the village, you can easily explore many restaurants, bars, shops and an outdoor ice-skating rink.Points required: A Category 7 property, requiring 25,000 to 35,000 World of Hyatt points per night.With its own chair lift right outside the front door, getting on the slopes is easier than ever at the Grand Hyatt Vail. After a long day of skiing, you can relax in the outdoor heated infinity pool and two hot tubs. With the resort shuttle, you can easily get around the area, including easy access to Vail village and the nearby Vail Square Ice Rink.The hotel also features many onsite activities, such as Topgolf, axe throwing and a s’mores roast. And with many other non-skiing winter activities nearby, there’s plenty to keep you busy during your next ski trip.Points required: A Category 6 property, requiring 21,000 to 29,000 World of Hyatt points per night.Although not as lavish as some of the other properties mentioned on this list, the Hyatt Place Keystone offers one of the best values when using points. One of the best parts of this resort is that Keystone offers free skiing for kids 12 and under with a two-night stay. This is an unbelievable value and can truly make an incredibly expensive ski vacation that much more affordable.Keystone also offers night skiing over the weekends and holidays. And like most other Hyatt Place properties, your entire family can enjoy a complimentary breakfast every morning. The property is a shuttle bus away from the mountain, although you could also walk 1/3-mile journey.Points required: A Category 4 property, requiring 12,000 to 18,000 World of Hyatt points per night, or use a Category 1-4 free night certificate earned from the World of Hyatt Credit Card.Using your hard-earned hotel points for some East Coast skiing can be challenging, as there aren’t as many properties. The Lodge at Spruce Peak is the only hotel option at the base of Mount Mansfield. Located right in Spruce Peak village, you have easy access to restaurants, shops, an ice-skating rink and an indoor rock-climbing facility. The resort also features a heated outdoor pool and multiple hot tubs.And if you score an upgrade, you’ll be incredibly impressed with the hotel’s one-, two- and three-bedroom suites. One thing to know, however, is that when booking a stay at this property, a three- or four-night minimum is often required during peak ski season.Points required: A Category 7 property, requiring 25,000 to 35,000 World of Hyatt points per night.Located at the base of Palisades Tahoe, this 405-room property has everything you’re looking for in a ski vacation. Although the Resort at Squaw Creek is a few miles from the village, the property offers many dining options, a ski valet, spa, multiple heated outdoor swimming pools and even a 90-foot water slide.But best of all, even during peak ski season, some nights fall under the “off-peak” category within the World of Hyatt award chart. This will allow you to save your points or potentially extend your ski vacation even longer. And if you’re lucky enough to be upgraded during your stay, many rooms offer a kitchenette or a full kitchen.Points required: A Category 6 property, requiring From 21,000 to 29,000 World of Hyatt points per night.Although Hilton doesn’t offer as many ski-catered properties as Marriott and Hyatt, there are still some great options when using your Hilton Honors points for your next mountain vacation.Similar to Marriott, you’ll receive your fifth night free when redeeming points, but with one caveat: You must have Hilton Honors Silver, Gold or Diamond elite status. Fortunately, all four Hilton Honors-branded credit cards offer some form of elite status automatically as a benefit. Even the no-annual-fee Hilton Honors American Express Card comes with automatic Silver elite status, enabling you to easily score a free night on a five-night stay (see rates and fees).Hilton also got rid of its award chart a few years ago, which means that the number of points required is somewhat tied to the cash price. However, when using points for a free night stay, all resort fees are waived. This is a great incentive to use your Hilton points, especially at a resort property.Similar to many other chain loyalty programs, credit card bonus offers are one of the easiest ways to earn a mass of points at once. Right now, the Hilton Amex offers a welcome bonus of 70,000 Hilton points plus a Free Night Reward, which you’ll earn after spending $1,000 in the first three months. Alternatively, the Hilton Honors American Express Business Card has an offer where you’ll earn 150,000 bonus points plus a Free Night Reward after you spend $4,000 in the first three months (offer ends July 19, 2023).The Hilton Amex comes with automatic Silver elite status, while the Business Hilton Amex comes with automatic Gold elite status, one of the best mid-tier hotel status levels. With Gold elite status, you’ll receive complimentary breakfast, space-available upgrades and late checkout at participating Hilton properties.You can also transfer points at a one-to-two ratio from American Express Membership Rewards. This means that if you have the American Express® Gold Card or The Platinum Card® from American Express, you can transfer your Amex points to your Hilton Honors account to help you book a great ski vacation.The Waldorf Astoria Park City is one of the most luxurious ski resorts you’ll find — one where you can easily sit by the fire and drink hot chocolate or roast s’mores after a day of skiing. Guest rooms range from studios to a four-bedroom suite, with all rooms featuring a gas fireplace.The hotel offers an outdoor heated pool with an extremely large hot tub. There’s also a shuttle that will take you downtown or to Park City Mountain or Deer Valley. And for those renting a car, valet parking is included in the resort fee — which is waived when using Hilton Honors points.One thing to keep in mind is that while the property is considered ski-in/ski-out, you still need to walk across a parking lot and take the gondola to the base of the mountain. From there, you’ll have access to the Canyons side of the mountain, with opportunities to make your way over to Park City.Points required: From 95,000 Hilton Honors points per night during winter.Another incredible option for those looking to ski in Canada is the Hilton Whistler. Located right in the center of Whistler Village, you’re less than a five-minute walk to either the Whistler Mountain or Blackcomb Mountain gondola, giving you access to more than 8,000 acres of terrain.This full-service ski resort also offers an outdoor heated pool as well as indoor and outdoor whirlpools. And while the village offers plenty of restaurant options, if you prefer to not leave the hotel, there’s a restaurant and bar onsitePoints required: From 62,000 to 80,000 Hilton Honor points per night during winter.Check out CNN Underscored’s guide to the best credit cards currently available.﻿",business,0.0
370,394,https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/travel/hilton-amex-free-night-reward-certificate,The 10 best Hilton hotels where you can redeem your free night reward certificate,2023-05-11 14:36:00,"One of the best ways to save money — and travel rewards — on future travel is with free night reward certificates. Many hotel loyalty programs offer them — including Marriott Bonvoy and World of Hyatt — but when it comes to saving you the most amount of money, Hilton Honors comes out on top.That’s because with Hilton Honors free night reward certificates, there’s no cap on how much the room can cost. As long as a standard room is available to be booked with points, the certificate can be applied (with very few exceptions). Many other hotel programs only allow you to use certificates at properties costing up to a certain number of points, but not Hilton. With standard rooms costing up to 95,000 Hilton Honors points per night, these free night reward certificates can offer huge savings.To receive maximum value from these free night rewards, the best strategy is to use them at a high-end hotel. Since there’s no dollar or point value restriction, this means you’ll ideally want to use these certificates when the nightly rate costs in points or cash is incredibly high. But, at the end of the day, free is free, so the best use is also somewhere that will allow you to enjoy yourself on that much-needed vacation — for free.As an ongoing benefit, many Hilton credit cards give you the opportunity to earn an additional certificate annually by hitting a certain amount of credit card spend. Additionally, many of the cards are also offering a free night reward as part of their welcome offer bonus.With the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card, one of its benefits is that you’ll receive a free night reward certificate on an annual basis. Plus, if you spend $60,000 on the card within a calendar year, you’ll receive another free night reward.All information about the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card has been collected independently by CNN Underscored. The Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card is not currently available through CNN Underscored.The Hilton Honors American Express Surpass Card also comes with the opportunity to receive a free night certificate on on annual basis, but requires you to spend $15,000 on your card in a calendar year. And with the current welcome offer, not only will you earn 130,000 bonus points after spending $2,000 on purchases in the first three months, you’ll also receive a free night reward.Similarly, with the Hilton Honors American Express Business Card you can also earn up to two free night reward certificates annually — one after you spend $15,000 in a calendar year, plus another certificate after you spend an additional $45,000 in the same calendar year. New card members can also earn 150,000 bonus Hilton Honors points and a free night reward after spending $4,000 on the card in the first three months after opening the account.And since all cards are treated as separate products, if approved, you could potentially earn multiple free night reward certificates after meeting the spend requirements.To add to the flexibility of these certificates, they can be used any night of the week without any black out periods. Additionally, all certificates expire 12 months from when they are deposited into your account and are typically posted between eight and 12 weeks from when they’re earned. One thing to note is that this expiration date is a “stay by” date, not a “book by” date, meaning your hotel stay has to be completed by the certificate’s expiration.To redeem your certificate, you’ll have to call Hilton at 1-800-446-6677. Unfortunately, reward certificates — unlike points — cannot be booked online.One of the nicest and most luxurious properties in Hawaii is the Grand Wailea. Sitting on 40 acres, it’s the second-largest hotel in Maui, with access to beautiful Wailea Beach. The hotel features nine pools spread over six levels and connected by a whitewater river rapid. Adults and kids can venture to the multi-size waterslides, rope swing, whitewater rapids slide, waterfalls, caves, multiple jacuzzis and a swim-up bar. You’ll also find the world’s first water elevator.Those traveling sans kids will also appreciate the 4,850-square-foot adults-only Hibiscus Pool. For the more adventurous, there’s also a scuba diving training pool. And of course, a trip to Hawaii wouldn’t be complete without surfing, which you’re able to mimic in the hotel’s rotating barrel pipe.While the hotel typically charges 110,000 points per night, you can instead use your free night reward certificate to stay in a 640-square-foot room with a private lanai, oversized shower and views of Mt. Haleakala. To be able to use a certificate at this property, you’ll want to be flexible with your travel dates or book 11 months in advance.Park City is one of the easiest ski trip destinations. At just 30 miles from Salt Lake City Airport, you can be off the plane and on the slopes in no time. And with no shortage of hotel options, it’s an easy place to stay for free using hotel loyalty programs — despite paid rates costing a pretty penny during ski season.One of the most luxurious options is the Waldorf Astoria Park City. The property is located on the Canyons Village side of the resort with a gondola to get you to the base of the mountain. The ski valet will store your skis and boots overnight, and you’ll love the heated outdoor pool and hot tubs after a long day of skiing.The hotel offers a shuttle to Main Street (located just five minutes away), Park City Base area and Deer Valley resort. Aside from getting to and from the airport, you likely won’t need to get into a car again.If you’re looking to stay during peak ski season, the property can easily cost more than $1,000 per night for a standard room. Alternatively, the property requires sometimes over 100,000 points per night. But, instead of draining your points, you can use your free night reward certificate for a free night’s stay.Located right in Beverly Hills and less than a 15-minute walk to famous Rodeo Drive, there’s nothing not to love about the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills — especially when your free night reward certificate will land you an oversized room with floor-to-ceiling windows and a private balcony. Since this property typically costs 120,000 points per night, it’s a great use of your certificate.Each room also features an Italian marble bathroom with a separate shower and bathtub and Bluetooth speakers. You’ll actually find that the entire room is set up with state-of-the-art technology where, with the touch of a button, you can control the lights, drapes and entertainment.There are also plenty of on-site dining options, including a rooftop restaurant with views of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Here, you’ll find a menu set by renowned chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. There’s also a 5,000-square-foot spa, a heated rooftop pool, a 24-hour fitness center and an on-site salon.If you’d prefer to stay along the coast during a visit to Los Angeles, another option is the Oceana Santa Monica, LXR Hotels & Resorts. At around 110,000 points per night, you’ll get great value at this property — with the beach right across the street.One of the most iconic resorts in California is the Hotel del Coronado. Located right on the beach in Coronado — across the bay from downtown San Diego — you’ll find yourself staying in a historic Victorian property with lots of charm. With plenty of availability throughout the year, booking a standard room with your certificate is quite easy and will save you around 95,000 points per night — or cash, if you were to go that route.With a true resort setting, you can spend your day at the beach or the pool, or embark on one of the many activities offered by the hotel. There’s a fire pit to roast marshmallows in the evening, surf and stand-up paddleboard lessons, spin classes on the beach, beach yoga, paddleboard yoga and tennis courts.The property also boasts an ocean-themed kids-club program. With both half-day and full-day sessions available, kids between the ages of 5 and 12 will be able to experience a living classroom and an interactive tide pool.Many New York City hotels can be small and cramped, but a stay at the Conrad New York Midtown will make you feel like a king or queen. Located on a relatively quiet street in between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue, you’re only a five-minute walk to Central Park, seven minutes from Times Square and 10 minutes from Rockefeller Center. And, with many subway stations nearby, the hotel is a very central location to explore the entire city.With your free night reward certificate, you can avoid paying around 95,000 points per night. And best of all, there’s typically a lot of availability, so you’ll be able to visit New York City during a time that works best for you.If you’re looking for a Caribbean vacation feel without leaving the United States, Key West could be a great option. But Florida hotels can be incredibly pricey, making your Hilton free night reward certificate even more valuable. The Reach Key West — one of Hilton’s higher-end properties — is typically around 95,000 points per night and is located on the only private natural sand beach in Key West.Just a few blocks away from Duval Street, you’ll have access to many bars and restaurants, and The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum is less than a 15-minute walk away. At the hotel, you can enjoy many water sports, such as sailing, scuba diving and snorkeling.There’s also a shuttle that’ll take you to the sister property next door — the Casa Marina Key West, A Waldorf Astoria Resort — where you can enjoy additional pools and restaurants. Since it’s also a Hilton hotel, you could opt to use your free night reward certificate at this property instead.The Conrad Punta de Mita is located along a 2-mile beach in Riviera Nayarit and is only 20 miles away from Puerto Vallarta Airport. At around 95,000 Hilton Honors points per night, it’s the perfect place to use your free night reward certificate.The hotel features an adults-only pool as well as a kid’s pool with waterslides and a splash zone. There are plenty of loungers and umbrellas on the beach, or you can rent your own cabana at the pool for pure relaxation.If you’re looking for daytime activities, there’s plenty to keep you occupied both on land and in the water. From kayaks and stand-up paddleboards to shuffleboard and pickleball courts, kids and adults alike will never get bored at the property. And, of course, there are many off-property excursions as well.Standard rooms are very roomy at this property, ranging between 646 square feet and 705 square feet — depending on if you select a room with one king or two queen beds — plus a furnished patio. The bathrooms are also top-notch, with marble finishings and a walk-in shower.Although getting to Anguilla can be slightly more challenging compared to some of the other Caribbean Islands, it’s well worth it to stay at the Zemi Beach House. This luxury hotel costs around 110,000 points per night and has plenty of availability. Due to the high prices for both a paid and points reservation, using a free night reward certificate is a great idea.All standard rooms include a private balcony with views of either the pool or garden. The bathrooms also include a walk-in glass shower and a deep soaking tub.The hotel is located right on Anguilla’s coastline, featuring crystal blue waters and many water sports. You’ll also have access to multiple swimming pools, five restaurants and bars and a juice bar. There’s also a complimentary kids club for those between 4 and 12 years old and weekly movie nights.Best of all — even when using a free reward night certificate — all guests receive complimentary breakfast.With London being such a popular destination with pricey hotels, it could be the perfect place to use your free night reward certificate — especially during peak summer dates when room rates are typically around 80,000 points per night.The Conrad London St. James is located in London’s Westminster neighborhood, only a 10-minute walk from Buckingham Palace. A visit to this hotel will also put you in close proximity to the Thames River, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Churchill War Rooms and even the London Eye.The hotel also features a world-class art collection, themed afternoon tea, local craft ales and a contemporary British cuisine restaurant.If you’re looking for something more exotic, you’ll love your stay at the Conrad Bora Bora Nui. Your free night reward certificate can score you a 1,000-square-foot suite with a separate lounge area and a large private terrace, which typically goes for around 120,000 Hilton Honors points per night. You can even bring the family, as the room fits up to three adults or two adults and two kids.To add to the unique experience, the Conrad offers many Polynesian activities throughout the day and evening. There are also many water sports, land activities, a golf simulator and a complimentary kids club.One downside is that finding standard award availability is extremely hard to come by. This property opens up its award calendar exactly 12 months in advance, and your best chances of snagging a room are by booking the day the room is released for the following year.If you aren’t able to find availability but you’re still yearning for that once-in-a-lifetime experience in French Polynesia, you can also look into the Hilton Moorea Lagoon Resort & Spa. Alternatively, the Maldives also offers some top-notch — and expensive — Hilton properties, such as the Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi and Conrad Maldives Rangali Island.Learn more about the Hilton Honors American Express Card with no annual fee.Learn more about the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass card.

But travel can get expensive, and instead of paying cash for your next hotel stay, there’s a great way to keep your costs down: by using travel rewards. There are many ways to accrue Hilton Honors points, but one of the easiest ways is through credit cards. And fortunately, Hilton has several credit cards that will allow you to redeem points for a free stay even easier.The highest Hilton credit card offer at the moment is the Hilton Honors American Express Business Card where you can earn 150,000 bonus points plus a free night reward after you spend $4,000 in purchases on the card within the first three months of card membership (offer ends July 19, 2023).All information about the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card has been collected independently by CNN. This card is not currently available through CNN.Then, you have the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card where you can earn 150,000 bonus points after the same $4,000 in purchases within the first three months. And while a similar offer in the number of points you’ll earn as the business card, there’s no free night reward attached to the offer.All information about the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card has been collected independently by CNN. This card is not currently available through CNN.There’s then the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card which is offering a slightly inferior offer where new card members have the chance to earn 130,000 points and a Free Night Reward after spending $2,000 on the card within the first three months.There’s also a no-annual-fee card, the Hilton Honors American Express Card, where you’ll earn a slightly inferior number of points as part of the card’s welcome bonus offer (see rates and fees). With this card, you can earn 70,000 points and a Free Night Reward after spending $1,000 in purchases within the first three months.So with 150,000 points in your back pocket, you’re probably wondering where the points can take you. And fortunately, the options are virtually endless. Whether it’s a weekend trip visiting the grandparents, experiencing Disney World for the first time or staying in an overwater bungalow in the Maldives, there’s bound to be a Hilton property for your next getaway — and one that you can get for free by using points.Or, if a hotel stay isn’t in your future, there are other ways to use your Hilton points. While they might not bring the same value as a free night where the cash rates can venture into the hundreds or thousands of dollars per night, there are redemption options to fit your needs.Here are some of the best ways to use your points earned from the welcome bonus offer on the, Hilton Amex Aspire Card, Hilton Amex Surpass Card, Hilton Honors Amex Business Card and the no-annual-fee Hilton Amex Card.You’ll typically get the best value from your Hilton Honors points for hotel stays within the Hilton portfolio. There are well over a dozen different brands within the Hilton program, including Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, DoubleTree by Hilton, Embassy Suites by Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton by Hilton and Homewood Suites, among others.Unlike some other hotel loyalty programs, Hilton doesn’t have a set award chart, but all standard rooms range between 5,000 and 150,000 points per night. All hotels have their own range, so you can see the low and high end of a particular property by using Hilton’s Point Explorer tool. When you go to make a reservation, if you use the “flexible dates” option, it’ll give you a calendar view of the number of points needed per night, which comes in handy if you’re flexible with when you can travel.Additionally, if you have any level of Hilton Honors elite status — Silver, Gold or Diamond — you’ll receive your fifth night for free when redeeming points. Fortunately, all Hilton credit cards offer some level of status, so simply by being a card holder, you’ll automatically receive your fifth night free when redeeming your points for a free stay.The ideal redemption is to use your points during a time when the cash rate is otherwise high. This will give you the best value for your points while also saving you a good amount of cash. Here are some examples for redeeming your points for maximum value.The Hilton Waikoloa Village, located on The Big Island of Hawaii, is pure paradise. But at close to $1,000 per night during peak dates, staying at this hotel is unobtainable for most. Fortunately, though, the property typically costs just 75,000 points a night, and there’s usually plenty of award availability at that rate.While you probably aren’t going to go to Hawaii for just a weekend getaway, Hilton allows you to pool your points for free with up to 10 additional people. This means if both you apply for both the Hilton Amex Surpass Card and Hilton Amex Aspire Card, you’ll end up with 280,000 Hilton Honors points and a Free Night Reward from the welcome bonus offer on the Surpass. With just a little more spend on the card (plus the points earned from meeting the minimum spend requirement), you’ll be able to earn the 300,000 points required for a five-night stay at the Hilton Waikoloa Village — remember, your fifth night is free if you’re a card holder. Or, extend your stay by tacking on the free night reward from the welcome offer.When you aren’t out exploring the island, you can experience one of the many pools, splash down a 175-foot water slide or snorkel in the saltwater lagoon filled with fish and sea turtles. The hotel also offers an on-site luau, many activities and a plethora of dining options. Being such a large property, it even features its own tram system to get you around the resort.This new-ish property in Cancun, Mexico, is an ideal place to redeem your points. As an all-inclusive resort, your points will truly cover your entire stay — no need to pull out your wallet for food and drinks.Best of all, this hotel costs around just 95,000 points per night in a standard room. Hilton also has a Points + Money feature that allows you to use a combination of points and cash if you don’t have enough points to cover an entire stay.The all-inclusive benefits at the Hilton Cancun include daily breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks, along with a stocked minibar. You’ll also have access to premium drinks and cocktails. There are 12 dining options — including five specialty restaurants — and three bars.Adults and kids alike will love the two infinity pools, a kids pool area and waterpark as well as a kids club, which is available for no additional fee. Like many other beach resorts, there are activities throughout the day and shows at night. This is one of those properties where there’s no shortage of fun.There’s nothing better than being close to the lifts during a ski vacation, and fortunately, the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Breckenridge is just a five-minute walk from getting on the slopes. At around 60,000 points per night during ski season, this is a great rate where cash rates are astronomically high.With the welcome bonus offer from the Hilton Amex Surpass, this will allow you a weekend away on the slopes — all on points. However, availability can be sparse during peak dates, so you’ll want to make sure to book ahead of time to score a standard room. During other parts of the year, you might actually find yourself able to book a standard or premium room for even fewer points.On-site, you’ll be able to rent your ski gear or store your own equipment with the hotel’s ski valet. And after a long ski day, you can relax in the hotel’s hot tub or indoor swimming pool, or take the shuttle to Main Street.Want to get the feel of the Caribbean without actually having to travel internationally? If so, Puerto Rico is a great option — no passport is needed from the mainland US, and there are plenty of hotels to choose from. The Caribe Hilton is on a relatively secluded peninsula but still close enough to Old San Juan.And best of all, the property is typically just 70,000 points per night. If you apply for both the Amex Surpass and Hilton Amex Business — yes, you are able to get the welcome bonus offer on both if eligible — that’ll give you almost enough points for a five-night stay right on the beach for free.The property features a multi-tier oceanfront pool complex with one infinity pool, two additional pools, a kids fountain pool and two whirlpools. And of course, there’s nothing better than a swim-up pool bar. You’ll also have access to a full-service spa, daily fitness programs, tennis courts and an outdoor playground.With your Hilton Honors points, you can stay in the Big Apple for as few as 28,000 points per night at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New York Times Square West. While peak dates can go up to 70,000 points per night, if you’re flexible with your dates, you’re bound to find a time frame that works with the number of points in your account.With the opportunity to earn 130,000 points and a free night reward from the Hilton Amex Surpass Card, you can easily stay anywhere between two and four nights without having to worry about the hefty New York City price tag.The hotel will give you sweeping views of the Hudson River, and you’ll be just a 10-minute walk from Times Square. You’re also very close to the Empire State Building and the Javits Center, and you’ll have easy access to many subway lines.Not every vacation needs to include a beach, a major city or a world-class ski mountain. Instead, you might just be looking for a hotel that’s close to friends, family or a particular destination. With Hilton Honors redemptions starting at just 5,000 points per night, there are still a decent number of properties that won’t break your points bank.The DoubleTree by Hilton Decatur Riverfront is an example of a property that just might fit the bill. Around just 20,000 points per night, this is a great opportunity to use your Hilton points and save a decent amount of cash. You can even stay at this property for a full week from the welcome bonus offer on the Hilton Amex Surpass Card alone.At this property, you’re able to book a room with a view of the Tennessee River for the same 20,000 points per night. You’re in close proximity to the US Space & Rocket Center and Cook Museum of Natural Science. And, at the end of the day, you can take a dip in the heated pool.If you prefer to use your travel rewards for flights instead of free hotel stays, you can still do that with your Hilton Honors points. Hilton has partnerships with more than 30 different airline programs. The transfer rate varies per partner, but here are some popular options:With these transfer ratios, you’re not getting great value from your Hilton Honors points. For example, frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Hilton points at 0.6 cents each, which means the 150,000 points earned from the welcome bonus offer on the Hilton Amex Aspire Card is worth $900. If you were to transfer all 150,000 Honors points to Virgin Atlantic, for example, you’ll receive just 22,500 Virgin Points. With Virgin Points worth 1.5 cents each, that less than a $350 valuation on the miles.For this reason, you most likely won’t want to apply for any of these three Hilton cards solely to transfer the points to airline miles. Instead, consider an airline credit card.Hilton also allows you to redeem Honors points for experiences, many of which are not an option to pay for with cash. These experiences range from unique four-course meals to spa services and even various cultural activities.As part of Hilton Honors Experiences, you can even redeem your points with Ticketmaster and Live Nation. This gives you the opportunity to see sporting events and attend concerts for free by using points. One of my favorite ways to redeem Hilton points was with its Lawn Days summer concerts. This allowed you to redeem just 10,000 Hilton Honors points for two lawn seats to see some great artists perform.If you’re not ready to think about travel just yet, you can also use your points for everyday purchases. Through the Hilton and Amazon partnership, you can redeem your Hilton Honors points to pay for any purchase made at Amazon. Points can be redeemed at a rate of 500 points per dollar spent at Amazon.While this redemption is typically not recommended — since your points are redeemed at an incredibly low 0.2 cents apiece — it’s still an option. If you ultimately just want to use your points right away for instant merchandise, it’s an easy way to use your Hilton points.Learn more about the Hilton Honors American Express Card.﻿Learn more about the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass Card.﻿Learn more about the Hilton Honors American Express Business Card.Check out CNN Underscored’s guide to the best travel credit cards currently available.",business,0.0

Couples have to plan for expenses like securing a venue, finding the right dress and hiring a caterer. Then, there are other outlays involved in getting hitched, including the price of planning the honeymoon getaway of your dreams — especially if that means a stay in a luxurious honeymoon suite.According to a survey from the wedding experts at The Knot, the average cost of a honeymoon worked out to $4,600 for couples who got married in 2021. That’s on top of the average cost of the wedding itself, which turned out to be approximately $34,000 among the more than 15,000 couples surveyed.Fortunately, there are ways to keep your honeymoon price tag in check, even if you decide to splurge on a romantic suite getaway. With travel rewards in hand, you may be able to book the honeymoon suite of your dreams for a fraction of the price.With that in mind, we’re highlighting some of the most elegant, exclusive and expensive honeymoon suites you can book with travel rewards. Keep in mind that award stays at the hotels and resorts in this guide are based on availability, so you should be flexible with your dates and prepared to lock in your reservation as soon as you find a booking you want.As the largest hotel chain in the world, there are many terrific honeymoon suite options at Marriotts around the globe. The chain offers a number of Marriott Bonvoy credit cards that can help you rack up points in the program quickly.For example, with the Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Credit Card, you can earn 30,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 in the first three months. Or, with the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card, you can earn 3 free nights (up to 50,000 points per night) after spending $3,000 in the first three months.Remember, too, that Marriott Bonvoy is a transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards and American Express Membership Rewards, so you can earn points in these programs and then transfer them to your Marriott account later when you’re ready to redeem. Having transferable currencies like this earned from cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card and The Platinum Card® from American Express gives you more flexibility when it comes to getting the most value from your points.Marriott Bonvoy award stays can be especially rewarding because the program offers the fifth night free when you book at least five consecutive nights with points. This feature can help you stretch your points further or add more free nights to your honeymoon suite stay.A honeymoon in Miami’s South Beach neighborhood could be a ton of fun, and you can cover your suite stay at the W South Beach entirely with Marriott Bonvoy points. This resort recently went through a $30 million guest room renovation, and it features a stunning oceanfront setting, a sparkling beachfront pool and delectable dining options all within walking distance of everything South Beach has to offer.During our search for honeymoon suites, we were able to find a one-night stay at the property’s huge Mega bi-level suite, which will set you back a whopping 280,000 points per night. This suite is spread across two levels with upgrades like its own private plunge pool, a kitchenette, a separate living room and a spacious balcony with plenty of space for lounging. A large outdoor terrace next to the private pool also gives honeymooners plenty of privacy as they enjoy their romantic trip.If a honeymoon in Thailand is on your bucket list and you have enough Marriott Bonvoy points, The Ritz-Carlton, Koh Samui could be within reach. This waterfront hotel offers luxurious and romantic suites that are ideal for couples who want to celebrate their nuptials in a far-flung locale. In addition to large rooms and suites, visitors will also find an elegant spa and six different restaurants and bars to choose from.We found availability for as few as 119,200 Bonvoy points per night for a stay in the resort’s Tropical Pool Villa, which comes with a private plunge pool and a separate bedroom. This outrageous suite has more than 1,000 square feet of interior space as well as its own private terrace. Couples who book this room will also find a generously sized living area and dining area, a marble bathroom with a separate shower and soaking tub and two flat-screen televisions. Nightly rates in the Tropical Pool Villa frequently cost upward of $500 per night, so booking with Bonvoy points can help you save big on your honeymoon getaway.A number of properties in the Marriott Bonvoy program also allow you to book a range of all-inclusive stays with points, including the Royalton Bavaro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. This all-inclusive property boasts its own lazy river, multiple pools and eight different restaurants in a stunning beachfront location. All of the suites at this resort even come with upgrades like a DreamBed with high-thread-count sheets and 24/7 room service.The best part? Free nights in a Luxury Junior Suite with more than 600 square feet of space start at just 50,000 points per night with double occupancy this fall. This room type offers an array of upgraded features that make it perfect for a romantic suite honeymoon, from a roomy walk-in shower and separate soaking tub to a lighted double vanity and a massive king bed. Also note that this suite features a separate living space and a mini-refrigerator.With award rates starting at 50,000 points per night, that means you could potentially get three nights for free from a single welcome bonus on the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Card. With the card, you’ll earn 3 free nights after spending $3,000 in the first three months, where each free night certificate can be redeemed for a hotel stay up to 50,000 points per night (and you can add 15,000 points from your account to top off an award). Plus, since this property is all-inclusive, all of your extras — like food and drink — are included in the price.Another all-inclusive option you can book with Marriott points is found in Cancun, Mexico. Royalton Chic Cancun is an adults-only all-inclusive resort that lets you relax and unwind without any kids in the vicinity. Guests who book their honeymoon can take advantage of the nine restaurants and seven bars on-site, book a couples massage at the property’s spa or visit the famous rooftop cabana lounge.Free nights in a Luxury Sunset View Junior Suite with double occupancy start at just 50,000 points over dates this fall. This suite is almost 600 square feet in size and features upgrades like a dedicated sitting area and an in-room mini-refrigerator. An expansive balcony provides a place for couples to get fresh air or gaze at the stars, and room service is available 24 hours per day.Again, because this suite can be had for 50,000 Bonvoy points per night, you can get a three-night stay for free with a single credit card sign-up bonus. With the Marriott Boundless Card, you’ll earn 3 free nights after spending $3,000 in the first three months.The Hilton Honors chain has no lack of suites fit for a honeymooning couple in its portfolio. Plus, earning travel rewards is easy within the Hilton Honors program. That’s because the chain offers a number of Hilton Honors credit cards. For example, the Hilton Honors American Express Card currently comes with a welcome bonus offer of 70,000 points plus a Free Night Reward after spending $1,000 in the first three months.Since Hilton Honors is also a transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards, you can also go that route. For example, if you earn points with the Amex Platinum card, you could transfer them to the Hilton Honors program. Also remember that Hilton Honors members with Silver Elite status or higher get their fifth night for free when they book at least five consecutive nights with points.Rome, Italy, boasts some of the most famous landmarks in the world. From the Colosseum to the Pantheon and the Spanish Steps, there is plenty to see to steep yourself in history. That alone makes this destination ideal for a romantic honeymoon, and a luxury stay at the iconic Rome Cavalieri can take this already-epic trip to the next level.This hotel sits above Rome with panoramic views of the city, Michelin-starred dining, its own luxury spa and relaxing pools. Art lovers will also relish this hotel’s collection, which includes more than 1,000 masterworks of paintings, tapestries, furnishings, sculptures and more.Couples can book a stunning Alcove Suite with more than 800 square feet of space, a huge terrace overlooking the city and Imperial Club access for as few as 248,000 points per night.

A roomy marble bathroom also has a separate shower and bathtub, as well as its own television.Located in the Riviera Maya region of Mexico, Hilton’s Conrad Tulum offers elevated luxury in a beachfront setting. This resort has its own upscale spa and 11 restaurants and bars delivering fresh, local cuisine and custom cocktails any time of the night or day. The location of the Hilton Conrad Tulum also puts it in close proximity to famous Mayan ruins and an array of outdoor adventures from snorkeling to ziplining.Couples who want to book a romantic space for their honeymoon can get a Tropical View Suite with a king bed and a separate living area starting at 326,000 points per night. Notable features of the suite include a relaxation tub for two on the balcony and a spa-like bathroom with a separate soaking tub, double sinks and a rainfall shower. The nightly rate for this suite normally comes in at more than $900, so you can spend the money saved on experiencing all the Riviera Maya region has to offer.A honeymoon in the Maldives is the ultimate splurge, but it’s possible to cover the cost of your hotel with points — even in a suite. The Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is well known for its unbelievable access to the Indian Ocean, but it also has an underwater restaurant and those stunning overwater bungalows this region of the world is known for.Standard night awards at this property can be difficult to find, but an award stay can cost as few as 120,000 Hilton points per night if you’re flexible with your travel dates. Fortunately, this rate also applies to a luxurious Beach Villa with direct walkout access to the white sand beach, an open-air bathroom with a rain shower and an outdoor alcove with a daybed for relaxing. The resort’s Beach Villa also features floor-to-ceiling windows so you can soak in the stunning ocean views while relaxing to the sounds of nature and the ocean outside.The World of Hyatt program has no shortage of terrific suites suitable for honeymooners. If you have the World of Hyatt Credit Card or points in the Chase Ultimate Rewards program, you can also look for honeymoon resorts that are bookable with points.The World of Hyatt card currently comes with a sign-up bonus of up to 60,000 bonus points. You’ll get 30,000 bonus points after spending $3,000 in your first three months plus up to 30,000 additional bonus points by earning 2 bonus points per dollar spent in the first six months of account opening (up to $15,000 spent).

The Hyatt Zilara Rose Hall is home to a beautiful beachfront property, perfect for swimming, with sparkling pools and unlimited dining and drinks at 10 on-site restaurants and six bars and lounges. The resort also has its own swim-up bar and a luxurious Zen Spa.A free night award at this hotel starts at just 21,000 World of Hyatt points on off-peak dates, yet honeymooners may want to splurge for the larger Ocean Front Junior Suite King. This suite starts at 36,000 points per night on off-peak dates, and it features 673 square feet of interior space, a soaking tub and separate rainfall shower, designer toiletries and a roomy balcony with a lounger that seats two. Alternatively, you could splurge and book a swim-up suite for ultimate access to a semi-private pool.This remarkable resort spans the entire Banana Bay in St. Kitts. Guests can expect golden sandy beaches as well as the beautiful turquoise-colored waters the Caribbean is known for. The beachfront resort also has two swimming pools, a variety of water sports, a spa and treatment and wellness programs to choose from.But perhaps the biggest draw for honeymooners is the suites that are available. For example, you can book the Plunge Pool Rooftop Deluxe Suite for 50,000 points per night on standard dates. The suite offers 905 square feet of interior space in addition to 1,305 square feet of space on your own private deck — with a plunge pool, of course.

This resort is home to 81 beach and overwater villas, six restaurants and bars and extensive wellness facilities to boot.You can even book an Overwater Pool Villa with its own private plunge pool for 120,000 IHG Rewards points per night, where other exclusive luxury hotels charge significantly more points for overwater rooms. These villas offer more than 1,000 square feet of room with features like a private infinity pool and a cushioned daybed for daytime relaxation or stargazing. An open-air floor plan will leave you feeling comfortable and spoiled, and so will the fact that all villas receive housekeeping services twice per day.Bora Bora is one of the most popular dream destinations for honeymooners, and it’s easy to see why.

373,397,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/chanel-cruise-2023-show-los-angeles-barbie/index.html,Malibu Barbies and Hollywood starlets: See inside Chanel’s Los Angeles catwalk show,2023-05-11 14:06:00,"Los Angeles (CNN) — The worlds of film and high fashion have long been intertwined. Whether through costume design, red carpet fashion moments or celebrity-led campaigns, the two industries have developed a powerful symbiotic relationship. Which is why the location for Chanel’s 2023/24 peppy and playful Cruise show, which the brand presented at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles on Tuesday night, made perfect sense.“Together, fashion and cinema lead us into a waking dream,” the show notes promised, “nourished by an energetic invitation to step into the spotlight and never leave the dance floor.”But there is also a personal connection between the French fashion house and Hollywood. Virginie Viard, Chanel’s creative director since the death of Karl Lagerfeld in 2019, worked in costume design in the beginning of her career; Coco Chanel herself was famously persuaded by film producer Samuel Goldwyn to come to Hollywood in 1931 to ensure his films’ fashions wouldn’t look outdated by the time they were released. She ended up with more than a half dozen of costume design credits under her belt.Serving as Viard’s “ode to the City of Angels,” the runway show marked Chanel’s return to Los Angeles after some 16 years away. (In 2007, Lagerfeld unveiled his 2008 Cruise collection in a Santa Monica airport hangar. Models strutted out from two Challenger 601 jets onto a literal runway, while the era’s It girls — Lindsay Lohan, Mischa Barton, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, among others — looked on.)A lot has changed in the years between the LA of the late aughts and the LA of today. While the city has always been a centerpiece for American celebrity culture, its luminaries have changed — or, at least, their playing field has expanded. Today’s fashion influencers are the darlings of social media and subcultures as much as they are long-established actors and socialites, with fanbases spanning the globe and the Internet. Luxury brands like Chanel have learned to embrace that and, while still staying true to their heritage, reinventing their aesthetic to celebrate the old and the new, drawing from the past while looking to the future.But as much as our definition of celebrity has evolved, the glamour and aspiration so closely associated with fame remain, as they do in fashion. For Chanel, curating this frisson began with their show’s invitations. Designed by the French artist André Saraiva as an apparent play on festival lineup posters, each guest’s name was listed, headliner-style, above those of A-List Chanel ambassadors like Margaret Qualley, Kristen Stewart, and Margot Robbie. The result? Very Coachella. (In other words, very LA.) If Chanel’s aim was to make everyone feel like a star, it worked.Inside Paramount’s lot, the runway itself was set up almost like a football stadium, with bleacher seats, scoreboards and stadium lighting. Chloe Sevigny, Elle Fanning, Halsey, Kris Jenner, H.E.R., Kimora Lee Simmons, Paris Hilton, and Sofia Richie were just a few of the stars in attendance.As the show began, a massive screen showed a short video of Chanel ambassador Alma Jodorowsky. In the clip, the actress — granddaughter of director Alejandro Jodorowsky — was seen lifting weights on a West Coast-worthy beachscape, styled and performing like an ’80s Workout Barbie.In fact, there were a lot of Barbie references in the show: Pink leisurely looks, sherbet-colored tweed sets, and lace dresses and tote bags in ombré shades that brought Pacific sunsets to mind. (The show notes highlighted the use of gold in particular, “evoking cinema’s halcyon age, its empress-like actresses, the bright lights of the projectors and the eternal California sunshine.”)A couple of pieces featured a funky, pastel graphic print perfect for a doll’s wardrobe; another highlight was the light-up rainbow heels that featured in a number of the looks. This wasn’t a first for Chanel, as Lagerfeld used light-up heels in collections in 2008 and 2011, but Viard’s take was nostalgic and uber-feminine.Surely, Robbie will be taking a few of these outfits on her “Barbie” press tour.“There’s that fun, playful side that Karl kind of started, from the original Chanel that is super elegant and chic,” director and Chanel ambassador Sofia Coppola, who also attended the show, told CNN in a phone interview the day after the show. “I feel like Virginie continues with that spirit, but in her own way.”The collection wasn’t all candy colors; there were black leather dresses, cut-out bodysuits, aerobics-worthy activewear and a few silhouettes that paid tribute to Old Hollywood glamour with a modern twist. “Between the dream on one hand and what you want to wear on the other, it’s all a question of balance,” Viard explained, per the show notes. The show’s soundtrack also paralleled these dichotomies, as dance tunes from Felix da Housecat alternated with moody movie scores from Tom Ford’s “Nocturnal Animals” and 1992’s “Basic Instinct.”“Virginie has a background in costume design, so when you see the girls go by, there are different personas,” said Coppola. “She creates these different characters and I love seeing that.”After the runway came to a close, that dance floor promised by the show notes became a reality thanks to a surprise performance from Snoop Dogg — with an Anderson Paak cameo to boot. As the crowd sang along to “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” sliced fruit with Tajin seasoning, an LA street food delicacy, was passed out just in time for Snoop to ask the age-old question: “Who’s got that sticky-icky?”With an inherent part of fashion and Hollywood’s continued collaboration being the endless hunt for the next trends and trendsetters, it’s often the age-old questions that are the most prescient. As Coppola puts it, it’s about curating, “more of an approachable attitude towards fashion, and fun.”Top image: Models walk the runway during the finale of Chanel’s 2023/24 Cruise show.",style,0.0
374,398,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/beyonce-renaissance-tour-loewe-bodysuit-lotw/index.html,Look of the Week: Beyoncé kicks off ‘Renaissance’ tour in ‘hands-on’ bodysuit,2023-05-11 05:16:00,"Beyoncé kicked off her hotly anticipated “Renaissance” world tour in Sweden on Wednesday night — and, true to form, it was a night of numerous outfit changes. It was also a night of (nearly as many) custom bodysuits.There was a silvery Courrèges one with an iridescent circular cutout at its center; a sparkling Alexander McQueen one that flared elegantly at the hips; and a Balmain one embroidered with an intricate web of pearls.But the bodysuit that truly set the internet alight came courtesy of Spanish label Loewe.Bejeweled with gold crystal appliqué, the sparkling one-piece featured a series of strategically placed hand motifs, each decorated with long red nails.Two of the “hands” reached up the star’s legs, two covered more intimate body parts and two rested on her posterior (as revealed when the singer turned her back to the audience during a rendition of “Drunk in Love”). She completed the look with a pair of matching black rubber latex gloves with their own sets of red nails.“That Loewe bodysuit Beyoncé is wearing will be in history books,” wrote one Twitter user. “I need that hands bodysuit asap,” wrote another.The look was conceived by Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson, who — fresh from overseeing Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show outfit — is among the world’s most in-demand fashion designers. His sensual hand motifs previously appeared on a sleeveless dress as part of the label’s Fall-Winter 2022 collection, which debuted at Paris Fashion Week last year.Working in collaboration with stylist Shiona Turini, Loewe also created a second bodysuit for the tour. That one was covered in silver Swarovski crystals and was paired with matching cargo trousers. In a press release, Loewe said the two outfits played on “sculptural forms, trompe l’oeil and illusion,” adding that Anderson had been inspired by the “escapist joy” of Beyoncé’s latest album.Wednesday marked the first of Beyoncé’s two-night stop in the Swedish capital, Stockholm. Between now and the end of September, her tour will travel to 40 cities across Europe and North America.The show wardrobe appears to be a veritable who’s-who of high fashion, with designs by Coperni and David Koma also spotted during the three-hour debut performance.In one of the night’s most eye-catching moments, a white gown by innovative Japanese label Anrealage was transformed into technicolor when two mechanical arms “sprayed” it with UV light. Elsewhere, Queen Bey continued her long tradition of wearing bee-inspired stage outfits in a yellow and black Mugler number — complete, of course, with an antennae headpiece.",style,0.0
375,399,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/peter-do-helmut-lang-designer-bof/index.html,Helmut Lang hires Peter Do as new creative director,2023-05-10 17:10:00,"New York-based designer Peter Do will oversee Helmut Lang’s men’s and women’s collections, effective May 15. His debut collection, spring 2024, will be presented during New York Fashion Week later this year.Since launching his namesake label in 2018, Do has quickly emerged as a rising star in the industry, known for sharp tailoring and a modern take on workwear. As a student at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology, his 2014 graduation collection had won the LVMH prize for young fashion designers. Soon after, he was hired by Celine, under Phoebe Philo, and also designed for Derek Lam.In his new role, Do will lend this credibility to the ailing Helmut Lang brand, which has seen a revolving door of designers since its namesake founder left the label in 2005.

376,400,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/basquiat-modena-paintings-basel-tan/index.html,Rarely-seen Basquiat paintings reunited 41 years after canceled show,2023-05-09 21:56:00,"More than four decades after Jean-Michel Basquiat and his gallerists canceled a contentious exhibition in Italy featuring eight newly commissioned paintings, a new exhibition is reuniting all of the works for the first time.“Basquiat: The Modena Paintings,” which will open next month at the Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, includes “The Guilt of Gold Teeth,” which sold for $40 million at Christie’s in 2021.In 1982, the Italian gallerist Emilio Mazzoli invited Basquiat to make the works for a one-off show, providing work premises and painting supplies. The graffiti artist painted over discarded canvases used by another artist, Mario Schifano, scrawling “Modena” on the back. But complications over payment of the works led to the cancellation of the planned exhibition in Europe just as he was reaching worldwide fame.Each of the large-scale works are now held in eight separate private collections in the US, Asia and Switzerland.In a 1985 interview with the New York Times, Basquiat outlined how much he disliked the Modena experience. “They set it up for me so I’d have to make eight paintings in a week,” he said. Meanwhile, working in the provided warehouse premises felt to him “like a factory, a sick factory,” he added. “I hated it.” The works found new buyers via Basquiat’s New York dealer at the time, Annina Nosei.The “Modena Paintings” share several motifs and stylistic features, according to a Fondation Beyeler statement, including “a monumental, often black figure set against a background of broad, gestural and expressive brushstrokes… the human and the animal body take center stage.”Sam Keller, the director of the Fondation Beyeler, told The Art Newspaper: “With every next generation, the importance of Basquiat’s work is increasing further. His combination of images and words referring to high and popular culture, history, science, social and economic injustice was truly ahead of his time and more relevant today than ever. The Modena paintings were created over 40 years ago and have never been shown together before. It’s going to be exciting to finally reunite them.”The average insurance value of each of these works is $100 million with the group of eight works totaling $800 million, according to the Fondation Beyeler.The market boom for Basquiat continues with major works by the late US street artist dominating sales season in New York this month. “Moon View,” from 1984, from the collection of the late music mogul Mo Ostin, will go on the block at Sotheby’s on May 16, with a high estimate of $10 million. That same week, Christie’s is offering “El Gran Espectaculo (The Nile),” from 1983, from the collection of Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani, on May 15 with an estimate in the region of $45 million.Top image: “The Guilt of Gold Teeth” by Basquiat.",style,0.0
377,401,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/prince-harry-spare-ghostwriter-scli-intl/index.html,Prince Harry’s ‘Spare’ ghostwriter reveals the process behind record-breaking memoir,2023-05-09 07:55:00,"The ghostwriter behind Prince Harry’s memoir “Spare” has revealed how the pair sparred during the process of writing the book, and Harry’s joy that he was finally able to communicate directly with the public.The Duke of Sussex’s explosive memoir, published earlier this year, launched a series of incendiary accusations against members of the royal family. The book revealed a number of private confrontations between him and other senior royals and detailed his highly publicized split from the clan in 2020.Now, the ghostwriter who worked with Prince Harry on the memoir has revealed details of the process, which began in the summer of 2020.In an op-ed piece for the New Yorker, published Monday, J. R. Moehringer writes about how his family was harassed by the press after his identity was leaked, and how journalists misrepresented parts of the duke’s story.Moehringer starts by recounting a row with Harry during the editing process, when the prince wanted to include a clever retort he had made after some fellow soldiers had brought up his dead mother, Princess Diana, during a military training exercise. Prince Harry served in the British Army for 10 years, completing two tours of Afghanistan and retiring from service in 2015.Harry revealed that people had always questioned his intellect, and he felt that the passage would show that he “had his wits about him,” even after being kicked, punched and deprived of sleep and food.Moehringer pushed back, and at one point feared he had gone too far.But then Harry “shot me a mischievous grin,” writes Moehringer, before the prince told him: “‘I really enjoy getting you worked up like that.’”The idea that Harry was intent on pushing back against public perceptions comes up again later in Moehringer’s piece.“Harry couldn’t escape the wish that ‘Spare’ might be a rebuttal to every lie ever published about him,” writes Moehringer, adding that “Harry dreams of endless retractions.”But before the book could be published, someone leaked Moehringer’s identity, leading to scrutiny of his life and his relationship with Harry.Then a bookshop in Madrid started selling copies of the book a week early, sparking a wave of news stories based on “bad translations” from the Spanish version, writes Moehringer.However, the English-language release didn’t improve matters, adds the ghostwriter.“Facts were wrenched out of context, complex emotions were reduced to cartoonish idiocy, innocent passages were hyped into outrages — and there were so many falsehoods,” writes Moehringer.He described the reaction as one of a “frenzied mob,” adding that soon the attacks coalesced around questioning the accuracy of the book.Before long Moehringer and his family were being harassed by the press, with a photographer lying in wait as he dropped his son off at preschool and a journalist appearing at the window of his study.“I’d worked hard to understand the ordeals of Harry Windsor, and now I saw that I understood nothing. Empathy is thin gruel compared with the marrow of experience,” writes Moehringer.“One morning of what Harry had endured since birth made me desperate to take another crack at the pages in ‘Spare’ that talk about the media.”Moehringer wondered whether Harry would also be feeling the strain of the media coverage, but recalls how the prince was “overjoyed” at a party to celebrate the book’s release.Not only had Guinness World Records named “Spare” the fastest-selling nonfiction book ever, readers were leaving “overwhelmingly effusive” reviews after reading the actual text, rather than media reviews, writes Moehringer.He describes how there were tears in his and Harry’s eyes as the prince addressed the guests, telling them how he finally felt “free.”But for Moehringer, “free” wasn’t quite the right word.“Harry first felt liberated when he fell in love with Meghan, and again when they fled Britain, and what he felt now, for the first time in his life, was heard,” Moehringer writes.Top image: J.R.

Damage caused by the blast costs $1.1 billion.Hot ash causes forest fires. Snow melt from the top of the mountain causes floods.Volcanic ash spreads across the Northwest. More than 900,000 tons of ash are cleaned up from areas around Washington.1980-1986 - Many small eruptions occur.September 2004 - Several days of unusual seismic activity lead seismologists to believe that an explosion resulting from steam buildup is likely to occur.October 2004 - Several small steam and ash explosions occur.March 8, 2005 - Releases a column of smoke and ash nearly six miles high, leaving a plume visible for more than 50 miles.January 2008 - Eruptions that have occured continously since October 2004 cease.July 2014 - Final preparations begin for what geophysicists call the “equivalent of a combined ultrasound and CAT scan” of the inside of the volcano. The joint project by scientists at Rice University, the University of Washington, the University of Texas at El Paso and others involves placing 3,500 seismic sensors around the volcano. The project will take four years and aims to improve volcanic monitoring and advance warning systems.November 3, 2015 - Scientists investigating the interior of the volcano present the first results at the Geological Society of America convention, saying there is not only a magma chamber directly below Mount St. Helens, there are other chambers east of the mountain that appear to be connected, with magma flowing between them.Spring 2016 - Over the course of eight weeks, more than 130 small earthquakes occur beneath the surface of Mount St. Helens.October 2018 - Ranks No. 2 on the US Geological Survey’s report of the most threatening volcanoes in the United States.

It’s a much needed chance to make progress on some of these powerful, challenging wildfires,” Tucker said.Firefighters now hope that cooler temperatures and higher humidity will help them battle the flames in the south and central part of the province – but challenging conditions remain in the northern part of the province, Tucker said.“Up north, it’s still very dry. We’re still seeing winds and we are expecting a continuation of those kinds of conditions that can lead to extreme wildfire behavior,” she said in the Sunday evening news conference.Communities in Alberta have seen some extremely hot temperatures in the past week, with the capital city of Edmonton hitting 31 degrees Celsius, about 88 degrees Fahrenheit, on Wednesday and Thursday – more than 10 degrees above average, according to the Canada Centre for Climate Services.The region has also seen a lack of precipitation which may have contributed to the extreme fire conditions in Alberta, drying out land and making fires more difficult to contain, CNN Meteorologist Robert Shackelford said.Tucker said crews faced with “rapidly changing wildfires across the province” will continue to focus their efforts on fires that are threatening communities.Meanwhile, multiple hospitals have been fully evacuated and many roads are closed in north and central Alberta, according to province officials.So far, about 5,000 people have sought refuge at evacuation centers, Alberta Emergency Management chief Colin Blair said in the Sunday news conference.As of Monday, 54 schools have been forced to close, affecting 10,500 students, and contingency plans are being developed, Mike Ellis, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Services, said in the briefing.Additionally, 300 patients from long-care facilities have been safely evacuated from various locations across Alberta.As thousands of Albertans flee their homes and head to evacuation centers, they leave not knowing whether they’ll have a home to return to when the evacuation orders are lifted.Rick Laboucan, who grew up in the community of Fox Lake, told CNN affiliate CTV that his family home won’t be there when the community returns.“My whole family’s side over there, our little village side there on the north Fox Lake is all wiped out,” Laboucan said. “Family and friends’ homes are gone.”An out-of-control wildfire has burned more than 16,300 hectares of land, about 40,200 acres, as of Sunday in the community of Fox Lake, authorities said.It remains unclear just how much damage the fires have left as the thick smoke and heavy fire conditions keep crews from fully assessing property loss, Blair said.“We know structures have been lost, but our first priority is protecting lives and dealing with the emergency response first and foremost,” Blair said.Officials do know that dozens of structures have been damaged, including in the Fox Lake area, where 56 firefighters with heavy equipment and aircraft are battling the flames, authorities said.Many have also been ordered to flee in Yellowhead County, where immediate evacuations were ordered for 8,000 people. Another 3,600 were ordered to evacuate from Little Red River Cree Nation.Another out-of-control wildfire dubbed EWF-031 has burned about 77,920 hectares of land, about 192,500 acres, as it rages southeast of the town of Edson in Yellowhead County, according to Alberta fire officials.Smith has said it’s an “unprecedented situation our province is facing.”On Monday, Smith announced that financial assistance would be available to evacuees.“Every adult who has been evacuated and displaced for seven consecutive days will receive a $1,250 along with an additional $500 for each dependent ending child under age 18,” the premier said.Smith said the application process will move swiftly so that people can receive evacuation payments as soon as possible.

384,408,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/uk/eurovision-song-contest-explainer-2023-intl/index.html,"What on earth is Eurovision, and how can you watch it?",2023-05-11 09:33:00,"The Eurovision Song Contest is back in Britain for the first time in more than two decades, and this year’s edition is one of the most anticipated ever.But the famously kitsch competition can be confusing, to say the least.Here’s what first-timers need to know about Eurovision – and how they can follow Saturday’s grand final.In simple terms, it’s an international singing competition organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). It takes place once a year, and is hosted by the previous edition’s winning country. There are two semi-finals, and a grand final.The widely told story of the origins of Eurovision is surprisingly noble. Tasked with bringing together a continent torn apart by war, the fledgling EBU organized a musical contest. Seven countries took part the first time around – now around 40 compete each year.Any member country of the EBU can take part, and that includes countries on the fringes of Europe such as Morocco, Jordan, Israel – and even Australia, which has recently been invited to join.For the first time ever, the contest is being held on behalf of another nation.Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra won last year, with a wave of support across Europe sweeping the nation to victory.But the UK finished second, its best result in decades, and was asked to host the contest once it became clear that Russia’s ongoing invasion would prevent Ukraine from hosting.Liverpool, the home of the Beatles, was selected to take the honors, and the city has been transformed for the competition. There are Ukrainian-themed displays around the city, and 3,000 discounted tickets were made available to displaced people from Ukraine.Twenty-six countries will compete in the finals, with the bulk having to compete in semi-finals to meet the handful of nations who are automatic qualifiers – France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom – as well as last year’s winner Ukraine.Each country performs a three-minute song once, during a very, very long and somewhat emotionally draining broadcast. Singers can sing in any language – most choose English, but plenty opt for their own – and they don’t even need to be from the competing country.Then, every country hands out points to their favorite competing nations, separately revealing the scores from an expert jury and the public vote. Countries give 12 points to their top dog, 10 to their second-favorite, and between one and eight for their honorable mentions.Votes are read out, via satellite link, by a national celebrity in each of the countries that entered the contest, so we get a whistlestop tour of dozens of European capital cities.It’s huge. Some 161 million people watched last year’s event, according to the EBU. Certain regions within Europe take it especially seriously – Scandinavian nations have long been obsessed and can boast a long list of winners.In Iceland last year, nearly 97% of televisions that were tuned into something were showing Eurovision, the EBU said.Ireland has the most wins, with seven, but the majority of those were from the early days of the contest, and Sweden needs just one more victory to equal that record. Monaco is the smallest country to have won, with its David vs. Goliath triumph coming in 1971.Eurovision is well-known for its more eccentric acts, who give the competition its charm and unmistakable style.In the past few years we’ve seen heavy metal acts, a Norwegian techno duo dressed as yellow wolves, a pair of rapping Montenegrin astronauts, an all-female Polish group who churned butter throughout their performance, and Ukrainian superstar Verka Serduchka, whose iconic and turbocharged performance came in second place.Not quite every country opts for such an over-the-top spectacle. On Saturday, as is the case every year, there will be a handful of drab ballads about peace, and a few more about love. But with every nation keen to stand out from the pack, even the most straightforward tunes can be presented in some eyebrow-raising ways.So expect bright colors, perhaps some magic tricks, a few questionable hairstyles… and most importantly, expect the unexpected.Viewers in EBU member countries can vote for any nation apart from their own, leading to some infamously political vote-lending.And this year, for the first time, people anywhere else in the world can vote too.“The Eurovision Song Contest, the world’s largest live music event, is now approaching its 70th anniversary. In order to keep the event relevant and exciting we regularly update the format to ensure it continues to thrive,” the contest explained.If you’re in one of the countries that are newly able to vote, you’ll have to visit the official Eurovision website and enter your credit card details in order to ensure the global voting is fair.All the details are explained by the EBU here.In the United States, Eurovision is being streamed exclusively by Peacock. Its grand final coverage starts at  3 p.m. ET (8 p.m. UK time) Saturday.Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir is providing commentary, for the second year in a row.“Last year was, was such an exciting moment for me in my career as a broadcaster and as an entertainer, because I’m just such a huge fan of the Eurovision Song Contest. When I got the call to go in to host it, I could not get over it,” Weir told CNN in a recent interview. “I’m still not over it. It’s still mind boggling.”Viewers can participate with Weir via “Watch With” by submitting questions to the host as they watch the competition together.The former professional ice skater is a super fan of the annual competition, which pits singers, who must perform live, from participating countries against each other and has become a worldwide phenomenon.Across Europe, the contest is shown by national broadcasters. This year’s host broadcaster in Liverpool is the BBC.",world,0.0
385,409,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/world/carbon-capture-removal-pollution-climate-intl/index.html,"What is carbon capture? Some say it will help save the world, for others it’s a dangerous distraction",2023-05-11 08:43:00,"The window to prevent catastrophic climate change is closing. Concentrations of planet-warming carbon pollution in the air are at their highest level in more than 2 million years – and the world has yet to even hit peak fossil fuel emissions.The crisis is so urgent that scientists and governments are scrambling to find ways to remove some of this carbon pollution from the air, and to capture what’s still being produced by power plants and industrial facilities.Long considered controversial, these techniques are increasingly landing a starring role in climate policies.In its 2022 report, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that “all available studies require at least some kind of carbon dioxide removal to reach net zero” – where the world removes as much planet-heating pollution from the atmosphere as it emits.Even if emissions fall significantly, the world would still need to remove between around 10 to 20 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year, according to the IPCC.Very few people claim that carbon capture and removal alone will solve climate change.“There’s no silver bullet here,” said Howard Herzog, Senior Research Engineer in the MIT Energy Initiative, who has studied carbon capture for four decades. But it’s “a tool in our portfolio” of options, he told CNN.Others, however, fear that this is a reckless bet on technology that is expensive, unproven at scale and too far away from full development to provide a meaningful answer to the climate crisis.And they criticize these technologies as a dangerous distraction from policies to cut down fossil fuel use.“Carbon capture” is often used as catch-all term for what are actually two sets of technologies – carbon capture and carbon removal. But there are important differences.Carbon capture reduces the amount of carbon pollution that would otherwise go into the atmosphere by catching it at the source of pollution, then storing it or reusing it.It works like this: Instead of sending carbon pollution (or “flue gas”) from burning fossil fuels up a smokestack and into the atmosphere, it is trapped and put through a chemical process.The most common way to do that, said Herzog, is to put the flue gas into contact with a liquid solvent, which pulls the CO2 out in a process called chemical scrubbing. The CO2 is then compressed to knock out the water and sent by pipeline, or sometimes by ship, to a location where it can be reused or stored.For long-term storage, “really the only option is to put it deep underground,” Herzog said. This requires the right geological conditions. Sandstone, a porous rock, is particularly good, he said, and a layer of denser rock on top like shale will stop the carbon seeping through.The captured carbon can also be reused to make other products, such as chemicals, fuel and cement. But the climate benefit will depend on how long the carbon is trapped. Captured carbon used in carbonated drinks, for example, will just escape right back into the air.Another way captured carbon has been used, and one which has helped make this technology controversial, is in a process called “enhanced oil recovery.” The carbon is pushed into wells to to force out the hard-to-reach remnants of oil – allowing fossil fuel companies to squeeze more from aging oil fields.Carbon removal refers to a slew of different techniques which aim to remove carbon pollution that is already in the atmosphere and lock it up permanently.Trees and oceans are natural carbon sinks – they remove more carbon from the atmosphere than they contribute.“But as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it is harder for nature to do its job,” Jan Mazurek, senior director of the carbon dioxide removal program at the non-profit ClimateWorks Foundation, told CNN.So, humans are trying to develop ways of speeding up carbon removal.Some techniques are low-tech, such as mass tree planting. Others seek to supercharge natural processes, like seeding the oceans with nutrients to increase the growth of carbon-storing marine life, or spreading crushed rock on land to cause chemical reactions that capture carbon from the air.“Biochar” involves burning wood, leaves and dead plants in a low oxygen environment to produce a form of charcoal, which can be added to soil like a fertilizer to increase crop growth.Other carbon removal technologies have similarities to parts of carbon capture.One, called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, involves planting trees or crops, which take up carbon from the air, and then burning them to produce energy. The carbon pollution created is trapped and stored by injecting it deep underground.Direct air capture, possibly the most high-profile carbon removal technique, uses machines to suck in air and then extracts the carbon using chemicals. This can then be injected deep underground or reused.Many of these technologies are at an early stage, remain prohibitively expensive and are a long way from being big enough to have a significant impact.Carbon removal technologies may need to be scaled up by a factor of 1,300 by 2050 to meet the Paris Climate Agreement pledge to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to a January report led by authors from the University of Oxford – and few countries have plans to do this.Roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide are currently removed globally every year and only a tiny fraction – 0.1% – comes from technologies such as direct air capture, the report found.There are 18 direct air capture plants operating globally, all small-scale. Together they remove around 10,000 tons of carbon a year, according to the International Energy Agency.The Orca plant, run by Swiss company Climeworks in Iceland, claims to be the world’s largest, with capacity to remove 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year.The difficulty is that, while the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising very quickly, it still makes up only about 0.04% of air. That makes removing carbon directly from the air significantly more energy-intensive and expensive than removing it from smokestacks, where carbon concentrations are far higher.When it comes to carbon capture and storage, there are approximately 35 commercial facilities in operation around the world, according to the International Energy Agency, capturing nearly 50 million tons of carbon a year.While there are hundreds of these facilities in development, even if all they all start operating, “deployment would remain substantially below what is required in the Net Zero Scenario,” said the IEA on its website.The Biden administration has provided incentives for carbon capture and removal under the Inflation Reduction Act, including through tax credits.In December, the US announced $3.7 billion to “kick start” a carbon capture and removal industry.“No matter how fast we decarbonize the nation’s economy, we must tackle the legacy pollution already in our atmosphere to avoid the worst effects of climate change,” US Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm said in a statement at the time.What’s still holding many of these technologies back is the economics, Herzog said. A coal plant without carbon capture, for example, is always going to be much cheaper to run than one with carbon capture, unless policy changes.Proposed regulations to cap the amounts of planet-heating pollution from US power plants could help. The new rules wouldn’t mandate carbon capture technology but would incentivize it.Other countries are doing more, Herzog said. “In Europe, the policies are becoming stronger and forcing industry to react.”The EU, which already has an emissions trading system putting a price of around $100 on each ton of carbon pollution, has set a target to store at least 55 million tons of CO2 annually by 2030.Every form of carbon removal or capture comes with questions and potential problems.There are concerns over the amount of land required for mass tree planting or for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and the possibility that could clash with land needed to grow food.Direct air capture remains very expensive, and despite big industry promises that costs will plummet as the technology develops, there’s a long way to go to see if this is plausible, Herzog said.This technology also requires huge amounts of clean energy to run, said Holly Buck, Assistant Professor of Environment and Sustainability at the University at Buffalo, adding to the demand as the world looks to electrify everything from cars to homes.“There’s going to be a lot of demand for this new renewable capacity. Policymakers have to be really smart about figuring out where that goes,” she told CNN.There are also concerns about the impacts of transporting and storing carbon, a key feature of carbon capture and several carbon removal techniques.Pipelines can leak, potentially contaminating drinking water and causing health problems. More than 40 people needed hospital treatment after a carbon pipeline leaked in Mississippi in 2020.“The pipeline needs to be built the right way, in the right places and well monitored,” Buck said. “That, I think, is one of the major challenges. It’s addressable, but it requires really good regulation and monitoring.”Perhaps one of the most persistent criticisms of these technologies is their potential to distract from policies to phase out fossil fuels and instead give polluters a license to keep polluting.In 2021, hundreds of organizations signed an open letter to President Joe Biden and top lawmakers in Congress, arguing that “technological carbon capture is a dangerous distraction.”“It is the fossil fuel industry’s excuse for inaction and delay,” Lili Fuhr, Director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, told CNN.But others say it cannot be an either-or question.“We are now, unfortunately, at a point where we can’t leave any option off the table to avert dangerous warming,” Mazurek said.There are going to be industries, such as cement, that are all but impossible to decarbonize in the near-term, said Herzog. It’s here carbon capture and removal technologies will be needed. “That’s not a distraction,” he said, “That’s a solution where there’s no other solution.”Still, he added, “the best way to remove CO2 from the air is not to release it into the air in the first place.”",politics,0.0

In such instances, smoke high in the atmosphere results in the formation of light-reflecting particles called aerosols, which can cool the climate and ultimately create favorable conditions for La Niña.This time researchers found that smoke aerosols from the unprecedented Australia wildfire season had brightened cloud decks, especially off the coast of Peru, which cooled and dried the air in the region. That ultimately shifted the zone where the northern and southern trade winds come together, cooling the Pacific Ocean and creating the perfect conditions for the La Niña formation.Although the emissions from the fires lingered in the atmosphere for several months, it triggered an even longer feedback loop that created successive La Niña weather patterns for years.“The results here suggest a potential connection between this emergence of cool conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the climate response to the Australian wildfire emissions,” the paper stated.Australian climate scientist Tom Mortlock, who was not involved in the study, said the research was “the first time a bushfire event has been widespread enough to have an impact in climate models,” and highlighted the “interconnectivity of the climate system.”The recent La Niña streak is also unusual because it is the only one that did not follow a strong El Niño – the opposite pattern of warming instead of cooling in the Tropical Pacific.This year, weather agencies are forecasting a more severe El Niño, exacerbated by warming global temperatures, which may bring impacts like extreme heat, dangerous tropical cyclones and a significant threat to fragile coral reefs.",world,0.0

If a slope becomes too unstable, events such as rockslides may occur,” she told CNN.The village, which houses less than 100 residents, according to Swiss public broadcaster SRF, is located in Switzerland’s eastern canton of Graubünden.SRF reported that geological surveys suggested that the situation has become more precarious.According to a statement by the Albula/Alvra municipality, over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimeters each year, however the movement has accelerated over the last 20 years, and the landslide has now been moving about one meter per year.This story has been updated to correct the map showing the location of Brienz.",world,0.0

I never imagined that as I focus on my country’s most marginalized people — venturing down uncharted vagabond pathways — I could still be considered for the highest of honors in the architectural profession,” Lari said in a statement. “There are innumerable opportunities to implement principles of circular economy, de-growth, transition design, eco-urbanism, and what we call Barefoot Social Architecture (BASA) to achieve climate resilience, sustainability and eco justice in the world.”“I believe (the recognition) is a reflection of the emerging consciousness, particularly among young professionals, who wish to fashion a new world order in the face of challenges posed by rising disparities, homelessness and climate change,” she told CNN.Born in Pakistan in 1941, Lari studied at Oxford Brookes University before returning to Pakistan in 1964 where she overcame “considerable challenges” to establish Lari Associates, her own architecture firm, creating glitzy buildings for major government, business, and financial institutions.  But she developed a deepening sense of guilt over the amount of concrete and steel used, and has said she has been “atoning” ever since, now working to a mantra of “low cost, zero carbon, zero waste.”In 1980, Lari co-founded the Karachi-based Heritage Foundation of Pakistan with her husband, Suhail Zaheer Lari, pioneering the design of self-build sustainable shelters and housing. She also designed the self-build Chulah Cookstove, a lower emission and safer alternative to the traditional stove. Over 80,000 are now in use.Since her ‘retirement’ in 2000, Lari has focused solely on humanitarian work, which has garnered international recognition; she told The Guardian in 2020 that, “It’s not only the right of the elite to have good design.” In the aftermath of last year’s devastating floods in Pakistan, hundreds of Lari’s prefabricated bamboo shelters,  which can be erected by team of six or seven people in just a matter of hours, were created for those in need from locally-sourced materials, and at a cost of just 25,000 Pakistani rupees ($108) each. The efforts are ongoing.RIBA President Simon Allford said, “Lari’s mission during her ‘second’ career has empowered the people of Pakistan through architecture, engaging users in design and production. She has shown us how architecture changes lives for the better… She has reacted imaginatively and creatively making affordable projects that address the real and often urgent need for accommodation, and basic services.”Now focusing on the repair and regeneration of a key district of historic Lahore, Lari’s work builds on her commitment to recycling materials and buildings. “Architecture isn’t just about the brick and mortar,” she told CNN Style last year. “It’s about seeing how you can help build communities.”Top image: Yasmeen Lari at the Zero Carbon Women Center on Bamboo Stilts in Pakistan, 2011.",style,0.0

A subterranean apartment anchored by ceiling beams made from plastic bottles and construction dirt. A carbon-neutral furniture factory that doubles as a 300-acre public park. These are just a few of the latest design-driven buildings that are reimagining sustainable architecture, according to Architectural Digest.In the face of the climate crisis,  the magazine’s international issue features a number of innovative projects offering solutions to high carbon emissions, energy consumption and wasteful construction materials. “Sustainability, as a concept, has become a bit of a catchall,” wrote AD’s global editorial director Amy Astley over email. “We at AD use the word to convey strategies that prioritize longevity, whether looking at a building, a community, or our planet, and make great efforts to clarify the ways in which a project strives to be sustainable.”Among the buildings highlighted is the Reggio School, an education facility in Madrid which managed to reduce its material usage by 48% after Spanish architect Andrés Jaque embraced the structure’s exposed mechanical systems and bare interior walls. Outside, 80% of the school’s facade is wrapped in cork — a natural material that encourages biodiversity. “The irregular surface of the cork projection is designed to allow organic material to accumulate. The envelope of the building will eventually become the habitat of numerous forms of microbiological fungi, vegetal and animal life,” read a press release from Jaque’s architecture firm.“The building will live as a constant transformation,”  added Maite Sebastia, AD head of editorial content in Spain, over email.Designed by renowned architect Bjarke Ingels, the Plus, a new factory for Norwegian furniture brand Vestre, has become the first industrial building to receive an “Outstanding” BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) rating. The BREEAM measuring system rates buildings’ environmental performance; according to Ingels, the factory releases 50% less greenhouse gasses than comparable facilities. With an almost ecclesiastical floor plan, the building’s four wings extend into a 300-acre public park designed to entice employees and visitors alike to enjoy nature. “You can make the world cleaner and more fun at the same stroke,” Ingels told AD.And a public pool in Lagos, Nigeria was also applauded as an important urban regenerative project. First built in 1928 with funding from doctor and philanthropist John Randle, the Art Deco facility had sat empty since the 1970s.  Now, though, the vibrant red and yellow building has been given a new lease of life by Lagos-based architecture firm SI.SA, and is set to reopen this summer as the new John Randle Centre for Yoruba Culture & History.“It is an impossible task to capture the latest sustainability news in a single article,” wrote AD global features director, Sam Cochran, in an email. “The takeaway, ultimately, is that every decision we make, and in particular every decision regarding the built environment, has an impact. But knowing that trade offs are inevitable, how can we do better?”Top image: A vibrant Art Deco public pool in Lagos, Nigeria is being regenerated by local architecture firm SI.SA.",style,0.0

Its 12.8 acres sold that year for £959 million ($1.2 billion) to the development company Qatari Diar in one of the priciest residential real estate deals in the world. The site now includes nearly 450 residences built in several phases; properties currently up for sale include a £5.7 million two-bedroom residence and a £55 million townhouse. Surrounding the homes’ white limestone and iron exteriors are public gardens, which make up 40% of the site’s grounds, according to Richard Oakes, who leads sales and marketing at Qatari Diar.“We took inspiration from the formal Georgian(-era) squares of Belgravia and positioned all of the townhouses and residential buildings around a series of landscaped public gardens and spaces, ensuring the development is accessible to the local community and evolves as a natural addition to Belgravia,” Oakes said over email. He called the project “a historic collaboration between the best master planners and creative minds in architecture and design.”Designed by PDP London and interiors studio Albion Nord, the new six-story townhouse spans nearly 15,000 square feet and features eight bedrooms, a gym, 39-foot-long swimming pool, spa, rooftop terrace and film screening room.Below ground, subterranean pathways connect the property to private parking and Chelsea Barracks’ shared amenities building, the Garrison Club — which includes more pools, a gym, and leisure areas. A separate two-floor residence is also accessible via a private garden for welcoming and housing guests.Oakes said the design team opted for a modern take on architecture from the 18th and early 19th-century Georgian period, which follows classical proportions and symmetry.“We were able to add all modern touches and features, without compromising the townhouse’s design or exterior architecture,” he said. The materials include “elegant and understated” materials such as English timber herringbone and marble, brass hardware, and metalwork balconies inspired by the late 19th-century Arts and Crafts movement, he added.Preserving the barracks’ architectural spirit has been fundamental to the project, Oakes said.“As we set out to design an entirely new neighborhood that connects seamlessly with Belgravia and is open and accessible, we still wanted to remember and celebrate the site’s history,” he explained. “Thanks to many years of thoughtful planning, design and construction, I believe we’ve succeeded in doing that.”",style,0.0

399,423,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/title-42-ending-whats-next-explainer-cec/index.html,"What is Title 42, why is it ending and what’s happening now at the border?",2023-05-11 23:43:00,"The end of a controversial border policy is looming.Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restrictions that became a key tool officials used to turn back migrants at the US-Mexico border, is set to expire on May 11.Here are answers to some key questions about Title 42, what’s happening on the ground and what could happen next.In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The order allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants at US land borders. The policy is widely known as Title 42, for the portion of US code that allowed the CDC director to issue it.Migrants encountered under Title 42 have been either returned to their home countries or sent back into Mexico. Under the policy, authorities have expelled migrants at the US-Mexico border more than 2.8 million times since the policy began, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.The policy, which officials have relied on to manage a spiraling situation at the border, is set to end at 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday.We’ve known for months that Title 42’s days were numbered.The policy’s end comes as the Biden administration is ending the Covid public health emergency nationally.The emergency declaration was the legal underpinning for Title 42’s border restrictions, in addition to a number of other policies.Officials predict that lifting Title 42 is likely to spur a significant increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US.One reason for the expected spike: Many migrants who were sent back to Mexico under the policy are desperate and losing patience.Advocates say for many of those who were expelled under Title 42, the situation has been dire.Since Biden took office, Human Rights First says it’s identified more than 13,000 incidents of kidnapping, torture, rape or other violent attacks on people blocked or expelled to Mexico under Title 42.Another reason for an expected surge in migrant crossings, according to officials, is misinformation from smugglers who exploit migrants for financial gain.Speaking to reporters last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urged would-be migrants not to fall victim to those efforts.“You are being deceived, and you are risking your lives and your life savings, only to meet a consequence that you do not expect at our southern border,” he said.“The border is not open, it has not been open, and it will not be open subsequent to May 11,” he said.Without Title 42 in place, US immigration authorities will return to decades-old protocols at a time of unprecedented mass migration in the Western hemisphere.Under that system, migrants are either removed from the country, detained or released into the US while their cases make their way through immigration court.But the Biden administration is also planning several changes that authorities hope will relieve pressure on the border and help officials respond.The Department of Homeland Security previously released a six-pillar plan that outlined the department’s operations post-Title 42, including setting up additional facilities along the border to process migrants, bolstering transportation and leaning on a fast-track deportation process known as “expedited removal.” Administration officials are still relying on that plan.In addition, a new regulation expected to go into effect this week would largely ban migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the US-Mexico border from applying for asylum in the United States.While there are some exceptions, the new asylum rule would generally apply to migrants who unlawfully cross the US-Mexico border. It would not apply to unaccompanied migrant children.The planned asylum restrictions have drawn sharp criticism from immigrant rights advocates since they were proposed earlier this year and are likely to face legal challenges.The administration is also sending an additional 1,500 active-duty troops to the border and leaning on Mexico to help stem migration in part by allowing the US to send certain migrants who aren’t Mexican back across the border.“We’ve been preparing for quite some time, and we are ready,” Mayorkas said last week, but he also acknowledged that large numbers of migrants are expected at the border.Politicians on both sides of the aisle and local officials have expressed skepticism that the administration truly is prepared to handle the crisis. Already the number of migrants crossing the border appears to be on the rise, and detention facilities have reached capacity.In a news conference Monday morning, Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott likened the expiration of Title 42 as the laying out of a welcome mat to migrants across the world, signaling America’s borders are wide open.“It will lead to an incredible amount of people coming across the border illegally,” Abbott said, adding the administration’s policies would “cause a catastrophic disaster.”The Title 42 border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them. Immigrant rights advocates argued officials were using public health as a pretext to keep as many immigrants out of the country as possible. Public health experts also slammed the policy, saying it wasn’t justified by the circumstances.And last year a federal judge sided with them, calling the policy “arbitrary and capricious.”Republican-led states launched a round of legal challenges after the Biden administration first announced plans to end the policy. And the Supreme Court had said it would weigh in after an emergency appeal.But US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that case was rendered moot once the administration announced its plans to end the Covid public health emergency. And soon afterward, the Supreme Court removed the case from its calendar.Additional legal challenges to other administration policies have been filed to coincide with the end of Title 42.A federal judge in Florida temporarily blocked the Biden administration from releasing migrants from Border Patrol custody without court notices. The ruling takes effect Thursday at 11:59 p.m. ET and will expire in 14 days, according to a late court filing.The Biden administration is expected to appeal, but for now, the ruling takes away one of the administration’s key tools to try to manage the number of migrants in US Customs and Border Protection custody – in some cases, by releasing them from custody with conditions. US border facilities are not equipped to hold people for extended periods of time.Some communities are already dealing with an influx of migrants.Brownsville, Texas, began seeing a spike about a week and a half ago, according to Sergio Cordova, a founder of the non-profit organization Team Brownsville.The organization has been receiving about 1,000 migrants a day at its center, Cordova said. And while many quickly move on to their next destinations, dozens have slept on the streets over the last week.El Paso, which declared a state of emergency ahead of Title 42’s expiration, already has about 2,300 migrants living on the streets around two shelters downtown, and some aid organizations worry they won’t have the resources to help everyone if that number grows.“We’re still able to feed them, but in all honesty, that’s not (a) sustainable operation at this point,” John Martin, deputy director of the Opportunity Center for the Homeless in El Paso, Texas, told CNN on Sunday.“This is a national issue,” Martin said. “We in El Paso, along with many other communities along the southern border, just happened to be at the front doorstep.”Concern over Title 42’s end isn’t limited to border states. The issue has become a lightning rod nationally, particularly in cities that have in recent months become the targets for Republican governors and officials in Southern states sending buses of migrants elsewhere.New York Mayor Eric Adams has been vocal in his calls for more aid, saying the migrant arrivals in his city and others in the Northeast should be handled by the federal government. The financial burden, he said recently, is also taking a toll on the city, which on Friday was awarded $30.5 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in humanitarian aid – a fraction of the $350 million the city asked for.With the 2024 presidential election looming, whatever happens next at the border is sure to face intense scrutiny on the national political stage.Already lawmakers in Washington are sparring over how to respond.",politics,0.0

The change would require a constitutional amendment, making its enactment unlikely.Ramaswamy, a biotech founder, entered the race in February and has used his wealth to fund his bid and aggressively campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina – states that will be key to securing the GOP nomination. He said he would provide the “rationale and detail” for his voting proposal during his Thursday night rally in Urbandale, Iowa.“Our military currently suffers a 25% recruitment deficit, and only 16 percent of Gen Z say they’re proud to be American. The absence of national pride is a serious threat to the future of our country,” Ramaswamy said in a statement released by his campaign. “We must think ambitiously about reviving civic duty in America.”The 26th Amendment, ratified in 1971, lowered the voting age from 21 down to 18, although some states let people who are 17 vote in primaries if they’ll be 18 on Election Day.Politico first reported that Ramaswamy was planning to announce this new proposal, despite his staff objecting to the idea.He has pitched himself as an outsider, having never held political office, and the candidate to take Donald Trump’s “America First” policy further than the former Republican president. Among his other proposals, he has floated shutting down federal agencies such as the Education Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In his campaign speeches, he’s lamented over what he has described as a “national identity crisis” and has argued that the US needs to unite around its basic ideals of meritocracy, rule of law and free speech.“Civic Duty Voting can create a sense of shared purpose and responsibility amongst young Americans to become educated citizens,” he said in the Thursday statement.",politics,0.0

She has focused on key foreign policy objectives and challenges, including the US-China relationship.Sherman often took on some of the tougher diplomatic duties. In February, Sherman and Secretary Antony Blinken summoned China’s top official in Washington to the State Department and delivered “a very clear and stark message” about the discovery of a Chinese surveillance balloon, officials told CNN at the time.Her replacement is unknown at this time, the sources said.The Senate confirmed Sherman as deputy secretary of State in April 2021. She was the first woman to hold the position.“She leaves incredibly big shoes to fill,” said one of the US officials familiar with the matter.Sherman also came into the role with deep foreign policy expertise, having served as the chief negotiator with Iran, which led to the Iran nuclear deal during the Obama administration. In addition to covering many other consequential portfolios, she was a key player on North Korea policy during the Clinton administration.The expected change comes as the department is facing other personnel movements. The administration is preparing to nominate James O’Brien as the assistant secretary for European affairs. O’Brien is currently serving as the top sanctions official at the department, playing a central role in developing the sanctions regime targeting Russia after the country invaded Ukraine last year.The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",politics,0.0

Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Thursday that exempts records related to his travel from the state’s robust public disclosure law.Under the new law, law enforcement agencies would be barred from sharing any records related to the governor’s security and travel, as well as “for persons for whom such services are requested by the governor.” The expansive language could allow the DeSantis administration to keep secret trips arranged by the governor’s office even when he wasn’t involved.The law comes on the heels of the governor’s recent trips to key primary states and Israel, and critics have slammed the legislation as an attempt to keep damaging information about DeSantis’ travel from getting out just as he is expected to announce a campaign for president.However, Republicans said the measure was necessary to protect DeSantis and prevent details about his travel habits and security detail from falling into the hands of people who might be plotting an attack on the governor. Asked about the measure last week, DeSantis said it wasn’t his idea.The law applies retroactively and would cover his extensive use of state planes throughout his time as governor. It would also cover records related to visitors to the governor’s mansion, opponents said.Such information has long been public record in Florida, a state where public access to state records and meetings is enshrined in its constitution, and it has at times led to uncomfortable disclosures about Florida governors.The bill was one of 37 that DeSantis signed into law on Thursday, including a ban on schools and businesses from requiring masks or vaccinations against Covid-19 just as the federal public health emergency was about to expire.The ban is a continuation of his policies – which were first passed in November 2021 and set to expire at the end of June – that eschewed medical experts throughout the pandemic.Speaking to a friendly crowd in the deeply red Panhandle, DeSantis touted how Florida reopened its economy and schools ahead of most states and fought mandates for workers to get vaccinated.“Florida did it right and those states did it wrong,” DeSantis said.",politics,0.0

George Santos induced to donate money as part of an alleged scheme that diverted purported political contributions to Santos’ personal use, Intrater’s lawyer confirmed to CNN on Thursday.In a 13-count indictment made public Wednesday, prosecutors alleged that Santos and an unnamed associate duped two donors – described only as Contributor #1 and Contributor #2 – into giving $25,000 apiece to support the Republican’s candidacy last year.The donors were told the money would go to an independent committee that could raise unlimited amounts to help his campaign and would help underwrite television ads, according to the indictment. Prosecutors, however, say the money instead went to a limited liability company that Santos controlled and the funds paid for designer clothing, credit cards bills and other personal expenses.“From the outset, Andy Intrater aided the government’s investigation of George Santos and is identified as a victim in the Indictment as Contributor #2,” Intrater’s lawyer, Richard D. Owens, said in a statement. “Andy is gratified that Santos will now have to answer in court for the many lies George told to Andy and so many other Americans.”Santos pleaded not guilty Wednesday in New York and has vowed to fight the charges.Intrater has financially supported Santos’ political ambitions in recent years, donating more than $24,000 to Santos’ congressional campaigns and his federal leadership PAC since 2020, Federal Election Commission records show.Intrater told The New York Times earlier this year that he also had invested more than $600,000 in a fund offered by Harbor City Capital, where Santos worked as an account manager, partly because he admired Santos as a “hard-working guy.”Intrater told the paper he later discovered he had been misled.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in April 2021 against Harbor City and its founder, Jonathan P. Maroney, alleging the company ran a $17 million “Ponzi scheme.” Maroney has not been charged with a crime, and Santos is not named in the SEC complaint.Intrater is perhaps best known in US political circles as a cousin of Viktor Vekselberg, one of several Russian oligarchs sanctioned in 2018 by the US Treasury Department, for “worldwide malign activity.”The New York Times earlier reported that Intrater was Contributor #2 in the indictment. CNN has not confirmed the identity of the other contributor described in the indictment.",politics,0.0

We’ve already made specific recommendations to each side to take actions and some of that is happening,” the official told reporters on a call.A ceasefire monitoring mechanism has been developed to “help hold the parties accountable to what they’ve agreed to do,” the official said.The declaration, the name of which was “requested by the parties to emphasize that they’re interested in trying to help the civilians who are suffering from this fighting,” was signed following days of “pre-negotiation talks” which have been mediated by the United States and Saudi Arabia.Those talks began this weekend in Jeddah, weeks after the outbreak of fighting in Sudan that has left hundreds dead and thousands injured, caused tens of thousands to flee their homes and left the country on the brink of civil war and a massive humanitarian catastrophe.A second senior State Department official said that it took longer than expected to get an agreement on the declaration, and “the negotiations were very tough,” particularly given “the depth of enmity” between the RSF and the SAF.The first official said that the SAF and RSF negotiators “with the support of the Saudi and American mediators,” will now “begin to negotiate an actual short term ceasefire.”The goal is to reach a ceasefire of up to 10 days, they said, “but we’ll have to see what’s possible to facilitate those activities.”A ceasefire monitoring mechanism, which will be supported by the United Nations, Saudi Arabia, the US, “and other members of the international community,” has been developed. The second official said the mechanism includes “overhead imagery, including satellite data,” social media analysis, and on the ground reporting from Sudanese civil society members.The official noted that “we’ve seen violations by both sides in all the ceasefires to date and don’t expect that to change.”They said they intend to establish a committee that the ceasefire monitoring mechanism would report to, which would include representatives from the RSF, SAF, and international community. Asked about punitive measures, the official said that “the biggest one here would frankly be public attribution where possible,” which would help combat propaganda and misinformation about who was responsible for the violations.The first official noted that this was just the initial phase of talks, telling reporters, “this is going to be a process so we are just at the first stage.”“We did this in partnership with the Saudis, at the request of the two sides,” the first official said of the talks in Jeddah. “The two sides asked us to help them out with this, but there is every expectation that this process will be expanded to include, first and most importantly, Sudanese civilians, and secondly, regional partners in Africa and in the Arab world, and then the international community.”",politics,0.0

Tommy Tuberville was asked if he believes White nationalists should be allowed in the military. He responded, “I call them Americans.”Tuberville is now attempting to clarify his comments, arguing that Trump Republicans in the military are being unfairly characterized as White nationalists.The radio station WBHM published a transcript of the interview with Tuberville where he was asked, “Do you believe they should allow White nationalists in the military?”The senator responded, “Well, they call them that. I call them Americans. What happened after January the sixth—and I was here on January the sixth—we were attacked on the Senate floor. Saying all these people that came into the Capitol were extremists, they were against the country. There was a lot of people. There were probably a hundred of them that came in, broke windows and broke doors that should have been locked up. That’s not how we do it in America.”Tuberville later attempted to clarify his response, telling CNN on Thursday that “Democrats” say MAGA Republicans are White nationalists, and MAGA Republicans should not be characterized that way.“Here’s the problem, Democrats portray all MAGA Republicans as White nationalists, that’s not true, we got a lot of great people in the military that are MAGAs, that’s what I was talking about ” he said.Later, talking to a group of reporters, Tuberville said that he “looks at” White nationalism as being equated with Trump Republicans, because “that’s what we’re called all the time.”“I look at a White nationalist as a, as a Trump Republican. That’s what we’re called all the time, a MAGA person, that’s what I’m just that. Well, I agree that we should not be characterizing Trump supporters as White nationalists,” the Alabama Republican said.This comes as Tuberville has continued to put a hold on confirming military nominees over his anger at a Pentagon post-Roe policy that allows members of the military paid leave if they need to travel in order to have an abortion.For weeks, Senate Democrats have criticized the effort by Tuberville and top defense officials have said that it is harming US national security as key senior positions are not permanently filled.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday called on Tuberville to denounce White nationalism as “un-American,” and stop his hold on military nominations.“Senator Tuberville, needs to do two things. He needs to come out and state clearly and unequivocally that White nationalism is un-American and he needs to drop his destructive holds on hundreds of our senior military leaders. This farse is endangering our national security, putting the lives of men and women who have served our country for decades in real trouble, and it needs to end,” Schumer said.",politics,0.0
406,430,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/federal-handgun-ban-18-20-year-olds/index.html,"Federal ban on selling handguns to 18- to 20-year-olds is unconstitutional, judge says",2023-05-11 18:53:00,"A federal judge said Wednesday that federal prohibitions on licensed dealers selling handguns to 18- to 20-year-olds are unconstitutional, in what is the latest legal volley over age-based firearm regulations – a court fight that has escalated since the Supreme Court’s major Second Amendment ruling last year.US District Judge Robert Payne of the Eastern District of Virginia said that under the test laid out in the Supreme Court’s recent ruling, the federal regulation runs afoul of the Second Amendment.“Because the statutes and regulations in question are not consistent with our Nation’s history and tradition, they, therefore, cannot stand,” he wrote, referencing the Supreme Court ruling’s instruction that lower courts look to the gun regulations that were in effect during the Constitution’s framing to decide whether a current gun law violates the Second Amendment.The Justice Department declined to comment. But its attorneys have the option to ask that Payne’s ruling be paused for it to be appealed. There are also procedural questions about the case that must be settled before Payne issues a mandate that puts the ruling into effect.In his opinion, Payne concluded that 18-to 21-year-olds were part of the American political community – citing the age group’s ability to vote and enlist in the military – and thus the age group fell under the Second Amendment’s protections.“If the Court were to exclude 18-to-21-year-olds from the Second Amendment’s protection, it would impose limitations on the Second Amendment that do not exist from other constitutional guarantees,” Payne, a George H. W. Bush-appointee, wrote.He then turned to the second part of the Supreme Court’s test, where the high court said that a regulation could only be upheld if analogous regulations existed at the time of the framing.“The Government has not presented any evidence of age-based restrictions on the purchase or sale of firearms from the colonial era, Founding, or Early Republic,” Payne said.He later concluded that the “lack of analogous regulations permits a finding that the Founders considered age-based regulations on the purchase of firearms to circumscribe the right to keep and bear arms confirmed by the Second Amendment.”Even before the 2022 Supreme Court’s ruling, known as New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the constitutionality of gun restrictions for older teenagers was a flashpoint of firearm litigation and federal courts have taken different approaches to the question. Those in favor of gun safety laws have pointed to the prevalence of mass shootings perpetrated by shooters in their late teens, while opponents of gun restrictions for 18-to-20-year-olds have argued that teenage participation in militias at the timing of the founding puts the constitutionality of such laws in questions.Last year’s Bruen opinion – authored by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by the high court’s other GOP-appointees – put these legal battles on overdrive. The new opinion from Payne hints at what could be a major dispute that the Supreme Court must ultimately resolve.In March, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Florida law – passed after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School – that raised the minimum age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21. (Federal trial courts in Virginia sit under the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, and as such are not bound by 11th Circuit precedents.) In concluding the Florida ban was constitutional, the 11th Circuit opinion pointed to similar restrictions that were in place in the mid-1800s, around the time of the ratification of the 14th Amendment, which extended the Second Amendment’s protections to states.Payne acknowledged Wednesday he was taking a different approach than that of the 11th Circuit. He noted because his case concerned a federal restriction rather than a state law, he was looking at the gun regulations in place at the country’s founding, in the late 18th century, when the Second Amendment was adopted. Whether the 11th Circuit had a “sound” rationale in relying instead on Reconstruction-era regulations “will be tested on appeal,” Payne said in a footnote.In an earlier case, the 4th Circuit said in 2021 that the federal regulations setting a minimum age of 21 years old for purchasing handguns from licensed dealers violated the Second Amendment. However, after the challengers in that case turned 21, the appeals court ruled that the lawsuit was moot and vacated that opinion.To get around that issue, the challengers in the latest lawsuit are seeking class certification. The judge has asked for the parties to weigh in next week on how to move forward with that question.Elliott Harding, a lawyer for the challengers, said in a statement that they were “pleased” the court ruled in their favor Wednesday “in such a well-written and thorough decision.”“Even though it ensures that future buyers can now purchase these firearms in the federal system, one that includes background checks and other requirements, we expect that the defendants will appeal,” the statement said, alluding to the unregulated, private market that older teenagers currently use to purchase handguns. “Nevertheless, we remain optimistic the decision will be affirmed in due course.”",politics,0.0

Trump said he thinks that Russian President Vladimir “Putin made a mistake” by invading Ukraine, but he stopped short of saying that Putin is a war criminal.That’s something that “should be discussed later,” Trump said.Sen. Todd Young of Indiana told CNN’s Manu Raju that he thinks “President Trump’s judgment is wrong in this case” when asked about the comments on the war and Putin.Young added that “of course it does” worry him. “That’s why I don’t intend to support him for the Republican nomination.”Asked why he won’t support Trump, Young said: “Where do I begin?”Later, Young told CNN, “I’ll be supporting about anybody but him.”Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told Raju that Putin is “probably” a war criminal when asked about Trump’s town hall comments.The former president also said he would pardon “a large portion” of the rioters at the US Capitol on January 6. “I am inclined to pardon many of them,” Trump said Wednesday night.Asked about Trump’s comments about pardoning January 6 rioters, Hawley said, “If you’re asking me do I think we should pardon people who engaged in rioting behavior? No.”Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told Raju that, “anybody who crossed into the Capitol (on January 6) under the circumstances that I witnessed first hand, it’s hard for me to have a positive predisposition towards them.”Trump also suggested at the town hall that Republicans should refuse to raise the debt limit if the White House does not agree to spending cuts – and suggested that if there are not major cuts then there will have to be a default.“I say to the Republicans out there – congressmen, senators – if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default,” Trump said, adding, “I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave.”When asked to clarify whether the US should default if the White House doesn’t agree to cuts, Trump said, “We might as well do it now than do it later.”Asked about the suggestion that maybe the nation should default, Hawley said, “That’s not going to happen.”",politics,0.0

That includes both President Joe Biden, who staked his legacy as a defender of democratic principles in the US and abroad on Ukraine’s survival, and Putin, who presided over a scaled-down Victory Day parade in Moscow this week after failing in his war aim of crushing Ukraine’s sovereignty.Battlefield developments could dictate the course of the war long before the November 2024 election. And making equivocal judgments about any comments the ex-president makes is risky, since he often seems to live day-by-day and minute-by-minute rather than following months-long strategic blueprints.Nevertheless, Trump’s unwillingness to refer to Putin as a war criminal despite evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine and an International Criminal Court warrant for his arrest renewed intrigue over the ex-president’s motives in repeatedly genuflecting to the Kremlin strongman.Yet Trump’s personal and political motivations for creating a campaign issue out of Ukraine, and his capacity for politicizing the multi-billion dollar US lifeline of weapons and ammunition for Zelensky’s government should not be underestimated. In New Hampshire, Trump showed that he views the war as a perfect vehicle for his populist nationalism, claiming that the rest of the world is ripping the US off and that Biden is more concerned with protecting the security of foreigners than the economic needs of Americans.This message could be especially powerful in the event of any recession next year that could hurt Biden’s reelection bid. It’s also unclear whether Biden would want to enter the critical months of his campaign still sending billions of dollars in Ukraine despite highlighting his leadership of the West as a major foreign policy success.For now, the prospect of a Trump return to office is a long-term concern for Ukraine, as it fights to eject Russian forces from its territory in a long-awaited counter-attack and relies on the staunch support of Biden who has reinvigorated the Western alliance in its support. After all, the next election is 18 months away and Trump may not win the GOP nomination or the presidential contest. Some recent polls have detected a softening of support for the prominent US role in supporting Ukraine – especially among Republicans – a factor Trump is trying to exploit, although GOP support for Ukraine in Congress remains firm despite high-profile anti-Zelensky rhetoric from some of his closest allies on Capitol Hill.For Trump, the entire question of Ukraine boils down to a dollars and cents equation – much as he appeared to view NATO while in office as little more than an international protection racket.“We’re giving away so much equipment, we don’t have ammunition for ourselves right now,” the ex-president said at the CNN town hall. And, he added, “we don’t have ammunition for ourselves we’re giving away so much” – comments that tapped into a seam of isolationism in the modern-day Republican Party.When he was asked by CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins whether he believes Putin should stand trial for alleged war crimes, Trump replied: “I’ll say this: I want Europe to put up more money.” That comment paralleled one of the most enduring applause lines of his 2016 campaign in which he accused US allies, like those in Europe and in Asia, of enriching themselves under a US defense umbrella.On one hand, Trump’s comments are an affront to generations of US foreign policy orthodoxy based on the idea that making the world safe for democracy and standing up to tyrants is in core US political, diplomatic and commercial interests and is a multiplier of American power.Yet his threats toward US allies, especially in Europe, while sending shock waves through the transatlantic alliance, did result in some European powers increasing their own defense spending toward NATO’s recommended 2% of GDP threshold for member states. It is sometimes difficult however to distinguish between the Trump effect and more European defense spending because of a growing concerns about Russia – even before the Ukraine invasion.But Trump is also correct that the US has spent more in Ukraine’s defense than the EU – a mighty economy – that is geographically far closer to the war zone than the United States. The Biden administration has committed a total of $36.9 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war in an extraordinary effort that has effectively made it a de-facto NATO client and effectively thwarted one of Putin’s war aims in keeping Kyiv out the Western orbit.European Union institutions have pledged about 3.6 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine, but individual member states have given over 10 billion euros more in combined contributions, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Britain – no longer an EU member – has additionally sent more than 6 billion euros’ worth and, as CNN’s Jim Sciutto exclusively reported on Thursday, has delivered “Storm Shadow” cruise missiles to Zelensky’s forces ahead of the coming offensive. (One dollar is currently equivalent to 0.91 euros.)Like the United States, Europe has also offered tens of billions of dollars in other kinds of aid, grants and loan guarantees to Ukraine but Washington remains the top donor. Trump’s transactional view of the Western alliance reflects his very narrow view of US security interests and foreign policy, which has not changed since his first term in office, when he cut US financial contributions to NATO.It also ignores the way the combined US-Europe partnership rooted in American military might has not only largely kept the peace in Europe for nearly 80 years but has made the Western bloc the most prosperous and democratic political experiment in history. His first administration turned the US from a guarantor of global stability into a major disruptive force – and he’s already signaling a second one would deliver more of the same.But his complaints about European defense spending did get support from an unlikely source on Thursday: EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell.“I was not a fan of President Trump, but I think he was right in one thing – Europeans doesn’t share their part of the burden,” Borrell said in Brussels on Thursday.Still, Ukraine should probably be worried that if Trump returns to power he would relish obliterating Biden’s legacy, in the same way that he pulled out of the Paris climate accord and trashed the Iran nuclear deal – diplomatic centerpieces of the Obama administration.And the ex-president may harbor particular resentment toward Zelensky after his attempt to get the Ukrainian president to announce a corruption investigation against Biden ahead of the 2020 election led to his first impeachment.New Hampshire’s Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, a frequent Trump critic and potential 2024 presidential candidate, described Trump’s town hall performance as “weak,” “wimpy” and lacking leadership in an appearance on the “Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.”“Ukraine has to win the war,” Sununu said, adding that the US had never had a better chance to “put our foot down on that tin can army of Russia.”Trump’s former defense secretary, Mark Esper, told CNN “This Morning” on Thursday that Trump’s comments sent the “wrong message” not least because they could suggest to China that it could wait out the determination of the US and its allies to deter any invasion of Taiwan.America’s friends abroad however stressed on Thursday that for now at least, Trump’s intentions for Ukraine were hypothetical.Zelensky himself shrugged off Trump’s comments in an interview with European public broadcasters.“Who knows where we’ll be [when the election happens]?” he said, according to the BBC. “I believe we’ll win by then.”And British Defense Secretary of State for Defense Ben Wallace said in the House of Commons on Thursday that he was confident that Americans would support Ukraine whoever was in the White House.“The US President today is President Biden. I have a good relationship with him, as do the Government,” said Wallace. “I know that the decent and good people of America would recognize that their rights are just as important as those of the people of Ukraine. Their Constitution upholds rights. I think that is what will unite them, and I am confident that whoever comes next as president will continue to support the battle to uphold human rights.”But this week has been the clearest reminder yet that Trump, who last year called for the “termination” of the Constitution, may not share those values.",politics,0.0
409,433,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/donald-trump-polls/index.html,Trump’s primary polling advantage is historically large,2023-05-11 17:02:00,"With Wednesday’s CNN town hall behind him, former President Donald Trump remains both the prohibitive GOP front-runner for the 2024 nomination and a man who was found liable this week in a civil case for sexually abusing and defaming former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.While we cannot yet know what effect that verdict will have on the race for the Republican nomination, Trump built his large polling advantage with this civil trial in the news and after being indicted earlier this spring in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. (Trump has denied all wrongdoing.)Trump’s edge in surveys of Republican voters and in endorsements from elected officials at this stage is among the strongest for a nonincumbent in the modern presidential primary era.Trump is polling, on average, north of 50% in national polls of likely GOP primary voters. His nearest potential challenger – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to launch a campaign – is earning a little north of 20% of the Republican primary vote on average. No other potential Republican candidate is in double digits.There are very few candidates, from either party, in nonincumbent races who were near or north of 50% in the national primary polls this early on. That select few includes Republicans Bob Dole in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000, and Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of those candidates won their party’s nominations, and none of those races were particularly close.Interestingly, all the legal controversies involving Trump have not hurt him in the polls. At the beginning of the year, Trump was earning a little more than 40% of the vote, on average, and was only about 10 points ahead of DeSantis. Trump’s lead is now triple that, at closer to 30 points, on average.The advantages that DeSantis once had have similarly melted away. For example, in New Hampshire – where Wednesday’s town hall took place – DeSantis was up by 12 points over Trump at the beginning of the year, according to University of New Hampshire polling. Trump has now opened up a 20-point advantage in the latest UNH survey among likely GOP primary voters.Of course, if it was solely the polls where Trump was ahead, that might be one thing. Polling isn’t always predictive, and there could be some underlying dynamic that could shift it. But the other big factor working in Trump’s favor is that many elected Republicans are behind him.Trump has the endorsements of well more than 60 GOP governors and members of Congress. None of the Republicans running or thinking of running even come close to double digits in endorsements from elected officials of that level.The importance of endorsements should not be understated. The party apparatus uniting behind one candidate can often be key in turning a race around. On the Democratic side in 2020, for example, Joe Biden was lifted when his former rivals endorsed him ahead of Super Tuesday.The failure of the GOP establishment to back a single Trump alternative in 2016 was part of the reason he was able to win the nomination. Elected Republican officials were split on whom they wanted to be the nominee, and Trump was able to take advantage of this divided field.This time around, that option of the establishment rallying to a non-Trump candidate isn’t available to the same degree. Since 1980, anyone who had a similar share of endorsements as Trump does at this point in the nomination process has gone on to win their party’s nomination.The 1980 Democratic presidential primary might give us a clue. It remains the only time in modern history in which a nonincumbent (Sen. Ted Kennedy) was polling north of 45% at this point and didn’t go on to be his party’s nominee.Kennedy’s bid was overtaken by events on the ground. Specifically, then-President Jimmy Carter rallied back to win the Democratic nomination following the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis. A once clear lead for Kennedy became a large Carter advantage basically overnight.The crucial difference here is that there isn’t an incumbent in the 2024 Republican race. Still, there are a lot of potential events involving Trump.We don’t know how Republicans will react to his loss in civil court, which Trump has said he will appeal. We don’t know what will happen if he is convicted in a possible criminal trial related to the hush money payments. (After being charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in that case, he’s trying to move it to federal court.) We don’t know what will happen if he is indicted in other cases around the country related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, his conduct in the run-up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and his handling of classified documents.Perhaps the biggest unknown is how Republican voters will react if DeSantis actually gets into the race. It’s possible voters will look at him differently if and when he truly starts campaigning.For now, though, Trump remains well ahead. It will take something big to knock him off his perch at the top of the Republican polls.This story has been updated.",politics,0.0
410,434,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/hunter-biden-investigations-what-matters/index.html,The Hunter Biden scandal vortex is growing again,2023-05-11 12:09:00,"The allegations against Hunter Biden have been generally consistent for years, dating back to when then-President Donald Trump dispatched his political bagman Rudy Giuliani to dig up dirt around the time Joe Biden announced his run for the White House in 2019.The basic outline is this: Hunter Biden, while he was in the throes of a drug addiction that broke up his family, made millions of dollars from foreign companies because his last name is Biden.While the basic storyline hasn’t changed, there is an evolving series of disclosures, investigations and legal problems facing the president’s son and causing grief for the president as the latter tries to convince Americans he deserves four more years.Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell, who also at one time represented Trump’s daughter Ivanka, dismissed the new details as “retread, repackaged misstatements of perfectly proper meetings and business by private citizens.”While it’s true that there have been no criminal charges or allegations, even from Republicans, of something illegal, it’s also true that none of these developments sound good:►House Republicans are filling in some unflattering details about Hunter Biden’s substantial income from foreign sources in the period before his father ran for president.►Attorneys for an IRS whistleblower who allege there is political interference at the Justice Department in the Hunter Biden criminal investigation met with congressional investigators last week.►An Arkansas paternity-related case has the potential to fill in details about income from his art career and help from wealthy friends in the period since his father became president. Hunter Biden has asked for his $20,000 per month child support payments to be lowered.►A long-simmering federal criminal investigation could cause even more problems for the president’s son if prosecutors ultimately decide to bring charges against him, potentially over alleged tax violations and making a false statement relating to a gun he bought. The investigation has examined the foreign business dealings that the GOP is focused on. But investigators and prosecutors have had trouble corroborating many of the claims and have focused their probe on Hunter Biden’s tax issues.►A new line of inquiry has to do with whether a sitting CIA employee interacted with former officials involved in an effort to downplay the discovery of a laptop tied to Hunter Biden and publicized before the 2020 election. Hunter himself is not implicated in that inquiry, but it is certainly part of the larger set of inquiries that stem from the president’s son.What no investigation has yet proven is any corruption related to the president and his son or any direct connection to the president at all – although Republicans also allege there is paperwork regarding an interview conducted by the FBI with a mysterious witness Republicans are calling a whistleblower making allegations about Joe Biden during his time as vice president.The FBI on Wednesday refused to provide the document, arguing that “unverified or incomplete information” could “harm investigations, prejudice prosecutions or judicial proceedings, unfairly violate privacy or reputational interests, or create misimpressions in the public.”Even if there’s no direct evidence of corruption, the money flowing to Hunter Biden, his uncle James and even his brother Beau’s widow Hallie, with whom Hunter also had a relationship, does not paint a pretty picture.They were paid millions through a series of companies, according to a new report, the second by the House Oversight Committee delving into the issue.The report is being used by Republicans to allege that Hunter Biden, along with other Biden family members, turned the family name into a calling card for work abroad.The committee presented redacted images of money transfers that it argues show how a company tied to a Romanian business executive, since convicted of corruption in his own country, paid a company tied to Hunter Biden’s business partner. That company, in turn, paid certain Biden family members.At a news conference announcing the new report, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said he views this as an investigation not just of Hunter or other Biden relatives.“I want to be clear,” Comer said. “This committee is investigating President Biden and his family’s shady business deals that capitalized on Joe Biden’s public office and risked our country’s national security.”In March, the committee detailed a similar arrangement, whereby a company with ties to Hunter Biden was paid by a Chinese company and then split the proceeds with Hunter Biden.Comer said Republicans will push for legislation to require new disclosure of financial arrangements for elected officials.A White House spokesman, Ian Sams, suggested Comer was only selectively releasing information and “spreading baseless innuendo.” He also noted there is no evidence of any influence on Biden or Obama administration policy.Opaque business deals invite suspicion, but it’s a little strange to see Republicans who defend Trump’s business, which is divided into scores of companies, now attack the Bidens.It is similarly hypocritical of Democrats who have attacked Trump to dismiss anything to do with Hunter Biden.Republicans have been hammering away at versions of the Hunter Biden storyline ever since 2019, sure that the scent of scandal attached to the president’s son will drag down his father.Trump survived his first impeachment after trying to pressure Ukraine’s president to investigate Biden.Republicans in the Senate, when they held the majority there, issued a report on Hunter Biden – although it alleged no specific corruption – just before the 2020 election.House Republicans, now that they have the majority, have taken up the baton.Senate Republicans failed to find direct evidence of corruption in the Bidens’ activity in Ukraine in that 2020 report, although it allowed them to repeat that Hunter Biden’s business career while his dad was vice president was awkward at best.Republicans see laziness or worse in the lack of federal charges against Hunter Biden for either tax evasion or his gun purchase, but that could also be because there’s not a sound case.Not much is known about the IRS whistleblower that wants to share their story with lawmakers. Almost nothing is known about the mysterious FBI interview House Republicans have demanded to hear about.“There’s not a single thing that I’ve observed at all that would affect me or the United States relative to my son Hunter,” Biden told “60 Minutes” last September. More recently, he told MSNBC last week, “My son has done nothing wrong. I trust him. I have faith in him. It impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him.”Now, as Trump and Biden prepare to run against each other (again) for the presidency, and with the focus on Hunter entering a new fever pitch, the question will be whether all the time and effort Republicans have invested investigating the president’s wayward son will change the storyline.",politics,0.0
411,435,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/trump-cnn-town-hall-analysis/index.html,Trump was untamed and untruthful in CNN’s town hall – and some of his fans love him even more,2023-05-11 08:56:00,"Former President Donald Trump offered America a throwback to past national angst and a possible future of even greater drama in a CNN town hall on Wednesday.It’s up to Republicans – and perhaps eventually the country as a whole – to decide whether it wants to go through it all over again.The former commander in chief and the frontrunner in the GOP primary showed in New Hampshire exactly why his Republican fans flock to his combativeness and refusal to submit to codes of presidential decorum and why he has had the GOP in his grip for years.But in outbursts of election denialism, untamed fury, misogynistic comments about a sexual assault case and by refusing to agree Russian President Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, he also showed why many in the GOP fear he could again alienate enough voters to hand the White House to Democrats in 2024.And he gave President Joe Biden an even wider opening to argue the country can’t bear a second Trump presidency.“I have the absolute right to do whatever I want with them,” Trump said of classified documents he hoarded at his Florida resort when he left office, although he might also have been referring to his wider belief that there should be no constraints on his power if he wins another term.But as horrifying as his demagoguery is to many, the reality of Trump’s strong lead in early primary polls is that millions of Republican voters don’t see this even more torqued version of the most disruptive president in American history as disqualifying.It is exactly what they want and why they love him. And if he eventually becomes the Republican nominee for the third time in a row, he has a chance to be the next president.“I like Trump and what he stood for and now, I like him more,” said Joanne Rouston, a former Democrat-turned-Trump voter who was in the audience. “It’s the fight.”Trump is attempting a comeback like none before. Not only is he seeking to become only the second president to win a non-consecutive term. He’s seeking to bounce back after a double impeachment and an attempt to taint American democracy after he lost his first reelection bid. He took the stage a day after a civil jury in New York found he sexually abused a woman in the 1990s and found him liable for battery and defamation. He was recently indicted in a criminal hush money investigation and pleaded not guilty. And the possibility that he could face more criminal charges for his attacks on democracy and hoarding of classified documents means he is stretching the nation’s legal institutions in an unprecedented way for a presidential candidate.The town hall marked pretty much the first time – at least outside a court room or under oath – that Trump was called publicly to account in person for his lies about the 2020 election and role in inciting a mob attack on Congress by his supporters. But he again refused to accept that he lost the last presidential election, despite multiple courts throwing out his challenges and the certifications of his own administration that there was not widespread fraud.And Trump previewed an even more troublesome posture toward America’s democratic values when he said he was inclined to pardon a “large portion” of the rioters who smashed their way into the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and beat up police officers.The tension and excitement that hung over bucolic Saint Anselm College, as an audience of Republicans and undeclared voters lined up serenaded by a big crowd’s anti-Trump chants, made clear that this was the true kickoff of the 2024 presidential race.Going into the event, Trump’s campaign team had signaled that it was not just targeting die-hard “Make America Great Again” voters, but other Republicans and even more moderate voters who were turned off by his behavior in the past but may give him another look.While Trump’s relentless refusal to concede a point and his insistence on his own, often false, version of events is popular among his fans, it’s hard to see how his appearance on Wednesday helped him expand his base of support. His attempt to straddle the abortion issue may have created an even bigger headache for the GOP, which has already suffered electoral consequences in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. Trump wanted credit for that decision, which marked a 50-year-long campaign for conservatives. But his waffling answers on what exactly his policy would be in office and whether he’d sign a total ban on the procedure if passed by a Republican Congress showed he knew he was in a political vise.“I am honored to have done what I did,” Trump said, alluding to his nomination of conservative justices who overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The comment will endear him even more to anti-abortion voters and social conservatives and help ease anxiety among some about his wild personality.“I think that the number one injustice in our country right now is the ending of unborn life,” said Jason Hennessey, president of New Hampshire Right to Life, after leaving the town hall. “If he is the one who can save the babies … I think that that’s more important than the other stuff.”But Democrats are already seizing on the same Trump comment, arguing that the Supreme Court decision, which was out of step with public opinion, hurt Republicans in the midterm elections last year and could help Biden secure a second term in 2024.And Trump’s severe deficit among female voters – whom he lost 57% to 42% in 2020 – is unlikely to have been helped by his sexist descriptions of former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, the plaintiff in the New York defamation and battery civil case, as a “whack job.” And his insult of CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins, who respectfully but perennially fact checked him in real time, as a “nasty person” was another example of his long record of bristling at professional women who stand up to him.One of the most remarkable, yet perhaps unsurprising, aspects of Trump’s performance was that after all that happened in 2020, there was no self-reflection or change in his anti-democratic instincts or his insistence against all evidence that the election was “rigged.”More broadly, the ex-president proved again that he is an outlier among almost all of his predecessors in that he rejects traditional notions of American democracy, global leadership and a sense that the presidency is greater than anyone who shoulders its duties.For instance, he refused to call Putin a “war criminal,” despite the evidence of atrocities committed in his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and warrants issued for his arrest by the International Criminal Court. For Trump, the most important question raised by the conflict is that the United States has sent more aid to Kyiv in defense of democracy than the European Union, which he repeatedly accused of “ripping off” the US in his first term.He inaccurately argued, meanwhile, that the Presidential Records Act meant that he could simply take secret documents home after leaving office and they immediately became declassified. Incidentally, several of his answers on legal investigations bearing down upon him might have given his lawyers fresh headaches. But they reinforced the notion that Trump feels that in office, now and potentially in the future, there are no legal or behavioral constraints that should rein him in.To many Americans, this attitude is directly contradictory to the values of a nation created in opposition to tyranny and in the name of the rule of law. But again, many Republican voters find this an attractive message and see it as the mark of a leader willing to stand up to what they view as a corrupt liberal establishment overtaken by radical left-wing ideology.While many of Trump’s opponents believe his presidency – marked by endless scandals, chaos and challenges to limits on his power – was a disaster, many of the Republicans in the audience on Wednesday perceived his time in office as one of prosperity and success.“The best thing about Trump is that he will bring the best minds in the world into one room to get the best consensus,” said Andrew Georgevits, the chairman of the Republican City Committee in Concord, New Hampshire, as he left the town hall. “He brings people together to get the best results and he truly cares about America.”Still, several of the Republican voters who showed up on Wednesday allowed that they wished Trump could be more disciplined. It’s part of the paradox of his appeal: his wild nature attracts and repels his fans at the same time.Al Peel came to the town hall hoping to get a question to Trump about his own ideas on helping homeless veterans. But he also wished the ex-president would tone down his behavior.“If he could keep off his Twitter account and all his fingers off the keyboard – he’d be a lot more popular,” Peel said. “I think he’s Bozo the Clown, OK. But I love his results.”But while many Republicans believe that Trump’s deliverables make it worth tolerating his outrages, the Biden camp believes that his predecessor’s incorrigible conduct on Wednesday and his obsession with election denialism will again alienate a majority of voters.“It was quite efficient. Weeks’ worth of damning content in one hour,” one adviser told CNN’s Arlette Saenz, hinting at a gold mine of digital and television advertising to come.Some critics of CNN’s decision to hold a town hall with Trump complained that the event was simply a platform for his lies and disinformation. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, took this position in a series of tweets.Yet eight years into Trump’s often extreme stranglehold on American politics, it’s clear that his popularity is not simply rooted in an untamed personality that appears mostly concerned about his grievances and agenda. He speaks to something deep inside millions of citizens and thus represents a seam of the national character and attitude toward democracy.He’s also leading the Republican race for president. And given the unwillingness of major declared – and yet-to-be-declared GOP rivals – to criticize him, nothing that took place on Wednesday night appeared to change that.Trump simply isn’t going away.",politics,0.0

Kevin Cramer, who has not yet endorsed, told CNN’s Manu Raju.The unanimous verdict could deepen his vulnerability among key voting groups, including women – among whom the GOP needs to improve to win back the White House.“I think he would sink. He would not win the White House. He would probably cause us to lose the House and the Senate,” GOP Rep. Don Bacon told CNN’s Melanie Zanona. “I would see very dark clouds on the horizon if he is the nominee,” added Bacon, who represents a Nebraska district President Joe Biden won and has already said he will not support Trump for the nomination.The jury found Trump sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in a New York Department store in 1996 and that he was liable for battery and defamation, while awarding her $5 million. The unanimous jury verdict was vindication for Carroll and offered a symbolic win for other women who have made assault allegations against the president. Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, immediately denounced the trial as a witch hunt and said he didn’t even know Carroll. He said later Tuesday evening that he will appeal.For most of modern US history and for most candidates, Tuesday’s developments would raise potentially insurmountable questions of viability. Many White House hopefuls have exited presidential races for less. And Trump, who’s pleaded not guilty in a separate criminal case involving hush money payments to an adult film star in New York, is facing multiple legal threats. He’s waiting to see whether he will be indicted in separate probes into his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents. But the fact that Trump won’t quit the GOP race – and no one will make him – shows his dominance of the Republican Party, and how he redefined behavioral expectations for public life.No one can know how Tuesday’s verdict will influence the voters in GOP primaries early next year or the outcome of a national election that is 18 months away. Since the trial was civil rather than criminal in nature, Trump will not face a conviction or jail time. And multiple other dramas surrounding Trump, if he’s the nominee, and Biden will likely erupt and shape the campaign next year, when this verdict will be a mere memory.Still, the immediate political reverberations of the Carroll case are already playing out in the Republican presidential race and among key GOP figures in Washington, offering a window into the state of the party and national politics as it stands now.There has so far been silence from most of Trump’s rivals or potential foes in the GOP nominating contest. The lack of response underscores how 2024 hopefuls are struggling to define their profiles as alternatives to him while seeking to avoid angering his supporters. No statement has yet emerged from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley or prospective White House contender, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. While there is a clear sense of exhaustion among some Republican voters over Trump’s endless scandals and personal political vulnerabilities, those who have voiced that frustration aren’t polling anywhere near the former president, if they’re running at all.Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson – who earned 1% in a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents – did step up with an unequivocal condemnation of Trump. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the jury system was sacrosanct, that the jurors in this case had delivered a judgment that meant Trump was not fit to serve and that Republicans should consider the electoral implications of having such a candidate leading their ticket.“I give respect to what juries find. By and large they get it right,” Hutchinson said, arguing that having a president who’d been found liable of sexual abuse would counter core US values. He said that the United States was remarkable for its jury and justice systems. “Let’s not undermine it and disrespect it.”But having defined much of his candidacy against Trump, Hutchinson is considered a longshot.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy characteristically dodged commenting on the verdict after leaving debt crisis talks at the White House on Tuesday. But the California Republican did Trump a service by pointing out that the ex-president – a forceful influence on his narrow House majority – had denied wrongdoing.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a staunch Trump supporter, amplified the ex-president’s claims that he can’t get a fair trial in Manhattan – a reference to the hush money case as well as Tuesday’s verdict. “I think the New York legal system is off the rails when it comes to Donald Trump,” Graham said.One of the most fervent opponents of Trump’s behavior, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, did not hold back. He noted that “the jury of his peers” found Trump liable for sexual abuse “and awarded $5 million to the person who was damaged.” The 2012 GOP presidential nominee added, “I hope the jury of the American people reach the same conclusion about Donald Trump.”As scathing as it was, Romney’s disdain for Trump could have been predicted.Cramer of North Dakota – who in March pointed out that Trump’s indictment in the hush money case didn’t equal a conviction – did express some concern about Tuesday’s developments, though he also nodded to the political factors that could insulate Trump from long-term damage.“It’s very serious. But I think as a political matter, it’s less interesting to the people outside Washington, DC, than it is inside these walls or on Capitol Hill,” he said.“I’d much rather have a president that doesn’t have that history, but at the same time, at some point, there’ll be a binary choice, and then we’ll make it.”This is far from the first time that questions have been raised about Trump’s treatment of women – and how that could turn off some voters. The debate now is whether this time is any different.Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper whether the verdict in New York should disqualify Trump from being the GOP nominee, former Trump White House communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin said, “I guess the answer is, it should.”“This one of the many firsts in history that Donald Trump has managed to achieve – a new low,” added Griffin, now a CNN political commentator. She pointed out that after the 2016 emergence of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape – in which Trump boasted that stars could grab women’s genitals with impunity – many Republicans worried about his character. Now, she argued, those concerns had been validated by a jury of his peers that found Trump liable for sexual abuse. “We cannot afford to put this man up as Republicans if we actually want to win because women will run from voting from him.”Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who has criticized Trump in the past, said: “Of course it creates concern. How could it not create concern?” But he added that it was up to voters to decide whether it should disqualify him.Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he doesn’t think the verdict will affect the Trump base, but it may influence some swing voters who are critical to a general election.“I do think there’s a, you know, cumulative effect to just the constant drama and chaos that always seems to surround him. But, you know, like I said, that doesn’t seem to impact his hardcore supporters,” the South Dakota Republican told reporters.That’s in part a consequence of Trump and his conservative media cheerleaders having done such an effective job of delegitimizing in the eyes of his supporters any institution that holds him to account, including the courts.Trump’s connection with his voters is an emotional one. His coalition delights in his refusal to live by the rules of what are seen as establishment elites – and even the rule of law. His claims that he is a victim of Democrats who have weaponized the legal system are a powerful organizing principle of his campaign. So, it’s hard to see the ex-president’s core supporters turning against him on this issue after so many tumultuous years.One of his staunchest supporters in Congress, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, spelled out a truism of the Trump era when he told reporters Tuesday evening that he didn’t think the verdict “is going to make much of a difference.”",politics,0.0

Bush.Negotiations between the White House and congressional Republicans just got underway Tuesday with the first in-person debt default meeting between President Joe Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other leaders.Moody’s Analytics has predicted a 2008-style crisis, with “spiking interest rates and plunging equity prices,” even if it’s just a brief breach of the debt limit.CNN’s Tami Luhby and Elisabeth Buchwald have documented these possible outcomes: “5 ways a debt default could affect you.”But for all the warnings, the specifics of when the US will cross the so-called X-date – when the country could default – and what will happen in the immediate aftermath are maddeningly vague.“It is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date when Treasury will be unable to pay the government’s bills,” Yellen told McCarthy in a letter last week.She said the X-date could arrive as soon as June 1.Other estimates, like this one from the Bipartisan Policy Center, suggest the X-date could occur any time between early June and early August.The specifics of what exactly will happen seem a bit like forecasting a hurricane – there is a predicted path, but nobody really knows what will happen when the storm makes landfall.While there have been periodic standoffs over the debt ceiling during past periods of divided government, a default has never occurred.And it is important to note, as Luhby and Buchwald do, that the government does not simply cease to operate.“To be clear, a debt default doesn’t mean all payments would stop and people would permanently lose out on money they are owed,” they write. “Treasury would have the funds to satisfy some obligations, but it’s not certain how the agency would handle the disbursements. Much would also depend on how long it takes Congress to address the borrowing cap.”Yellen would have to decide whether to prioritize creditors who own debt or the many people who rely on government money for their paycheck or retirement benefits.Thus, Schumer’s prediction that Social Security would shut down seems unlikely, although payments could be delayed.Some of the worst predictions are based on the event that lawmakers do not quickly come together when markets get spooked by the lack of action.In the scenario of a protracted default, a recession would cost millions of jobs and drive up the unemployment rate, according to a report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers.One likely effect in any default is that simply having the debt will be more expensive. Confidence in the US paying interest on the debt it sells will be shaken. Rates would likely go up.But in the immediate term, there is a distinct lack of clarity on what the Treasury Department would decide to pay and what it might not.For an idea of what it’s facing, look at the Monthly Treasury Statement, the most recent of which is from March.Receipts: $313 billionIn March, the government brought in $313 billion in total receipts, including $151 billion from individual income taxes; $133 billion in social insurance and retirement taxes, which includes Social Security payroll taxes; and $11 billion in corporation income taxes, among other sources.Outlays: $691 billionIn March, the government doled out $115 billion for Medicare, $115 billion to Social Security, $87 billion for income security, $86 billion for health spending, $84 billion for national defense and $67 billion for interest on the debt, among other things.Those figures vary from month to month, and the $378 billion deficit in March was the second largest in the past year.A lot of people get money from the government.There are more than 2 million federal civilian workers, millions of federal contractors and around 1.4 million active-duty military members, plus all of the dependents who rely on them. Delays to their paychecks, if it came to that, would ripple out into the economy.The number of retirees, disabled workers and others who receive monthly Social Security benefits is much larger, at about 66 million.More than a third of US households get Social Security payments and, separately, more than a third of households are covered by Medicare, according to census data from 2020. Nearly a quarter of households get federal help with health insurance for either adults or children.The current impasse between Republicans and the White House is over spending cuts the GOP wants to enact now that it holds a slim majority in the House. They passed a bill through the House as a sort of opening offer in negotiations.While the debt ceiling will have to be lifted in the coming months, cuts in the bill Republicans passed would not begin immediately. Instead, they would be implemented with the 2024 fiscal year.That funding would also get separate votes later this year, so expect additional spending debates. In exchange for the cuts, Republicans are offering an approximately one-year $1.5 trillion debt ceiling hike.RELATED: 43 Senate Republicans vow to oppose debt ceiling increase without spending cutsThe GOP spending cut proposal also lacks specifics.Applying the cuts across the board would reduce spending by an average of 18% over 10 years at every federal agency, according to a New York Times estimate.But Republicans have said they would not target Social Security, Medicare, veterans or defense spending – which make up a very large portion of the budget. Applying the equivalent of an across-the-board cut to the remaining federal agencies could result in more than 50% in cuts over 10 years to spending at every agency from Health and Human Services to the Department of Justice.Biden and Democrats seem unlikely to ever agree to that level of spending cuts. The question is what they will agree to, if anything, and whether any agreement comes before the unknown consequences of a debt default.",politics,0.0
414,438,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/mccarthy-biden-showdown-national-debt/index.html,McCarthy-Biden showdown is about much more than the US national debt,2023-05-09 08:20:00,"The clash between President Joe Biden and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy over the US debt will decide who is the most dominant figure in Washington for most of the next two years. And a failure by the two men to come to terms by this time next month would result in a national default that could have a profound impact on the economy and the 2024 election.While the gravest human impact of a default would be felt by millions of Americans in lost jobs, benefits and an eroded sense of economic security, the showdown is also about power.The huge stakes explain why a meeting between Biden, McCarthy and other top congressional leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday is so critical and will be watched worldwide.It represents a fateful moment in the apparently tense and shallow relationship between the two most powerful people in Washington and will help define a period of bitterly divided government in the capital. Can a Democratic president and a Republican who leads what’s perhaps the most radical House majority ever navigate a solution that satisfies both their incompatible political positions? Or is this disconnect destined to deeply harm the country?The consequences of a default on US debt – which could happen as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t agree to lift the government’s borrowing authority – would be disastrous. The government would have to choose which bills to pay – for instance, between the interest on the national debt or the benefits on which millions of Americans rely. Markets could plunge, a recession could occur and unemployment could rocket. A default would permanently raise US borrowing rates.“We just wouldn’t have enough money to pay the bills. And I think it’s widely agreed that this would be a huge hit to the economy and really an economic catastrophe,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Monday.And a source familiar with the matter told CNN’s Matt Egan Monday night that Yellen has been making calls to CEOs and business leaders to discuss the consequences of brinkmanship around the debt ceiling.Yet it’s this very threat of catastrophe that makes the debt ceiling showdown such an effective tool of political leverage. Both sides in the standoff appear to believe that the other will blink to avoid the appalling consequences of going over the edge of a cliff. But worryingly, each party seems convinced the other will cave to avoid blame.In exchange for raising the debt ceiling, McCarthy – under pressure from a conference packed with extremists and fiscal conservatives – is demanding massive budget cuts to curtail government spending that would effectively crater Biden’s agenda on issues like climate change.Biden argues that the MAGA Republicans – a phrase he uses to attach them to the extremism of ex-President Donald Trump – are holding the economy hostage by refusing to raise the debt limit promptly. He rightly points out they didn’t balk at doing so under his predecessor. He’s ready to discuss government spending but in a regular budget process, not linked to the US obligation to pay debts incurred by previous administrations and approved by Congress.Heading into Tuesday’s meeting, which also includes Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, there is no sign that either side is willing to bend with time running out ahead of the early June date that Yellen has warned about for default.“There’s no plan B,” Bharat Ramamurti, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday.There are at least three potential outcomes of the kind of meeting involving McCarthy and Biden. In some ways, the president’s invitation and the speaker’s acceptance look like a choreographed attempt by each to blame the other for intransigence. The theater on the president’s home turf may send a message that Biden is reasonable while McCarthy is extreme. But if there is no progress, the speaker will likely accuse the president of being stubborn.Biden is determined to hold the line on demanding a clean debt ceiling increase, White House officials say, and the president’s goal is to move spending negotiations onto a separate track – removing the threat of default while giving the GOP assurances he will engage in good-faith negotiations about federal spending.The chance of a breakthrough is slim. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre made clear Monday that the purpose of the meeting was not “debt ceiling negotiations” but a wider spending conversation that McCarthy is not ready to have.An obvious breakdown of the talks could spook the markets and paradoxically add to political pressure for Biden and McCarthy to find a compromise. A sign that they are willing to talk again could fuel speculation that Congress could pass a short-term debt ceiling increase to defer the crisis to a later date and give the two sides time to work a way out of the mess.A president has personal goals and political requirements but also assumes a greater responsibility for the wellbeing of the country. True political leadership comes at the intersection of these two often conflicting impulses. Biden may face such a situation now. A debt default and its consequences could be disastrous for his recently announced reelection campaign and add to challenges, ranging from a border crisis to concerns about his age, that are complicating his political future.But conceding to McCarthy would make him look weak – a corrosive image for any president – and would suggest that House Republicans can browbeat him for the rest of his term.Biden’s trouble stirring enthusiasm from Democratic voters, revealed in multiple polls, means he can’t afford to show he is dominated by McCarthy. In the past, a domestic battle that allows a Democratic president to portray Republicans as extremists ready to wreck the economy for partisan gain has been a powerful galvanizing force.So for reasons of governance and politics, Biden has every incentive to stand firm, even as tensions and anxiety over a possible debt default mount. He doesn’t have the numbers in Congress to force Republicans to bend. And he’s sticking to his line that only Congress has the capacity to raise the debt ceiling and that if it fails to do so, Republicans standing in the way will be to blame for a massive self-inflicted national disaster.“This is a crisis that is being entirely provoked by House Republicans who have the ability tomorrow to put a bill on the floor that would raise the debt limit without conditions,” Ramamurti said, adding that at that point Biden would be happy discuss tax and spending policy.McCarthy’s position may be even more politically dicey than Biden’s. One factor that makes the situation so potentially dangerous is the narrowness of the Republican majority that he leads. Paradoxically, voters who worried about handing the GOP a big win in November because of pro-Trump extremism may have inadvertently driven the majority further right.That’s because radicalized Republican lawmakers now have the capacity to hold McCarthy to ransom and to extract big concessions. This dynamic played out in the 15 rounds it took the Californian to win the speakership in January and last month when the House passed a plan to raise the debt ceiling in return for huge spending cuts. The plan, which passed by just one vote, will not be taken up in the Democratic-led Senate and has been rejected by Biden.Still, as narrow as it might be, McCarthy does have a mandate to seek to implement the wishes of millions of Republican voters who want to see a slowdown in spending – even if the GOP’s fiscal discipline does only seem to kick in when a Democrat is the White House.“The House Republican majority was elected to serve as a check and balance in large part because of the reckless spending engaged in by the Biden administration,” New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who flipped a Democratic seat in the midterms, told CNN on Monday.The New York Republican will be directly targeted by Biden on Wednesday when the president travels to his district as part of an apparent plan to pressure more moderate Republicans on the debt ceiling. Lawler urged the White House to use the just-passed GOP bill as a starting point.“The president and Senate majority obviously do not like it. That’s their prerogative. That’s their right. But we are split government. So we need to all work together, come to the table and have an honest dialogue.”Lawler’s comment raises the question of whether Biden’s position is incompatible with the reality of divided power in Washington and may not be sustainable in the long term.In more normal political times, it would not be hard to see a scenario where Biden – a fabled deal maker in half a century of Washington life – and the speaker could offer one another sufficient concessions for each to save face and for disaster to be avoided. A classic Washington fudge might see Biden able to claim he had secured a debt ceiling hike without concessions, while in a companion budget deal McCarthy could say he halted Democratic spending sprees. But this is a long way away in a polarized capital.And even if they could do a deal, the most daunting aspect of the crisis remains. McCarthy, who can only afford to lose four votes, may not be able to get his wild and tiny House majority to agree. And if he tried to use Democratic votes to get a bill over the line, he’d probably lose his job.So the prospects that Tuesday’s meeting will yield a breakthrough are not promising.",politics,0.0
415,439,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/politics/texas-gun-laws-what-matters/index.html,Greg Abbott’s gun law avoidance strategy,2023-05-08 17:52:00,"Steven Spainhouer is a Second Amendment supporter and a gun owner. But after pulling a bloody child out from under a dead adult – one of eight killed at an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, on Saturday – he’s ready for a new national assault weapons ban.“I hear our governor talking about mental health issues,” Spainhouer said of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott during a Monday appearance on “CNN This Morning.”“We’re always going to have mental health issues. But if we don’t do something about the guns, the people-killing guns, then we’re going to continue to have the same thing happen,” Spainhouer said.“Until we take some definite actions, we’re changing the narrative about it being just a mental health issue and start doing something about the guns,” he added.He equated the kind of imposition an assault weapons ban places on individual rights to limits on certain types of speech. Watch the interview with Spainhouer.Rather than moving toward a new assault weapons ban, Americans almost seem used to mass shootings. They are “part of the background noise of daily life,” CNN’s Stephen Collinson wrote last week after a mass shooting in Atlanta.“They are part of the national reality – almost like bad weather – that causes people to shudder and hope it doesn’t affect their neighborhoods or their families before they carry on with their lives.”If the shootings feel somehow normal, so do the post-shooting promises from politicians.As Spainhouer noted, Abbott returned to his familiar post-shooting refrain that it’s not gun laws that are needed, but a focus on mental health.“We’ve seen an increased number of shootings in states with easy gun laws as well as states with very strict gun laws,” Abbott, a Republican, said on “Fox News Sunday.”Abbott said there’s an increase in “anger and violence” and the root cause is “mental health problems.”Admitting that Texas has lagged in mental health for years, he said the state has increased funding over the past three years.“The long-term solution here is to address the mental health issue,” Abbott said.It’s an argument that also quietly acknowledges the fact that most gun deaths in Texas are suicides.But while Abbott argued, correctly, that mass shootings can happen in any state, what he failed to mention is that that there are just simply more gun deaths, including suicides, in states with more lax gun laws. We looked at that data in this newsletter almost exactly a year ago after the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.Another Texas Republican, Rep. Keith Self, also blamed mental health during an interview on CNN on Saturday.“We have people with mental health, though, that we’re not taking care of,” said Self, who represents the Dallas suburb of Allen in Congress. “Since this nation made the decision that we were going to close the mental health institutions, many of these situations are based on that.”Questions about mental health have been a theme in Texas shootings.Devin Patrick Kelley, for instance, killed 26 people with an AR-15-style rifle at a rural Texas church in a mass shooting in 2017. He legally obtained his weapons despite escaping from a mental health facility in 2012 and being convicted of domestic violence. Kelley passed a background check in part because the Air Force failed to enter his conviction into federal databases, according to The New York Times.Other shooters might never be flagged for mental illness. The Uvalde shooter, Salvador Ramos, was a loner who used a social media app to threaten school shootings in the weeks leading up to his rampage.It was a major understatement for Abbott to say that Texas merely lags on mental health.A report from the nonprofit Mental Health America places the state at or near the bottom of multiple metrics for mental health care. Texas places last in the nation in terms of access to mental health care. It ranks third in terms of prevalence of mental illness.Texas State Sen. Jose Menendez, a Democrat, accused Abbott and others of using the mental health issue as a smoke screen to avoid more meaningful change, like implementing a so-called red flag law.“It appears that using mental health is just a shield in order to not address the issue of what’s actually killing the people,” Menendez told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Monday, adding he agrees that more should be done for people with mental illness.“But we also have to do something about what’s actually killing the people, and that is these guns, these high-powered guns,” Menendez said.“There’s a reason we don’t allow people to have grenades and bazookas,” Menendez said. “These are weapons of war. And I believe these AR-15 high-capacity rifles are also weapons that belong in the theater of war.”Menendez complained that proposals related to safe gun and ammunition storage and proposals for a red flag law, universal background checks and increased age limits for semi-automatic rifles have no chance in Texas. After Menendez’s comments, a bill to raise the age limit for some rifles saw some movement in the Texas House, but it still faces long odds.Despite Abbot’s repeated promises to focus on mental health, Texas has no red flag law – also known as an extreme risk protection order law – which would allow authorities to take weapons from a person thought to be in crisis.The gunman in this most recent mass shooting, Mauricio Garcia, was killed by a local police officer. He does appear to have a history of mental illness. A law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN that Garcia served in the military for a brief period but was removed due to concerns about his mental health.Garcia was also apparently wearing an “RWDS” insignia – short for “Right Wing Death Squad” – on his tactical vest, suggesting at least an affinity for extremist groups. That idea is reinforced by a social media presence in which authorities say he shared neo-Nazi and White supremacist-related posts. Read CNN’s full report about Garcia.Congress did pass legislation last year to encourage states to pass red flag laws, but Texas has not yet followed through. And with a patchwork of laws, even states that pass their own cannot stop weapons from crossing their borders.",politics,0.0
418,442,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-january-6-cnn-town-hall/index.html,Fact checking Trump’s claims about January 6 during CNN’s townhall,2023-05-11 11:04:00,"Former President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump participated in a CNN town hall Wednesday where he made numerous false claims about the violence at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.Here is a fact check of some of those claims.Former President Donald Trump tried to blame then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the violence on January 6, 2021 – when his own supporters stormed the US Capitol, claiming she was “in charge” of security that day.Facts First: This is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. That’s the responsibility of the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the US Capitol Police and approves requests for National Guard assistance.Trump’s former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller also told lawmakers that he was never given a formal order by Trump to have 10,000 troops ready to be sent to the Capitol on January 6. “There was no direct, there was no order from the president,” Miller said.Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent an email saying the National Guard would be present to “protect pro Trump people” in the lead up to the US Capitol insurrection, according to the report released by the January 6 committee.From CNN’s Zachary CohenTrump asserted “a couple” of the January 6 rioters “probably got out of control,” comparing the insurrection to left-leaning protests that turned violent in other cities.Facts First: This statement is false. Hundreds of rioters have been charged with violence toward police on January 6 and Trump downplaying the violence and equivocating the insurrection with social justice protests fails to recognize the severity of the attack on the Capitol.The January 6 riot of Trump-supporters who overran the Capitol has resulted in the largest law enforcement response in modern history – because of the sheer amount of violence on the ground, especially toward police, that day.The number of rioters on January 6 who’ve been charged with violence toward police is in the hundreds.According to the Justice Department this week, 346 people face federal charges for assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or other employees. That includes more than 100 people charged with using a weapon or causing serious injury to an officer. About five dozen have pleaded guilty to felony charges for these types of crimes.And the FBI is still seeking information to identify more than 220 others who may have committed violent crimes on the Capitol grounds.Even Trump-appointed federal judges have countered claims that left-leaning rioters in Portland, for instance, acted similarly to the pro-Trump crowd on January 6.Judge Trevor McFadden wrote when handling a January 6 rioter’s case in 2021: “Although both Portland and January 6 rioters attacked federal buildings, the Portland defendants primarily attacked at night, meaning that they raged against a largely vacant courthouse. In contrast, the January 6 rioters attacked the Capitol in broad daylight. And many entered it.”And another federal judge in DC, Carl Nichols, wrote: “The Portland rioters’ conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Nor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America’s Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings’ outer defenses.”Trump said that the police officer who shot pro-Trump rioter Ashli Babbitt was a “thug” who “went on television to brag about the fact that he killed her.”Facts First: The US Capitol Police officer involved in the shooting, Lt. Michael Byrd, was defending the Speaker’s Lobby, adjacent to the House chamber in the Capitol building, during the riot. Babbitt’s fatal shooting occurred as a crowd tried to push through the Speaker’s Lobby doorway while the House was in still in session, according to the House select committee investigating January 6.The Capitol Police declined to pursue any disciplinary action against Byrd, saying that they had “determined the officer’s conduct was lawful and within Department policy.” The Justice Department also said they would not prosecute Byrd, saying there was “insufficient evidence” to support a criminal case.Byrd later did an interview with “NBC Nightly News,” where he said that he acted because “there was imminent threat and danger to the members of Congress.” Byrd said during the interview that he came forward publicly after being the focus of vitriol in right-wing circles.From CNN’s Hannah RabinowitzTrump said that he doesn’t believe then Vice President Mike Pence was “in any danger” during the several hours that a pro-Trump mob laid siege to the Capitol building on January 6, 2021.Facts First: While Trump’s belief is subjective, this statement leaves out key details.Although Pence was safely evacuated from the Senate chamber, swarms of rioters were caught on videotape moving through the Capitol building chanting “hang Mike Pence!”Other threats levied at Pence from members of the mob included “If Pence caved, we’re going to drag m*therf*ckers through the streets,” and that Pence “is nothing but a traitor” and “deserves to burn with the rest of them.”  Pence himself said that the former president’s “reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.”From CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz",politics,0.0
419,443,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-town-hall/index.html,Fact-checking Trump’s CNN town hall in New Hampshire,2023-05-11 10:44:00,"CNN hosted a town hall with 2024 Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday night in New Hampshire.Over the course of the night, Trump took questions from New Hampshire Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to vote in the 2024 GOP presidential primary about a wide range of issues.Trump made many false and unsubstantiated claims about the 2020 election, violence on January 6, 2021, the economy and his handling of records after leaving the White House.Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s other claims during the townhall.Just minutes after the town hall began, Trump claimed the 2020 election was “rigged.”Facts First: This is Trump’s regular lie. He lost the 2020 election to Biden fair and square, 306 to 232 in the Electoral College. Biden earned more than 7 million more votes than Trump did. Trump’s own campaign and senior officials in his administration found no evidence for his claims of widespread fraud.From CNN’s Tara SubramaniamTalking about the upcoming 2024 presidential election, Trump said “I hope we’re going to have very honest elections. We should have voter ID.”Facts First: It’s misleading at best for Trump to claim voter ID doesn’t currently exist in US election.There are several situations in which casting a ballot without showing an ID would be legal, specifically in the 15 states (plus Washington, DC) that rely on other forms of voter verification. In the rest of the states, voters are required to present some form of identification before casting ballots.It is true that most Democrats have been against stricter voter-ID laws in the past, but on grounds that these laws could disenfranchise voters who may not have access to necessary identification – not in order to illegally obtain votes.Republicans have wielded this Democratic position on voter ID laws to paint Democrats as complicit in election fraud despite the fact that voter fraud is exceedingly rare – and that even states that don’t require ID have other methods to prevent fraud, like signature checks.From CNN’s Tara SubramaniamAs part of his argument that the 2020 election was “rigged,” Trump claimed 51 intelligence agents “made a 16-point difference” in the outcome of the election.Facts First: There is no evidence for this.Trump appears to have been referring to a letter signed by former intelligence agents weeks before the 2020 election. The letter stated that the release of emails purportedly belonging to then-candidate Joe Biden’s son Hunter, which had been generating sensational stories in right-wing media, had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.”No proof of Russian involvement in the release of those emails has emerged, and Republicans have argued that the letter helped discredit negative stories about the Biden family just before the election. But there’s also no proof that the letter swayed the outcome of the election.From CNN’s Curt DevineFormer President Donald Trump tried to blame then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the violence on January 6, 2021 – when his own supporters stormed the US Capitol, claiming she was “in charge” of security that day.Facts First: This is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. That’s the responsibility of the Capitol Police Board, which oversees the US Capitol Police and approves requests for National Guard assistance.Trump’s former acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller also told lawmakers that he was never given a formal order by Trump to have 10,000 troops ready to be sent to the Capitol on January 6. “There was no direct, there was no order from the president,” Miller said.Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent an email saying the National Guard would be present to “protect pro Trump people” in the lead up to the US Capitol insurrection, according to the report released by the January 6 committee.From CNN’s Zachary CohenTrump claimed gas prices are higher under Biden than under his administration, and that Biden ended US energy independence.Facts First: Trump’s claims about gas prices are misleading. Trump claimed Wednesday that he got gas prices down to $1.87 – and “even lower” – but they increased to $7, $8 or even $9 under Biden. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. On Thursday, the national average for gas was $3.53, per AAA data, not $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, had an average of $4.8, per AAA.Trump’s claim that Biden shut down American energy is false even if Trump was talking specifically about non-renewable energy. US crude oil production in 2022 was the second-highest on record, behind only production in Trump-era 2019, and production in early 2023 has been near record highs. US production of dry natural gas set a new record in 2022. So did US exports of crude oil and petroleum products.Biden has also approved some significant fossil fuel projects including the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska, and his administration outpaced Trump’s when it came to approving oil and gas drilling permits in Biden’s first two years in office.From CNN’s Ella NilsenAsked about the now-notorious phone call he made to Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and staff about election results, Trump claimed “I didn’t ask them to find anything.”Facts First: This is a brazenly false claim, as CNN and other organizations obtained recordings of the call, in which Trump repeatedly suggests that Georgia election officials should be able to find thousands of votes and fraudulent ballots. Specifically, Trump said, “I just want to find 11,780 votes,” one more than he lost by.Trump also told Raffensberger, a GOP official, “We think that if you check the signatures – a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County you’ll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged.”It’s worth noting that Trump’s assertions of forged signatures and missing or miscounted votes were also baseless. The state certified its election results three times under Raffensperger’s leadership and found no mass voter fraud.From CNN’s Tara SubramaniamTrump asserted “a couple” of the January 6 rioters “probably got out of control,” comparing the insurrection to left-leaning protests that turned violent in other cities.Facts First: This statement is false. Hundreds of rioters have been charged with violence toward police on January 6 and Trump downplaying the violence and equivocating the insurrection with social justice protests fails to recognize the severity of the attack on the Capitol.The January 6 riot of Trump-supporters who overran the Capitol has resulted in the largest law enforcement response in modern history – because of the sheer amount of violence on the ground, especially toward police, that day.The number of rioters on January 6 who’ve been charged with violence toward police is in the hundreds.According to the Justice Department this week, 346 people face federal charges for assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or other employees.

Babbitt’s fatal shooting occurred as a crowd tried to push through the Speaker’s Lobby doorway while the House was in still in session, according to the House select committee investigating January 6.The Capitol Police declined to pursue any disciplinary action against Byrd, saying that they had “determined the officer’s conduct was lawful and within Department policy.” The Justice Department also said they would not prosecute Byrd, saying there was “insufficient evidence” to support a criminal case.Byrd later did an interview with “NBC Nightly News,” where he said that he acted because “there was imminent threat and danger to the members of Congress.” Byrd said during the interview that he came forward publicly after being the focus of vitriol in right-wing circles.From CNN’s Hannah RabinowitzA day after a Manhattan federal jury found Trump sexually abused and defamed the writer E. Jean Carroll, Trump claimed that the jury in the civil trial found he did not rape her and said he “didn’t do anything else either.”“They said he didn’t rape her, and I didn’t do anything else either,” Trump said.Facts First: This statement requires more context. While the jury did not find that Carroll had proven rape, it did find that she proved Trump committed sexual abuse, sufficient to hold him liable for battery.Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s and then later defamed her when he denied her claim.In the civil suit, the jury had to determine whether Carroll’s legal team proved that Trump committed battery against Carroll by a preponderance of the evidence.While it did not determine that Carroll’s team had proven rape – the state’s law says that a person is liable for rape when a person forces sexual intercourse with another person without their consent – it did find that they proved Trump committed sexual abuse.The jury had been instructed that a person is liable for sexual abuse when they subject another person without consent to sexual contact, which under New York law means “any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party.”From CNN’s Nicki BrownTrump claimed that inflation under President Biden has been the highest level in 52 years.Facts First: This is false. The inflation rate has been high by historical standards but was not close to a half-century high.Last June, the year-over-year inflation rate hit its highest level since late 1981, 9.1%, a surge that was caused by a variety of factors, including the war in Ukraine, the global pandemic and its effect on consumer behavior, and supply chain disruptions. But about 41 years does not round to 52 years, and more importantly, year-over-year inflation has now declined for 10 straight months, hitting 4.9% in April, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.From CNN’s Alicia WallaceTrump claimed that other presidents took records with them when they left the White House –  including Barack Obama, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.“The Presidential Records Act is not criminal. I took the documents. I’m allowed to. You know who else took them? Obama took them, Nixon took them. Reagan took them.”Facts First: It is not true that past presidents took documents after they left office, as the National Archives and Records Administration itself pointed out in a statement in 2022. In reality, NARA was granted custody of the presidential records of former presidents (beginning with Ronald Reagan) as soon as these presidents left office, as required by the Presidential Records Act. In addition, it was NARA, not those presidents, that moved those documents out of the nation’s capital to NARA-managed temporary archival facilities near where their permanent presidential libraries would be built.After Trump began making these false claims last year, NARA issued an October 2022 statement saying that it gained physical and legal custody of the records from Obama, Clinton, Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush “when those presidents left office.” It said of the temporary facilities to which the documents were moved: “All such temporary facilities met strict archival and security standards, and have been managed and staffed exclusively by NARA employees. Reports that indicate or imply that those Presidential records were in the possession of the former Presidents or their representatives, after they left office, or that the records were housed in substandard conditions, are false and misleading.”In other words, there is no equivalence between how Trump handled presidential documents and how those previous presidents did. In Trump’s case, the presidential documents found at Mar-a-Lago, including documents marked classified, were in Trump’s possession despite numerous attempts by both NARA and the Justice Department to get them back.In an April 24 statement, NARA General Counsel Gary M. Stern clarified that NARA sent staff members to the White House in the final weeks of the Trump Administration “to assist with the move of the physical records (including artifacts), in coordination with the DOD team that NARA employed to transport the records from the White House complex to the National Archives.”Stern noted that the assistance provided was in line with what NARA had done for the three previous Presidential transitions.Finally, Trump is correct that the Presidential Records Act is not a criminal law. Yet the Justice Department has made clear Trump is being investigated because of classified records that the NARA found in boxes that he returned a year after he left office, and his subsequent actions. The DOJ’s criminal investigation continues to focus on the possible mishandling of national security information and federal records, as well as possible attempts by Trump or others to obstruct justice after the criminal investigation became known.From CNN’s Tara SubramaniamTrump claimed that the US has provided $171 billion “so far” to Ukraine in its war against Russia, while the European Union cumulatively has given $20 billion in aid. He also claimed that the US is “giving away so much” that “we don’t have ammunition for ourselves right now.”Fact First: Both assertions are false. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine last February, the US has provided Ukraine $36.9 billion in military aid. And while some US and European weapon stockpiles have been depleted, the claim that the US does not have ammunition is false.The US military and defense industry are planning to increase production of critical ammunition being sent to Ukraine to fill US stocks. The US Army is planning a 500% increase in 155mm artillery shells, a roughly 33% increase in Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) surface-to-surface medium-range missiles a year, doubling production of Javelin anti-tank missiles, and increasing production of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to a minimum of 60 a month.From CNN’s Haley BritzkeyTrump claimed that the classified documents from the White House were “automatically declassified” when he took them to Mar-a-Lago.Facts First: There is no evidence to back up this assertion. Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so.The Justice Department said in an August 2022 court filing that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified—not in January 2022 when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings, nor in June 2022 when Trump’s team responded to a subpoena by returning another batch that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.In addition, 18 former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN at the time that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”From CNN’s Hannah RabinowitzTrump claimed that he had finished his promised wall on the border with Mexico.“I did finish the wall. I built a wall,” he said. “I built hundreds of miles of wall, and I finished it, and then I said we have to build some more.”Facts First: It’s not true that Trump finished the border wall. According to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not been completed. The report said that at the time, just 52 miles of new wall had been constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed.The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280 miles left to go, about 74 miles were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”From CNN’s Daniel DaleTrump claimed on Wednesday night he had “every right under the Presidential Records Act” to keep classified documents from his White House after he left the presidency. “I have the absolute right to do whatever I want to do with them,” he said.Facts First: Trump’s claim is false.The Presidential Records Act says that the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets legal custody and control of all presidential records from his administration. Nothing in the law says there should be a negotiation between a former president and NARA over a former president’s return of presidential documents – much less that there should have been a monthslong battle after NARA first contacted Trump’s team in 2021 to try to get some of the records that had not been handed over at the end of his presidency.The key sentence from the Presidential Records Act is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”Jason R. Baron, former director of litigation at NARA, told CNN in a March 2023 email: “The former President is simply wrong as a matter of law. As of noon on January 20, 2021, when President Biden took office, all presidential records of the Trump Administration came into the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States. Full stop. That means no presidential records ever should have been transferred to Mar-a-Lago, and there was no further talking or negotiating to be had.”Timothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, New York University professor and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, described Trump’s claim as “nonsense” and said the former president’s description of the Presidential Records Act is “a matter of fantasy,” concocted to allow Trump to “pretend that he’s a victim.”The law, Naftali said in March 2023, makes clear that documents Trump had at Mar-a-Lago are presidential records that legally belong to the public and are legally required to be in NARA’s custody. The law provides “no room for debates and discussions between presidential advisers and the National Archives at the end a presidency” about such records, Naftali said.In April 2023, the Society of American Archivists, a professional association, published its own fact check of Trump’s claim, saying it is “patently false.”From CNN’s Katelyn PolantzTrump said repeatedly his team was negotiating with the National Archives over his presidential records after he left office, accusing the Justice Department of unnecessarily escalating the situation with the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022.“We were negotiating with NARA. All of a sudden they raid our house,” Trump said on Wednesday night.Facts First: Trump’s statement has a few problems. First, there’s no provision for negotiating over Presidential records at the end of a term. Second, Trump left out several key events ahead of the FBI’s search of Trump’s Florida beach resort. Trump’s representatives had been in discussions with the National Archives for months before they shipped back 15 boxes. In those, the Archives found many records with classified markings, prompting the agency to get the Justice Department involved.Federal criminal investigators wanted the FBI and the intelligence community to review the returned documents for possible damage to national security. Around the same time, prosecutors visited Mar-a-Lago to try to make sure all classified records were back in the federal government’s possession, following up on a May 2022 grand jury subpoena seeking all classified records in Trump’s possession.Trump’s lawyers handed over an envelope wrapped in tape with a few dozen more documents in it.But then, prosecutors developed additional evidence that even more classified records were still being kept at Mar-a-Lago – and that documents in a locked storage room that the investigators had noticed containing boxes had been concealed and removed from the room.That series of events during the summer of 2022 – specifically the questions it raised that someone within Mar-a-Lago tried to obstruct federal investigators from finding records Trump failed to turn over in response to a grand jury subpoena – provided some of the basis for the DOJ to get court approval to search the club.From CNN’s Katelyn PolantzIn defending his stance on abortion, Trump accused Democrats and Hillary Clinton of supporting abortion late into the third trimester, saying that “they will kill the baby in the ninth month.”Facts First: This is misleading.Clinton’s stance was that mothers whose health or life is in jeopardy should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy at any point up until birth. Later term abortions are rare. In 2020, less than 1% of abortions in the US occurred at 21 weeks or later, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vast majority of abortions (93%) occurred at or before 13 weeks.Under Roe v. Wade, states had the authority to regulate or ban abortion in the third trimester except when necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.From CNN’s Deidre McPhillipsTrump touted that he got Americans the biggest tax cuts in history, which helped spur a strong economy.“We created the greatest economy in history. A big part of that economy was I got you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, bigger than the Reagan cuts,” Trump said, referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.Facts First: Trump is wrong. At least two analyses have found that the act was not the largest in history, though they differ on where it ranks.The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates.The Treasury Department has examined the size of past tax cuts and found that since 1968, three other tax cut bills have been bigger, including former President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 package and two bills passed by former President Barack Obama to extend earlier tax cuts signed by former President George W. Bush.Treasury measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product – in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts away as a portion of the economy. Reagan’s 1981 cut was 2.9% of GDP. Obama’s tax cut extensions in 2010 and 2012 were 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively.Trump’s tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1.1% of GDP per year.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the framework for the tax cuts would be the eighth largest since 1918, as a percentage of gross domestic product.From CNN’s Tami LuhbyTrump said that he doesn’t believe then Vice President Mike Pence was “in any danger” during the several hours that a pro-Trump mob laid siege to the Capitol building on January 6, 2021.Facts First: While Trump’s belief is subjective, this statement leaves out key details.Although Pence was safely evacuated from the Senate chamber, swarms of rioters were caught on videotape moving through the Capitol building chanting “hang Mike Pence!”Other threats levied at Pence from members of the mob included “If Pence caved, we’re going to drag m*therf*ckers through the streets,” and that Pence “is nothing but a traitor” and “deserves to burn with the rest of them.”  Pence himself said that the former president’s “reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.”From CNN’s Hannah RabinowitzTrump suggested he was able to get European NATO members to increase their defense spending commitments where his predecessors had failed.“I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars that they weren’t paying under Obama and Bush and all of these other presidents,” Trump said.Facts First: This is misleading. While European NATO members’ defense spending did increase under Trump, their spending had been increasing before he took office, including under Obama.NATO notes on its website that 2022 was “the eighth consecutive year of rising defence spending across European Allies and Canada.”NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg did credit Trump for securing increases in European NATO members’ defense spending, but those countries’ spending had also increased in the last two years of the Obama administration following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and the recommitment that year to the guideline calling for NATO members to spend at least 2% of their GDP on military.From CNN’s Tara SubramaniamAmong Trump’s litany of falsehoods about the 2020 election, he claimed “so many illegal votes were cast in Wisconsin,” and that “in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, they had so many illegal votes.Facts First: There is no evidence of illegal votes cast in Wisconsin. A recount requested by the Trump campaign specifically confirmed the initial result establishing Joe Biden’s victory in the state.Milwaukee County, Wisconsin’s largest, certified its presidential general election results after the requested recount, which found that Biden actually saw a small net gain in votes.It’s possible Trump was referring to a state Supreme Court ruling from July 2022 that bars the use of most ballot drop boxes in Wisconsin for future elections. Trump has used that ruling to renew his claims that he won Wisconsin because ballot drop boxes were in use.Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said Trump even called him after the ruling in hopes of launching a fresh effort to decertify the state’s 2020 presidential election results, which is constitutionally impossible at this time. Additionally, the ruling does not mean the use of ballot drop boxes in the 2020 election were illegal.From CNN’s Tara Subramaniam",politics,0.0
420,444,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-attacked-civil-rights-movement/index.html,Republican front-runner for North Carolina governor attacked Civil Rights Movement: ‘So many freedoms were lost’,2023-05-11 17:42:00,"North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the state’s first Black lieutenant governor and the GOP front-runner for the 2024 gubernatorial race, repeatedly lambasted the “so-called” 1960s Civil Rights Movement, lamenting that “so many freedoms were lost during the civil rights movement.”In a CNN KFile review of his media appearances over the last five years, Robinson baselessly claimed that the Civil Rights Movement was a communist plot to “subvert capitalism” and used “to subvert free choice and where you go to school and things like that.”“So many things were lost during the Civil Rights Movement. So many freedoms were lost during the Civil Rights Movement. They shouldn’t have been lost,” Robinson said in a March 2018 podcast episode.Robinson made many of the comments on the podcast “Politics and Prophecy” with host Chris Levels on Freedomizer Radio, a station whose slogan says “Freedomists Freedomizing Freedom.” Levels is a conspiracy theorist who has shared 9/11 truther posts on Facebook, called the Olympics an illuminati event from Satan and shared posts saying Jews control nearly everything in society.Robinson’s previously unreported comments criticizing the Civil Rights Movement starkly contrast the rhetoric he recently espoused highlighting his hometown of Greensboro, North Carolina, as “an epicenter of the Civil Rights’ Movement.” Greensboro was home to the Woolworth lunch counter sit-in-protests in 1960 started by four Black students, one of whom – Clarence Henderson – Robinson later befriended after launching his political career.Robinson is currently seen as the GOP favorite for North Carolina’s gubernatorial race, where he will likely face Democrat Josh Stein, the state’s attorney general. The current Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, is term-limited.After publication, Robinson published a video with Clarence Henderson, a civil rights icon, saying that he “couldn’t be more proud” of Henderson’s work in the Civil Rights Movement and now. Robinson ended the video by saying, “I’ll tell you what. You made history in this state once before. I’m gonna make history again.”Prior to his political career, Robinson frequently referred to the civil rights’ era as the “so-called Civil Rights Movement” and criticized the Greensboro lunch counter protests as a “ridiculous premise” designed to pull “the rug out from underneath capitalism and free choice and the free market.”“You talk about the sit-in movement. We’re in a free market system. So we’ve got a place called Woolworth in Greensboro that won’t serve Blacks at the lunch counter. What do you do? You go down there and you sit at the lunch counter and you demand for these people to take your money. How crazy is that?” said Robinson in March 2018. “That’s not what you do in a free market system. What you do in a free market system is you just say, ‘Hey guys, these guys don’t treat people fair. Do not eat here.’”“A place where everybody can eat and let’s see who does the best. That’s what you do in a free market system. You don’t force these guys to take your – sit there and you know, ‘You’re gonna take my money. You’re gonna take my money. I’m gonna enrich you whether you like it or not,’” he said, adopting a silly voice. “That’s a ridiculous premise. You know, and I’ve always argued that. But it goes hand-in-hand with that whole thing of, uh, communists and socialists slowly pulling the rug out from underneath capitalism and free choice and the free market.”But in a story Robinson relayed on a podcast in June 2022, during his first term as lieutenant governor, he recalled sitting at the lunch counter at Woolworth’s as a child and not appreciating the history of the place.“I used to sit at that counter and eat that hot, eat, eat my food. My feet wouldn’t even touch the floor when I sat on the stool ‘cause I was so small. And I sat at that counter and when I think back on it now, I think I had no idea what happened there as a kid. I had no idea the cost that people had to pay for me to be able to come in there and sit at that counter. And that’s just always been something that’s been very striking,” said Robinson.In other comments, Robinson blamed the movement for destroying “hundreds of very well-run Black schools” and black businesses.“The Civil Rights Movement destroyed hundreds of very well-run Black schools. They destroyed Black businesses across the nation. Once businesses became integrated right here in Greensboro, once Woolworth became integrated and the other cafeterias, white cafeterias became integrated, Black folks stopped going to the Black businesses. And they went out of business.”“And they went out of business because we start [sic] giving our dollars to people who didn’t want them to begin with or want them on their terms. If we had not listened to those communists and had put our dollars in our pockets and built up our society, we could have drawn well-meaning Whites to our side and run Woolworth out of business instead of the other way around,” said Robinson.This was not the first time Robinson made unpopular comments on historical figures. In another episode of Politics and Prophecy from November 2018, Robinson said that former President Lydon B. Johnson’s “Great Society,” a series of policy initiatives to reform social welfare, were a way to keep Black Americans on a “de facto plantation” and keep “negroes” in their place.“I believe that was the intention of Lyndon Johnson and all of his, uh, all of his cronies was to create a system that would keep Black folks in their place, keep them on a de facto plantation where they could not branch out and steadily ratchet up the pressure on them. Steadily bring the walls in on ‘em. And it has been a concentrated effort ever since to make sure that Negroes stay in their place,” he said.And in a Facebook Live post from January 2019, Robinson praised Sen. Joseph McCarthy, a Republican politician known for claiming that “card-carrying” communists had infiltrated the federal government, Hollywood and universities in order to subvert the United States.“Folks laughed at [Joseph] McCarthy back in the fifties when he was talking about communism invading these shores. But those folks were telling the truth. And now because people ignored that truth, those things have come back in spades,” he said. “Folks didn’t believe [Joseph] McCarthy when he said our government was covered up with communists. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders is proof of that.”Neither Ocasio-Cortez nor Sanders are communists; they are self-declared democratic socialists.",politics,0.0
422,446,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/ohio-special-election-constitution-abortion-rights/index.html,Ohio Republicans approve August election that could thwart abortion-rights push in state,2023-05-11 15:52:00,"Ohio voters will decide this summer whether to make it more difficult to change the state’s constitution – only months before a potential ballot measure in November over whether to guarantee abortion rights in the state.Ohio’s Republican-controlled legislature this week approved a resolution that will ask voters in August to increase the threshold needed to change the constitution from a simple majority to 60%. It also would require backers of ballot initiatives to get signatures from voters in all of Ohio’s 88 counties – rather than current 44 – to place something on the ballot.Voters also could decide to eliminate the 10-day period during which citizen groups are currently allowed to gather additional voter signatures if their petitions are found to lack the required amount of valid signatures.The special election will be held August 8. The election measure passed in the form of a joint resolution and does not require the governor’s signature to take effect.The move comes after abortion rights supporters in the state won approval to begin collecting signatures to put a measure on the November ballot that would guarantee Ohioans’ access to abortion. If approved by voters, state officials could not prohibit abortion until after fetal viability, the point at which doctors say the fetus can survive outside the womb.Critics of the August special election say it amounts to an end-run around voters and is part of a broader campaign by opponents of abortion to thwart citizen-approved ballot measures enshrining abortion rights.The US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year left abortion laws up to the states, and abortion rights groups quickly scored wins on ballot measures in six of them – including in the battleground state of Michigan, where voters protected abortion access, and in the Republican strongholds of Kansas, Kentucky and Montana, where voters defeated efforts to restrict abortions.In Ohio, a state “fetal heartbeat” law that prohibits many abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy took effect when the US Supreme Court struck down Roe with its decision last June in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. But the law has been put on hold by a judge in Cincinnati.“These politicians know that their radical views on abortion care can’t win a fair vote, so they’re rigging the system,” Kellie Copeland, spokesperson for Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, said in a statement about the August special election.The group is pushing the November abortion-rights initiative.Supporters say the threshold should be raised to make it harder for deep-pocketed interest groups to push through changes to the constitution through the initiative process.The main sponsor of the effort to change the ballot initiative rules, Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart, did not immediately respond to a CNN interview request Thursday.He has pushed back on claims that increasing the threshold unfairly changes election ground rules.“If any outside group believes its ideas are worthy of inclusion in Ohio’s constitution, then they should be able to earn the widespread public support that a 60% vote margin will require,” Stewart said during floor debate Wednesday.Unions, abortion rights groups and voting rights activists have formed a coalition, called Vote No in August, to oppose raising the initiative threshold.",politics,0.0
423,447,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/prisoner-swap-russian-spies-biden-administration/index.html,Exclusive: Biden administration hunts for high-value Russians for potential prisoner swap,2023-05-11 15:41:00,"The Biden administration is scouring the globe for offers that could entice Russia to release two wrongfully detained Americans, Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, according to three sources familiar with the matter.The US does not currently have any high-level Russian spies in its custody, current and former US officials say, driving the need to turn to allies for help.The Biden administration is casting a wide net, approaching allied countries who have Russian spies in custody to gauge whether they would be willing to make a trade as part of a larger prisoner swap package. But US officials have also been surveying allies without Russians in their custody, officials said, for ideas on what might entice Moscow to release US prisoners.The White House is also exploring narrow sanctions relief, senior administration officials said.The goal is to bring home Whelan and Gershkovich as part of the same deal, US officials have said privately, with two US officials telling CNN the administration wants to see what creative offers could gin up Russian interest.US officials’ outreach extends to some countries that have recently arrested alleged Russian spies, including Brazil, Norway and Germany, as well as a former Soviet bloc country, to discuss the possibility of including them in any potential prisoner swaps. Germany has in its custody a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy agency named Vadim Krasikov, who is widely seen as being atop Russia’s list of prisoners it wants back.While some of these efforts predate Gershkovich’s detention, they have continued to intensify since The Wall Street Journal reporter was arrested in March, with White House officials directly engaged on the matter, officials said.“Efforts to reach out to allies and partners have been intense for many months and intensified even further once it became clear that there was no way to bring Whelan home at the same time as Brittney Griner, given Russian refusal to release Whelan,” said a senior administration official. “That recognition led the US government to redouble efforts with new creativity to find a way to bring Whelan home, too.”In March, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US had put forward a “serious proposal” to secure Whelan but that Russia had not engaged on it.Last April, the Biden administration",politics,0.0

I’m Kaitlan Collins.Tonight, President Trump is here as he embarks on a campaign unlike any other in the history of U.S. presidential elections. He’s the first former president in more than a century to seek a return to the White House. And he is currently leading the Republican field, while also facing multiple criminal investigations and an indictment.Just yesterday, he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation. No questions are off the table, and we agreed to no conditions. We’re here to give voters the answers that they deserve. Our audience is made up of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to take part in New Hampshire’s Republican primary.They will get the chance to question the former president directly. These voters and the issues that they care about the most will help decide if former President Trump will get a second chance to take on President Joe Biden.Please welcome the front-runner for the Republican nomination, former President Donald Trump.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.TRUMP:  Thank you.COLLINS:  How are you? Thank you for being here tonight.TRUMP:  How nice to see you.TRUMP:  Thank you.COLLINS:  You have got quite a crowd.TRUMP:  Thank you.COLLINS:  President Trump, thank you for your time here tonight.TRUMP:  Thank you.COLLINS:  We got a great crowd here in New Hampshire, a lot of voters with a lot of questions about what your 2024 term would look like, what another Trump term would look like.We will get to the voters shortly, but your polls show that you are dominating the Republican race right now, but you are also under active federal investigation for trying to overturn the 2020 election results. Your first term ended with a deadly riot at the Capitol, and you still have not publicly acknowledged the 2020 election results.Why should Americans put you back in the White House?TRUMP:  Because we did fantastically. We got 12 million more votes than we had in – as you know, in 2016. I actually say we did far better in that election, got the most that anybody’s ever gotten as a sitting president of the United States.I think that, when you look at that result and when you look at what happened during that election, unless you’re a very stupid person, you see what happens.A lot of the people – a lot of the people in this audience and perhaps maybe a couple that don’t, but most people understand what happened.That was a rigged election, and it’s a shame that we had to go through it. It’s very bad for our country. All over the world, they looked at it, and they saw exactly what everyone else saw. And you look – even if you just look recently with the 51 intelligence agents, that made a 16-point difference.If you look at the FBI…COLLINS:  But, Mr. President…TRUMP:  If you look at the FBI and Twitter – they call it Twitter Files – made a big difference.If you look at True the Vote…COLLINS:  Mr. President, back to what you just said there, though, it was not a rigged election. It was not a stolen election.You and your supporters lost more than 60 court cases on the election. And it’s been nearly two-and-a-half years. Can you publicly acknowledge that you did lose the 2020 election?TRUMP:  Now, let me – let me just go on.If you look at True the Vote, they found millions of votes on camera, on government cameras, where they were stuffing ballot boxes.So, with all of that, I think it’s a shame that – what happened. I think it’s a very sad thing for our country. I think it’s a very sad thing, frankly, for the world, because, if you look at what’s gone to our country, our country has gone to hell. Our borders are bad. Our military has been bad.You look at the taxes, you look at inflation, what’s happened to inflation, it’s just destroying our country. We have really become, in many ways, a Third World country. And it’s very sad what’s happened in this administration. And it’s something that we will turn around on day one.We were energy-independent. Now energy is at a level that we have never had to pay before. We – nobody can afford to continue to pay what’s happening with energy. But we were energy-independent. And we were getting out of Afghanistan with strength and with dignity. And, instead, we got out, we looked like fools…COLLINS:  And, Mr. President…TRUMP:  … probably the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.COLLINS:  We have a lot of questions about the economy and foreign policy tonight.TRUMP:  Good.COLLINS:  But what you just said there, Republican officials debunked those claims about fraudulent ballots.We want to give you a chance tonight…TRUMP:  Who? Who?COLLINS:  Republican officials in Georgia…TRUMP:  Who?COLLINS:  … and every single state. There is no – your own election officials, Mr. President.So, we wanted to give you a chance…TRUMP:  Look, people were afraid to take on the issue.But we have a big problem in this country. We have elections…COLLINS:  Well, we wanted to give you a chance to acknowledge the results.TRUMP:  We have elections that were horrible.If you look at what happened in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, if you look at what happened in Detroit, Michigan, if you look at what happened in Atlanta, millions of votes, and all you have to do is take a look at government cameras. You will see them, people going to 28 different voting booths to vote, to put in seven ballots apiece. I mean, and they’re all on camera.COLLINS:  But, Mr. President, I have to stop you there, because – because there is no evidence of that.Your own election officials testified to that and have said that. Republicans in these states did this. In Georgia, there were multiple recounts, including a hand recount.We have questions about the claims that you’re making tonight from voters on this topic.I want to bring in Scott Dustin from Concord. He works in insurance litigation. He is an undeclared voter. That’s what they call independents here in New Hampshire, as you know.TRUMP:  OK.COLLINS:  He did vote for you in 2020.Scott, what’s your question for the president?SCOTT DUSTIN, WORKS IN INSURANCE LITIGATION:  Hi, President Trump.TRUMP:  Hi, Scott.DUSTIN:  And welcome back to New Hampshire.TRUMP:  Thank you.DUSTIN:  Will you suspend polarizing talk of election fraud during your run for president?TRUMP:  Will I suspend – excuse me? What?DUSTIN:  Will you suspend polarizing talk of election fraud during your run for president?TRUMP:  Yes, unless I see election fraud.If I see election fraud, I think I have an obligation to say it. And what we went through a short while ago has really put our country in a big problem. I hope to do that. I hope we’re going to have very honest elections. We should have voter I.D. We should have one-day elections. We should have paper ballots, instead of these mail-in votes.But the answer is yes. And I hope that it’s going to be very straight-up, because, if it’s going to be straight-up, we’re going to win the election.Thank you.COLLINS:  So you will suspend talk, to his question, about the 2020 election on the campaign trail?TRUMP:  Well, I guess we’re going to just win. We’re at a point now. We’re getting so close. Let’s just win it again and straighten out our country.COLLINS:  One other question on this.COLLINS:  When you – when you have talked about the 2020 election results in the past, you once suggested terminating the Constitution.Do you stand by those comments?TRUMP:  No, no. You are able to do certain things. I’m not talking about terminating the Constitution. I’m talking about cherishing the Constitution.The Constitution says that we’re supposed to have legal and well-maintained and well-looked-at elections. And we didn’t have that. I cherish our Constitution, but we have to live up to the Constitution. We weren’t living up to the Constitution.COLLINS:  I would just say that there’s no evidence of that election fraud.You did once tweet…TRUMP:  I know you’re supposed to say that, but – you know, I’m glad you say that.But, look…COLLINS:  It’s the truth, Mr. President.TRUMP:  … that was a horrible election.TRUMP:  That was a horrible election. And unless somebody is very stupid – and I know you very well. You’re not stupid at all. But you perhaps are given an agenda, or you have an agenda.Look, we have to have honest elections in our country. We have open borders. We have…TRUMP:  You look at what’s happening.I mean, we have elections. We have open borders. Look at what’s happening on our Southern border. Millions and millions of people are coming here. They’re being released from prisons. They’re being released from mental institutions. And we have millions of people pouring into our country. And now they’re getting rid of Title 42, which I put on, which kept people out that were sick and had problems.COLLINS:  And, Mr. President, we have a lot of questions about immigration to get to tonight.TRUMP:  Yes.COLLINS:  Obviously, that’s a big topic, especially given what’s expected to happen tomorrow.But I want to talk about the influence you have over your voters. It’s very clear that you are very influential over them. You have a lot of impact. I have been to many of your rallies and seen it up close, which raised a lot of questions about the influence that we saw that you had on them on January 6 and your supporters when they attacked the Capitol.Do you have any regrets about your actions on January 6?TRUMP:  Well, you know, January 6 was – again, we go back to it, but January 6 had to do with the fact that hundreds of thousands of people – and you don’t see the pictures very often.A lot of the people here probably were there. January 6, it was the largest crowd I have ever spoken to. That was prior to the walk down to the Capitol Building. I don’t think – and I have spoken to hundreds of thousands of people. I have never spoken to a crowd as large as this.And that was because they thought the election was rigged. And they were there proud. They were there with love in their heart. That was an unbelievable – and it was a beautiful day. And what I was asked to do – I wasn’t involved in it very much. I was asked to come in. Would I make a speech?I made a speech. I said, walk peacefully and patriotically, many different things. In fact, I brought a list of things. I don’t want to bore the audience, but we can go sentence after sentence after sentence of things I said and things I put out.One of the big problems was that Nancy Pelosi, crazy Nancy, as I affectionately call her…TRUMP:  … crazy Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington were in charge, as you know, of security, and they did not do their job.COLLINS:  They’re not in charge of the National Guard. You’re in charge of the National Guard.TRUMP:  They are in charge. Well, I offered them National Guard. I said, we will give you soldiers. We will give you National Guard. We will give you whatever you want.And they turned me down. And, in fact, she turned me down.COLLINS:  Your acting defense secretary…TRUMP:  She turned – excuse me – she turned me down in writing. They turned me down.COLLINS:  But your acting defense secretary, Chris Miller, at the time, he says you never gave a formal order to deploy the National Guard.But, when it came that day…TRUMP:  Excuse me. Just the opposite.COLLINS:  He test…TRUMP:  Chris Miller wrote a book, and he’s a fantastic guy, and he was ready to go. They turned him down.If you look, the mayor of Washington, D.C., lovely lady, she said, we don’t want it. We don’t like the look. Nancy Pelosi said, oh, we don’t like the look.If they would have had just – I offered them 10,000 soldiers. I said it could be 10,000. It could be more. But I offered them specifically 10,000 soldiers. If they would have taken 500 soldiers, you wouldn’t have had the problem. They turned it down.And if you look at the inspector general report, he says they turned it down. They made a terrible mistake.COLLINS:  Well, Chris Miller was your acting defense secretary. He says you never gave that order.But back to what happened on that day, he said you weren’t…TRUMP:  He did not say that.COLLINS:  You – he has testified that, Mr. President.TRUMP:  He did not say that.COLLINS:  But you said you weren’t very involved that day.You did tell your supporters to come to Washington. You tweeted about it, about that speech…TRUMP:  That’s true, of course.COLLINS:  … that happened on the rally. So, when they…TRUMP:  Am I allowed to say that?COLLINS:  When they went to the Capitol and they were breaking into the Capitol, smashing windows, injuring police officers, why did you – why did it take you three hours to tell them to go home?TRUMP:  I don’t believe it did. Oh, let me pull it out. I have to pull it out.TRUMP:  So – so, if you look at – on January 5, the day before, I said: “Please support our Capitol Police and law enforcement. They are truly on the side of our country. Stay peaceful. Stay peaceful.”This was the day before. And this was in the form of Twitter. Now I use TRUTH, TRUTH Social. I think it’s far superior, OK?TRUMP:  I hope everybody’s on – I hope everybody’s on TRUTH.If you look, January 6, this is at 2:00 – before 2:30. “I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful.” This is right after – as it was happening. But what happened is, they took it down. I don’t know why. I think they took it down because it was so good. They didn’t like it being up there.TRUMP: “I am asking” – this is – and we didn’t know until I got it back, because now I have 90 million people waiting for me to go back.But I’m on TRUTH, and I’m staying on TRUTH.Listen, “I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol remain peaceful. No violation.” It’s we want “no violation. We want no violence. Remember, we are the party of law and order. Respect the law and our great men and women in blue. Thank you.”That was at 2:30. That was very early.COLLINS:  Mr. President, I looked at the same timeline that you did.Once it was clear…TRUMP:  No, I know, but you didn’t report that. You know why? Because it was taken down.COLLINS:  We did report it. I was reporting that day.TRUMP:  It was taken down, and it wasn’t put back up.COLLINS:  But when it was clear to you that they were not being peaceful – you saw them rushing the Capitol, breaking windows. They were hitting officers with flagpoles, Tasing them, beating them up.When it was clear they weren’t being peaceful, why did you wait three hours to tell them to leave the Capitol? They listen to you like no one else.TRUMP:  Yes.COLLINS:  You know that.TRUMP:  They do. I agree with that.But Nancy Pelosi…COLLINS:  So, why didn’t you tell them to go home sooner?TRUMP:  Nancy Pelosi and the mayor are in charge. I assumed they were able to do their job. They weren’t.COLLINS:  But Pelosi is not in charge of Capitol security.TRUMP:  And it kicked in.And, if you remember, I made a video right outside the Oval Office in the Rose Garden. And I’m very proud of that video. I didn’t have a script. I don’t need scripts, like a certain person that’s in there right now.COLLINS:  But what time – the video, it came out much later, after they had already attacked the Capitol.TRUMP:  It’s right there. It’s right…TRUMP:  It was a great video. And it was a beautiful video.And it said – I mean, I don’t want to read it all, but you have – “You have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people of law and order. We love the people of law and order. We can’t play into the hands of these other people. We have to have peace. Please go home.”I said that. You know what they did?COLLINS:  Well, referring to the law and order there, Mr. President…TRUMP:  They took that down. And, you know, to this day, it hasn’t been put up.And the reason is, it’s so good and so conclusive that all of this nonsense and all of the tens of millions of dollars that have been spent are just wiped away with this one, and they have never put it back up. They had another one that they did the same thing.COLLINS:  But that video that you referenced there, it wasn’t posted until 4:17 p.m.TRUMP:  No, I will tell you…COLLINS:  They breached the Capitol at 2:00 p.m., Mr. President.TRUMP:  That video was posted…COLLINS:  4:17 p.m.TRUMP:  Yes, before – actually, a little bit before that.COLLINS:  Right. So, that’s my question.TRUMP:  But – excuse me.COLLINS:  Because, in that three hours, over 140 officers were injured.TRUMP:  Excuse me. It was posted after the first one I just read, though, and that was at 2:00.COLLINS:  But I think the reason the timeline is so critical here, because, going back to your influence, in that three hours…TRUMP:  There’s another one I post.COLLINS:  … over 140 officers were injured that day.TRUMP:  And a person named Ashli Babbitt was killed.COLLINS:  Yes.TRUMP:  You know what? She was killed, and she shouldn’t have been killed.And that thug that killed her, there was no reason to shoot her at blank range. Cold, blank range, they shot her. And she was a good person. She was a patriot.COLLINS:  One person who was there…TRUMP:  And there was no reason. There was no reason.And he went on television to brag about the fact that he killed her.TRUMP: She was a patriot. There was no reason –COLLINS: One person who was there –TRUMP: – there was no reason. And he went on television to brag about the fact that he killed her.COLLINS: That officer was not bragging about the fact that he killed her.TRUMP: Oh, he was bragging.COLLINS: But one person who was at the Capitol that day, as you know, was your vice president, Mike Pence, who says that you endangered his life on that day. Do you feel –TRUMP: I don’t think he was in any danger.COLLINS: Mr. President, do you feel that you owe him an apology?TRUMP: No, because he did something wrong. He should have put the votes back to the state legislatures and I think we would have had a different outcome. I really do.COLLINS: But he doesn’t have the authority to do that as you know.TRUMP: What?COLLINS: The vice president doesn’t have the authority to reject those – those electoral results.TRUMP: Okay, are you ready? Let’s have this now, just now, because it’s interest – let’s keep it interesting, right?I like Mike Pence very much. He’s a very fine man. He’s a very nice man. He made a mistake.His lawyer said, you cannot move. I call them the human conveyer belt. I said, even if the votes you mean – I talked to his lawyer – even if the votes are absolutely fraudulent, he can’t send – yes, sir, he can’t send them back. And the Democrats played it and the RINOs played it.And then, the election was over. They told them he couldn’t do it. And Mike said to me, I can’t do it. The lawyers told me I can’t do it, they can’t do it.But the lawyers were wrong because right after the election, they all met, the RINOs and the Democrats, and they worked out a plan to make sure that future vice presidents don’t do what I said you could do.COLLINS: That’s not what happened. You’re referring to the Electoral Count Act.TRUMP: That’s exactly –COLLINS: I’ve read – I’ve read that. There is – there is no authority.TRUMP: No, excuse me –COLLINS: Legal experts, including Republican legal experts, say that he does not have that authority, Mr. President.But I want to move on –TRUMP: Kaitlan, why did they change the law then saying that you can’t do it?COLLINS: They didn’t change the law. They strengthened the law because they are worried about a president exploiting –TRUMP: Oh, they strengthened it, meaning you could do it. Thank you.COLLINS: That’s not what it means.TRUMP: Thank you.COLLINS: They strengthened the law –TRUMP: Mike had the right to do it. They convinced him he didn’t, and it was a horrible thing for our country.If you would have sent those votes back to Georgia, Pennsylvania, and other states – Wisconsin, which if you look at Wisconsin, they virtually admitted now that the election was rigged.COLLINS: They have not admitted that, Mr. President.TRUMP: If you sent the votes back to many of those states, they would not come back in the affirmative, and remember what I said, and you just said it pretty much. You admitted what I said was right.COLLINS: I did not.TRUMP: They said he didn’t have the right to do it, and he did have the right to do it, and that’s why they changed the law taking that right away.COLLINS: I should note that your campaign paid for a recount that happened in Wisconsin and actually had more votes for President Biden by the end of it.But I want to move on to Wayne Beyer. He’s a retired attorney for North Conway –TRUMP: By the way, so many illegal votes were cast in Wisconsin. And if you look in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, they had so many legal – illegal votes, they didn’t even know what to do with them. You’re absolutely wrong about that.COLLINS: Mr. President, there weren’t any fraudulent votes in Wisconsin.I do want to get to the audience and we have questions from the audience.A retired – Wayne Beyer is a retired attorney from North Conway. He’s previously served in Republican administrations. He volunteered for the Republican Party in the 2022 midterms. He voted for you in 2020.What’s your question for the president, Wayne?WAYNE BEYER, RETIRED ATTORNEY: Thank you for coming, Mr. President.TRUMP: Thank you, Wayne.BEYER: My question to you is: will you pardon the January 6th rioters who were convicted of federal offenses?TRUMP: I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can’t say for every single one because a couple of them, probably, they got out of control.But, you know, when you look at Antifa, what they’ve done to Portland, and if you look at Antifa, look at what they’ve done to Minneapolis and so many other – so many other places, look at what they did to Seattle. And BLM – BLM, many people were killed.These people – I’m not trying to justify anything, but you have two standards of justice in this country, and what they’ve done – and I love that question because what they’ve done to see many people is nothing – nothing. And then what they’ve done to these people, they’ve persecuted these people.And yeah, my answer is I am most likely – if I get in, I will most likely – I would say it will be a large portion of them. You know, they did a very –And it’ll be very early on. And they’re living in hell right now.COLLINS: So when it comes to pardons –TRUMP: They’re living in hell, and they’re policemen, and they’re firemen, and they’re soldiers, and they’re carpenters and electricians and they’re great people. Many of them are just great people.COLLINS: Mr. President, one of the people who was convicted was a former policeman but he was convicted of attacking a police officer, I should note.But when you said you are considering pardoning a large portion of those charged with crimes on January 6th, does that include the four Proud Boys members who were charged and convicted of seditious conspiracy?TRUMP: I don’t know. I’ll have to look at their case, but I will say in Washington, D.C., you cannot get a fair trial, you cannot. Just like in New York City, you can’t get a fair trial either.COLLINS: Speaking of New York, I want to ask you about a significant verdict that was reached yesterday. I know this is something you want to weigh in on as well.A Manhattan jury found –TRUMP: Sure.COLLINS: – that you sexually abused the writer E. Jean Carroll and defamed her.You’ve denied this.But what do you say to voters who say it disqualifies you from being president?TRUMP: Well, there weren’t too many of them because my poll numbers just came out. They went up, okay?I think – I think I’m – I’m the only person in history who had a charge like that, and usually you leave office and you say, I’m sorry but I’m going to back home – I’m back home to my family and everything. I’m going to be resigned.My poll numbers went up and they went up with the other fake charge, too, because what’s happening is they’re doing this for election interference.This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is. I had a picture taken years ago with her and her husband, nice guy John Johnson.He was a newscaster, very nice man. She called him an ape, happens to be African-American. Called him an ape – the judge wouldn’t allow us to put that in.Her dog or her cat was named vagina, the judge wouldn’t allow to put that in. All these things, he – but with her, they can put in anything, “Access Hollywood” –COLLINS: This was a jury of nine people who found you –TRUMP: That’s right.COLLINS: – liable of sexual abuse. Do you think that – that will deter women from voting for you?TRUMP: No, I don’t think so because I think the whole thing – just so you understand – ready?I never met this woman. I never saw this woman. This woman said I met her at the front door of Bergdorf Goodman which I never go into other than for a couple of charities. I met her in the front door. She was about 60 years. This is like 22, 23 years ago.I met her in the front door of Bergdorf Goodman. I was immediately attracted to her and she was immediately attracted to me. And we had this great chemistry.We’re walking into a crowded department store. We had this great chemistry. And a few minutes later, we end up in a room, a dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman, right near the cash register.And then she found out that there were locks in the door. She said, I found one that was open. She found one, she learned this at trial. She found one that was open.What kind of a woman meet somebody and brings them up and within minutes, you’re playing hanky-panky in a dressing room, okay? I don’t know if she was married then or not. John Johnson, I feel sorry for you, John Johnson.COLLINS: Mr. President, can I – can I ask you this?TRUMP: Think of it, think of this –COLLINS: I know you’re recounting what you said but, Mr. President –TRUMP: But let me just, if I could because you asked a question.COLLINS: This was a jury though –TRUMP: Just so you understand, because I was walking in at a department – because I was very famous then and I owned the Plaza Hotel right next door and I owned the buildings around it. I’m not going into a dressing room of a crowded department store.Then I say, if she was being raped – and by the way, they said she wasn’t raped, okay? That was her charge. It wasn’t –COLLINS: They found that you sexually abused her.TRUMP: Oh, that was – say what the – they didn’t – they said he didn’t rape her.COLLINS: They did not say –TRUMP: And I didn’t do anything else either. You know what? Because I have no idea who the hell she is. I don’t know who this woman is.COLLINS: But, Mr. President, can I – can I ask you given your recounting and your version –TRUMP: I don’t know who – and I tell you this. Are you ready?COLLINS: But, Mr. President, can I – can I ask you because –TRUMP: And I swear on my children, which I never do. I have no idea who this woman. This is a fake story, made up story.We had a horrible Clinton-appointed judge. He was horrible. He allowed her to put everything in. He allowed us to put nothing in. This is a fake story.COLLINS: Mr. President, you’re recounting your version of events here right now to the audience. You reference the trial. You did not go to the trial and actually testify.TRUMP: That’s right.COLLINS: Do you wish that you had testified?TRUMP: No, it wouldn’t have made a difference. This is rigged deal. This was a – my lawyer said, sir, you don’t have to do it.I actually said, I think I should, it would be disrespectful. They said, sir, don’t do it. This is fake story and you don’t want to give it credibility.COLLINS: One thing you –TRUMP: That’s why I didn’t go.COLLINS: One thing you did do in this –TRUMP: And I swear and I’ve never done that, and I swear to – I have no idea who the hell – she’s a whack job.COLLINS: Mr. President, you did not testify in person in this trial. There was a taped deposition of you from October, and in it, you defended the comments that you made on that “Access Hollywood” tape about being able to grab women how you want. Do you stand by those comments?TRUMP: I said if you’re famous and rich or whatever I said, but I said if you’re a star, you are – and I said women let you. I didn’t say you grab. I said women let. You know you didn’t use that word, but if you look, women let you.Now, they said will you take that back? I said, look, for a million years, this is the way it’s been. I want to be honest. This is the way it’s been. I can take it back if you’d like to.But if you’re a famous person, if you’re a star – and I’m not referring to myself. I’m saying people that are famous, people that are stars.COLLINS: But you were asked in a deposition if you consider yourself to be a star and you said yes.TRUMP: People that are rich, people that are powerful, they tend to do pretty well in a lot of different ways, okay?And you would like me to take that back. I can’t take it back because it happens to be true. I’ve said it’s been true for one million years, approximately a million years, perhaps a little bit longer than that.COLLINS: So you standby those comments?TRUMP: I don’t want to lie. Oh, here’s what – here’s what she wants me to say.COLLINS: Mr. President, let’s get to the audience questions tonight.TRUMP: A rich and famous person has no advantage over anyone else. Well, you do have an advantage, and I say unfortunately, but that’s the way it is.COLLINS: You said unfortunately or fortunately.TRUMP: Well, fortunately or unfortunately for her.COLLINS: But, Mr. President, we have a lot of audience questions to get to tonight. I want to go back to the audience.We’ve got Danielle Reger. She works as an oral surgery assistant. She’s a Republican activist from Derry. She was a New Hampshire delegate for you in 2020.What’s your question?DANIELLE REGER, ORAL SURGERY ASSISTANT: Hi, thank you so much for coming to New Hampshire to answer our questions.TRUMP: Thank you.REGER: My question is regarding the economy.Over the past two years, we have seen the prices for everything skyrocket, from food to gas to utilities and insurance costs. Many peoples’ bills are up several hundred dollars a month, including mine.If elected president, again, what is the first thing you would do to help bring down the cost to make things more affordable?TRUMP: Drill, baby, drill.TRUMP: Well, we were energy independent. We were soon going to be energy dominant.And nobody had ever done what I did. We got oil down to $1.87. Actually, it fell lower than that in some cases. We’d have to save the oil companies – the price was getting.So, we were doing incredibly. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country, probably the greatest economy in the history of the world.We’re energy independent, soon to be energy dominant. We were going to be bigger than Russia and Saudi Arabia put together times two. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation – any other nation.And these stupid fools ended it. And energy went from $1.87 and even lower for gasoline, for a car. They went from $1.87 to $5, $6, $7, $8 and even $9, and your electricity bills went through the roof. Your heating bills went through the roof.And that’s what started inflation. And it hasn’t stopped because people are paying now for bacon and for eggs and for the – two and three times what it was just a little while ago.We created the greatest economy in history. A big part of that economy was I get – I got you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, bigger than the Reagan cuts, bigger than any –TRUMP: And also, Kaitlan, also, as you know, we got the biggest regulation and regulatory cuts.We – this place was rocking, and then we were given a gift from China. And China paid a big price. And let me tell you something, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes from China.But prior to COVID coming in – and then I rebuilt the economy again a second time. But we had prior to COVID coming in as – from China, from Wuhan, which I said it came from Wuhan, and everybody said, oh, you’re wrong about that. You’re wrong. It came from Wuhan. I said it right from day one.So we had the greatest economy in the world, is historic. They made energy so high, and energy is all invasive. It is massive as an industry and as a cost. It lifted everything.COLLINS: Mr. President, staying on the economy –TRUMP: If you made do – if you made donuts, if you made – no matter what you did, and we had inflation the likes of which – I guess we have, as you said, for 52 years, but I think more than that, we had no inflation, we had the lowest energy prices we’ve had in decades. This country was rocking and rolling.And by the way, we had the most secure border in the history of our country and now we have –COLLINS: Mr. President, we have – we have more questions on the economy. I want to make sure we get to all of those.As you know, the U.S. could be three weeks away from defaulting on its debt. There could be millions of jobs lost, people not getting their Social Security payments. We believe it’d put the U.S. into a recession.On that topic, I want to bring in Marta Saravia, a student here at Saint Anselm. She’s an undeclared voter who did not vote in 2020.Marta, what’s your question?MARTA SARAVIA, SAINT ANSELM COLLEGE STUDENT: Hi, Mr. President.TRUMP: Hi. Thank you.SARAVIA: So, my question is, what do you think about the United States current debt situation, and how can we move forward?TRUMP: Such an important question. So we’re at $33 trillion, a number that nobody ever thought possible.When we had our economy rocking and rolling just prior to COVID coming in, like literally, we were making a fortune. And oil, we were going to make so much money from oil, we were going to start paying off debt.But then with COVID coming in, we had to do other things. We had to keep this country alive because it was so serious. But we have to get the country back.We have to lower energy prices. We have to lower interest rates. Interest rates are through the roof. Energy has to come down, it all has to come down and we have to start paying off debt.But when we have a debt limit, and they use that very seriously. I mean, they came in – Schumer came in with Nancy Pelosi, and they were using, we’ll violate it, we’ll do whatever – they talked a whole lot different than they do right now.I say to the Republicans out there – congressmen, senators – if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default. And I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen. But it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors. You know the expression?COLLINS: So, just to be clear, Mr. President, you think the U.S. should default if the White House does not agree to the spending cuts Republicans are demanding?TRUMP: Well, you might as well do it now because you’ll do it later, because we have –TRUMP:  Well, you might as well do it now because you’ll do it later. Because we have to save this country. Our country is dying. Our country is being destroyed by stupid people, by very stupid people.COLLINS:  You once said that using the – that using the debt ceiling as a negotiating wedge just could not happen. You – you said that when you were in the Oval Office.TRUMP:  Sure, that’s when I was president.COLLINS:  So why is it different now that you’re out of office?TRUMP:  Because now I’m not president.COLLINS:  The U.S. defaulting would be massively consequential…TRUMP:  Well, you don’t know…COLLINS:  … for everyone in this room, for all Americans.TRUMP:  You don’t know.  It’s psychological.  It’s really psychological more than anything else. And it could be very bad.  It could be, maybe, nothing. Maybe it’s – you have a bad week or a bad day, but, look, you have to cut your costs. We’re – we’re spending $7 trillion on – much of it on nonsense – $7 trillion on nonsense.COLLINS:  We’ve got another question from a voter tonight.TRUMP:  I actually said get all of that money that was wasted and, frankly, the Senate should have never approved it. Get all that money that was wasted. And if they don’t get rid of that, you’ll have to default.COLLINS:  Mr. President…TRUMP:  OK?  You’ll have to default.COLLINS:  Mr. President, we’ve got another voter here tonight…TRUMP:  And, by the way, you’re going to default eventually, anyway, but it’s going to be much messier. I don’t think you’ll have to default. I think, if the Republicans hold strong and they say “We want five” – let’s say, “We want $5 trillion off,” I really think the Democrats have no choice but to do it. And if I win, they’re going to be doing the same thing to me in two years, I guarantee you that. They’re going to play a very hardball game…COLLINS:  Mr. President, we’ve got another voter here tonight…TRUMP:  … and they did that before.COLLINS:  Bobby Petrino has been waiting very patiently. He’s a student at Saint Anselm. He’s a member of College Republicans.  He’s an undeclared voter right now. He supported you in 2020.Bobby, what’s your question for President Trump?QUESTION:  Hi, thank you for coming. This is a bit of a pivot. But, with gun violence and mass shootings in the news cycle recently, I’m worried that state governments and the federal government are going to act to repress gun rights. Under your administration, you instructed the Department of Justice and the ATF to ban bump stocks. If elected president again, how would you act not only to defend our second amendment rights but to restore rights that have been taken from us such as, by example, recently, the ATF’s ruling on the pistol-stabilizing braces?TRUMP:  Yeah, as you know, the bump stocks are actually a very unimportant thing. And NRA, I went with them, and they said it doesn’t mean anything. Actually, all they do is teach you how to shoot very inaccurately. So we did that.There’s been nobody that’s protected the second amendment, as you know, like I have. I’ve protected it through thick and thin, not easy to do.  But we have a very big mental health problem in this country. And again, it’s not the gun that pulls the trigger; it’s the person that pulls the trigger. And we have to protect our second amendment.We have to protect our Second Amendment.COLLINS:  Mr. President, you dealt with a lot of mass shootings when you were in office. This year there have already been more than 200 mass shootings in 2023.TRUMP:  Yeah.COLLINS:  If you are re-elected, are there any new gun restrictions that you would sign into law?TRUMP:  I would do numerous things. For instance, schools, we would harden, very – very much harden – and I also, I’m a very believer – I believe in teachers; I love teachers. I think they’re incredible, and they love the children – not quite like the parents, but they love the children, in many cases, almost as much.Many of these teachers are soldiers, ex-soldiers, ex-policemen. They’re people that really understand weapons. And you don’t need – 5 percent of the teachers would be more than you could ever have if you’re going to hire security guards.  But in addition to that, have security guards. You have to harden your entrances. You have to make schools safe.And you can make other places safe. But it is a big mental health problem in this country more than anything else. And remember, we have 700 million guns – 700 million.  Many people, if they don’t have a gun, they’re not going to be very safe. I mean, if they don’t have a gun – it gives them security. Now, you need them for entertainment; you need them for hunting; you need them for a lot of different things. But there are people that, if they didn’t have the privilege of having a gun in some form, they – many of them would not be alive today. You know, there’s a certain country that had a very strict policy on guns, very, very strict.COLLINS:  Which country?TRUMP:  Brazil. OK, Brazil, very strict. And the former president of Brazil – and the killing was incredible. They were walking into people’s homes and killing people. They had no protection. He said, “Go out and buy guns.” People went out and bought guns, and it went way down. The numbers went way down because they had security.If you look at Chicago, Chicago has the singles toughest gun policies in the nation.  They are so tough, you can’t breathe; New York, too, and other places also.  All of those places are the worst and most dangerous places.  So that’s not the answer.COLLINS:  So no new restrictions that you would sign if re-elected, Mr. President.I want you to meet Julie Miles, a registered nurse from Merrimack.  She’s a Republican who voted for you in 2020.Julie, what’s your question for the president?QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. President.TRUMP:  Thank you.QUESTION:  I appreciate you answering this question this evening.  How do you plan to appeal to women voters in New Hampshire who are concerned about the Dobbs decision and how states may change their laws?TRUMP:  It’s such a great question, and it was such a great victory.  And people are starting to understand it now.  You know that they wanted to bring it back to the states, but that was probably the least important part of that victory.  Getting rid of Roe v. Wade was an incredible thing for pro-life because it gave pro-life something to negotiate with.  Pro-life had absolutely nothing, being stuck in Roe v. Wade to negotiate with.  And now what’s happening, and I see it all over, deals are being made; deals are going to (inaudible) look, everybody that was president wanted to get rid, and tried to get rid of Roe v. Wade.COLLINS:  You mean Republicans?TRUMP:  For 50 years – Republicans.  For 50 years this has been going on – actually a couple of Democrats, too.  But for 50 years, this has been going on.  I was able to do it, and I was very honored to do it.  But by doing it, things are happening that are very, very positive.And you have to – I happen to believe in the exceptions, the life of the mother, rape, incest, like Ronald Reagan believed in the exceptions.  But I happen to believe that.  I think it – I think it’s frankly important to do that, but a lot of people are, you know, against that – a relatively small – relatively small number, but the way I – the way I look at it…COLLINS:  So let me ask you…TRUMP:  I think it’s very important to say this.  I consider the other side to be radical.  Because the other side, under Roe v. Wade and other things, the other side, they’re radical.  Because they will – remember the debate with Hillary Clinton?  And I said, “Rip the baby out of the womb at the end of the ninth month, they will kill the baby in the ninth month.”  If you look at that crazy governor of Virginia from – the former governor, where he said, “No, the baby will be born and then we’ll decide,” essentially whether or not to execute the baby.COLLINS:  But, Mr. President, can we talk about what you would do…TRUMP:  No, but these are the radical people.COLLINS:  … if you are re-elected…TRUMP:  It’s not the pro-life people that are radical…COLLINS:  But if you are re-elected…TRUMP:  It’s these people.COLLINS:  … and you’re back in the Oval Office, and you get legislation to your desk, would you sign a federal abortion ban into law?TRUMP:  What I will do is negotiate so that people are happy.  But the fact that we were able – I was able – I’m so proud of it.  We put three great justices on the Supreme Court.  We have almost 300 federal judges on the Supreme Court.COLLINS:  So you – just to be clear – just to be clear, Mr. President, you – you would sign a federal abortion ban into law?TRUMP:  Well, I said this.  I said this.  I want to do what’s right.  And we’re looking.  And we want to do what’s right for everybody.COLLINS:  But what’s right?TRUMP:  But now, for the first time, the people that are pro-life have negotiating capability, because you didn’t have it before.  They could kill the baby in the ninth month or after the baby was born.  Now they won’t be able to do that.COLLINS:  But I think this is a really important question for you to answer because this is something every Republican, including those who are running against you for the nomination, are being asked about, is would you sign a federal abortion ban into law?TRUMP:  Well, and many of them are going to give you the same answer as I – I am.  First of all, I am honored to have done what I did, and a lot of people said – they said, “In 150 years, he’s now the most consequential president because he saved so many lives.”  And I’m honored to have done it.TRUMP:  And – and because of what I’ve done, we now have a great negotiating ability.  That’s what I do in life.  I negotiate.  We have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done.COLLINS:  But what do you mean “negotiating ability?”  Because the question that Republicans have, and some of your allies on Capitol Hill say that they want to introduce legislation when it comes to banning abortion.  If they send it to your desk, would you sign it?TRUMP:  Some people are at six weeks; some people are at three weeks, two weeks.COLLINS:  Where’s President Trump?TRUMP:  President Trump is going to make a determination what he thinks is great for the country and what’s fair for the country.  But the fact that I was able to terminate Roe v. Wade, after 50 years of trying – they worked for 50 years.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  They worked – and I was even – I was so honored to have done it.  We are in a very good negotiating position right now, only because of what I was able to do.And remember this, again, you talk about radicalism.  People that will kill a baby in the ninth month or the eighth month or the seventh month, or after the baby is born, they’re the radicals, not the pro-life people.COLLINS:  I just want to give you one more chance, though, because you did not answer whether or not you’d sign a federal abortion ban or how many weeks into pregnancy you believe abortion should be banned.TRUMP:  Yeah, but I’ve given you…COLLINS:  Can you answer either of those tonight?TRUMP:  I’ve given you the answer probably four times already.COLLINS:  Which one is it, then?TRUMP:  I’m looking – I’m looking…COLLINS:  You haven’t answered it.TRUMP:  … at a solution that’s going to work – very complex issue for the country. You have people on both sides of an issue.  But we are now in a very strong position. Pro-life people are in a strong position to make a deal that’s going to be good and going to be satisfactory for them.If you weren’t able to get rid of – you wouldn’t even be having a discussion if you weren’t able to get rid of Roe v. Wade, which put pro-life in a dead position, a horrible position. They could kill the baby at any time they wanted to. But we did something that nobody thought was do-able. And other Republican presidents, and others, by the way, they wanted to get it out. They also wanted to bring it back to the states.  But bringing it back to the states is a less important issue…COLLINS:  But that’s why it’s…TRUMP:  … than the issue that we just talked about.COLLINS:  the question about a federal abortion ban. You did not say yes or no to that. You did not say how many weeks…TRUMP:  It depends what – it depends what the deal is. Lindsey Graham’s a good man.COLLINS:  You did not say how many weeks.TRUMP:  He’s got an idea.  And a lot of other people have an idea. And I look at all the…COLLINS:  And a lot of people will be curious what your idea…TRUMP:  I’ll make the right decision…COLLINS:  … is on that.President Trump, we’ve got more questions to come for you tonight.TRUMP:  Yeah, I’ll make the right decision…COLLINS:  We’ll be right back…TRUMP:  … for the country.COLLINS:  … in just a moment.COLLINS:  Welcome back to CNN’s Republican presidential town hall with former President Donald Trump.President Trump, I’d like you to meet Jennifer Simmons.  She is a stay-at-home mom and former town selectman from Windham. She’s Republican, and she voted for you in 2020.Jennifer, what’s your question tonight?QUESTION:  Good evening, Mr. President.TRUMP:  Thank you.QUESTION:  Title 42 is expected to expire tomorrow. Our southern border and now our northern border are experiencing record migration.  We learned on May 2nd that the Biden administration plans on deploying 1,500 troops to the southern border.Do you agree with deploying troops to the border?  And how will a Trump administration slow down the rate of migrants coming across all our borders?TRUMP:  Sure, a very fair question, especially since tomorrow is going to be a day of infamy. You’re going to have tens of thousands of people pouring into our country. Even the judge, you know, the judge overruled them when they wanted to terminate it early. And he said, do you know that you better extend this thing. The judge in Texas said, I hope you’re going to extend this.But this is my policy that they’re letting terminate because they lost in court. They wanted to go earlier. You’re going to have millions of people pouring into our country right now at a level that nobody has ever seen before. These people are sick. Anybody that wants this to happen to our country, they’re destroying our country. And this should not be allowed to happen, how they’re not going to do a version of Title 42 or my Title 42, which was tough.If people are sick and have infectious diseases and lots of other problems, we don’t want them being into our country. We have enough problems right now. We have problems like we’ve never had in the history of our country. Our country–COLLINS: But, Mr. President–TRUMP: Our country is being–COLLINS: – the reason it’s ending–TRUMP: – destroyed.COLLINS: The reason it’s ending is because the health policy, the COVID-era pandemic emergency is coming to an end. That’s what Title 42 was. You put it in place because of COVID.TRUMP: That’s true, but you have–COLLINS: When it comes to big questions about what your immigration policy would look like if you are re-elected, some of your Republican rivals have criticized you for not fulfilling the promises that you made on the campaign trail like finishing the border wall. So how do voters know that you would get those done if you’re re-elected?TRUMP: I did finish the wall. I built a wall. I built–COLLINS: You didn’t finish the wall.TRUMP: – hundreds of miles of wall. And I finished it. And then I said, we have to build some more because there are areas like water going through a dam. There are some areas where a lot of people are coming. You close up one and they come into another. And we started another 100 miles of wall. In fact, I said to my people, if we start this and don’t finish it, and then we had a rigged election, I’m sorry to say it. And–COLLINS: The election was not rigged, Mr. President.TRUMP: Oh, OK, good, I know. I’m–COLLINS: You can’t keep saying that all night long.TRUMP: I’m glad you’re saying that. And so then–COLLINS: You cannot keep saying the election–TRUMP: – they took over and–COLLINS: – was rigged.TRUMP: – they decided not to finish it. It would have taken them three weeks. I’ve built hundreds of miles of wall. If we didn’t have it, it would be – hard to believe it could be any worse, they’re just letting people flow into our country.Look, a country has to have borders. There’s never been anything like is happening to our country right now.COLLINS: You built about 52 miles of new wall when you were in office–TRUMP: You see this?COLLINS: – Mr. President. It wasn’t the complete wall. One other thing that – with immigration–TRUMP: No, but I have to respond to that.COLLINS: With your immigration – it was only about 52 miles–TRUMP: OK. Can I respond?COLLINS: – of new wall.TRUMP: This is what she does.TRUMP: I built hundreds of miles. Some of the wall was up there, and it would be laying on the ground, rusted rotten steel, rusted rotten wood. A little – and what the radical left crazy Democrats did, if there’s a piece of wood laying down, they consider that a wall. I built 30-foot walls that go down seven feet into the ground. If there was a little piece of wood sitting in the ground, they said, oh, he’s not building a wall, we already had a wall. Because this is the game. They’re a party of disinformation.COLLINS: It’s not a game, Mr. President. It’s about 52 miles of new wall. One other immigration policy–TRUMP: No, no–COLLINS: – you had when you were–TRUMP: – they – I built new wall.COLLINS: – in office–TRUMP: I built new wall.COLLINS: Fifth-two miles of–TRUMP: For hundreds of miles.COLLINS: CBP, Mr. President.TRUMP: What I did is I replaced other wall that was laying down, that was up and rotting in the ground for 30 years. Some of it was steel that you couldn’t even say it was steel.COLLINS: Mr. President, it was only about 52 miles of new wall. But moving on, another immigration policy you had was the zero-tolerance immigration policy that separated families at the border. If you are re-elected, are you ruling out instituting that?TRUMP: Well, when you have that policy, people don’t come. If a family hears they’re going to be separated, they love their family, they don’t come. So I know it sounds harsh, but if you remember, remember they said I was building prisons for children? It turned out that it was Obama that was building the prisons–COLLINS: But would you–TRUMP: – for the children.COLLINS: – re – re-implement that if you’re re-elected? Is that what you’re saying?TRUMP: Well, here’s – we have to save our country, all right? We can’t afford–COLLINS: So it sounds like that’s a yes.TRUMP: No, no. When you say to a family that if you come we’re going to break you up, they don’t come. And we can’t afford to have anymore – look at New York City. Look what’s happening. They’re living in Central Park in New York City. The city is being swamped. Los Angeles is being swamped. Iowa is being swamped. Our whole country is being destroyed. Millions of people are coming into our country.And you know what the number is going to be, in my opinion, by the end of the year, not the 4 million that you hear and the 3 million. I think it’s going to be 15 million people. And in these people, they have no idea where they come from. They come from 129 different countries so far, 129, not just–COLLINS: But, Mr. President, just–TRUMP: – the four that we talk about.COLLINS: Just to put a button on that, it sounds like what you’re saying is that you’re not ruling out re-implementing that immigration policy. I want to get to another voter. Kaitlyn Boissoneau is a student here at St. Anselm College. She’s a Republican. This will be the first election that she has voted in.What’s your question for the president, Kaitlyn?KAITLYN BOISSONEAU, STUDENT, ST. ANSELM COLLEGE: Hello, President Trump.TRUMP: Hi.BOISSONEAU: Thank you so much for coming.TRUMP: Thank you.BOISSONEAU: The current administration has made it clear that we should continue to provide military equipment to Ukraine so that they can defend themselves. Do you support this decision? And how would you deal with the increasing threat posed by Vladimir Putin?TRUMP: First of all, thank you very much. That’s really nice. And it’s an important question. So important. Because we’re giving away so much equipment. We don’t want have ammunition for ourselves right now. We don’t have ammunition for ourselves. We’re giving away so much. But here’s the thing. Have to say it to start off. It no longer matters.If I were president, this would have never happened. And even the Democrats admit that. Putin knew it would have never happened and his pipeline would have never happened. A lot of things would have never happened. But this would never have happened.COLLINS: Which Democrats say that, Mr. President?TRUMP: And all those dead people, both Russian and Ukrainian, it wouldn’t – they wouldn’t be dead today. And all those cities that are blown up and disintegrated right to the ground, that wouldn’t have happened, OK?Now, here’s the problem. We’ve given so far $171 billion. They’ve given – they, meaning European Union, which is approximately the same size, altogether, as our economy, they’ve given about 20. So we’re at 170, let’s say, and they’re at 20. You don’t have to know too much about history to realize – or geography to realize that they’re a little bit more affected than we are, OK? So they’ve got to put up a lot more money because they’re taking advantage of us like every other country did.That’s why I ended NAFTA and replaced it with the USMCA, Mexico-Canada.COLLINS: But on this issue, Mr. President, I should know, I don’t know any Democrats who have said they don’t believe Putin would’ve invaded if you were president. But her question is, would you continue to give Ukraine money and weapons if you’re elected. What’s the answer?TRUMP: I have a very good relationship with President Zelenskyy because, as you know, he backed me up with the – with the phony impeachment – impeachment hoax, number one, when he said the president didn’t do anything wrong. So I happen to–COLLINS: That was when you asked–TRUMP: – like – so–COLLINS: – him for an investigation–TRUMP: – I happen to like – yes–COLLINS: – for weapons.TRUMP: – that’s right. And it was – I was totally exonerated, by the way. Just a waste of time and money.COLLINS: You were impeached over that.TRUMP: Yes, I was impeached.COLLINS: You were impeached over that. But let’s stay on topic here, Mr. President. Because the question is, would you give Ukraine weapons and funding?TRUMP: I was impeached by a crazy woman named Nancy Pelosi–COLLINS: But the question here is, would you give Ukraine weapons and funding if you are re-elected?TRUMP: I would sit down – let – let me just put it a nicer way. If I’m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.COLLINS: How would you settle that war in one day?TRUMP: First, I’ll meet with Putin, I’ll meet with Zelenskyy. They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths. And within 24 hours that war will be settled. It will be over. It will be absolutely over.COLLINS: Do you want Ukraine to win this war?TRUMP: I don’t think in terms of winning and losing. I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people and breaking down–COLLINS: What do you – can I just follow up on that? You said you don’t think in terms–TRUMP: But one of the things you have to do–COLLINS: – of winning and losing–TRUMP: – you have to get the – you have to get Europe–COLLINS: Mr. President, can I just follow up on that? Because that’s a really important statement that you just made there.TRUMP: Excuse me, let me just follow up.COLLINS: Can you say if you want Ukraine or Russia to win this war?TRUMP: I want everybody to stop dying. They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying.TRUMP: And I’ll have that done – I’ll have that done in 24 hours. I’ll have it done. You need the power of the presidency to do it.COLLINS: But you won’t say that you want Ukraine to win. You said when you were in–TRUMP: You know what I’ll say? I’ll say this.COLLINS: – in office–TRUMP: I want Europe to put up more money. Because they’re in for 20 billion, we’re in for 170. And they should be–COLLINS: But that’s not an answer about who should win the war.TRUMP: And they should equalize. They have plenty of money. They should equalize. I got with NATO–COLLINS: But I’m asking you about Ukraine right now, Mr. President.TRUMP: – to put up hundreds of billions of dollars that they weren’t paying under Obama and Bush and all of these other presidents. That’s why they’re – they’re able to help them fight the war because of the money I got. But I want Europe to–COLLINS: But let’s talk about what’s happening–TRUMP: Excuse me.COLLINS: – in Ukraine, Mr. President.TRUMP: I want Europe to put up more money. Because they’re laughing at us. They think we’re a bunch of jerks. We’re spending $170 billion for a faraway land and they’re right next door to that land, and they’re in for 20. I don’t think so.COLLINS: When it comes to what’s happening there, when you were in office, you said that you respected President Putin.TRUMP: Yes, I do.COLLINS: Do you still respect him today?TRUMP: He made a tremendous mistake. Made that – he made – he’s a smart guy, you know? I remember I said, he was smart, she was smart. They said, he–COLLINS: What was his mistake?TRUMP: – said President Xi of China, right, is smart. OK, 1.5 billion people, he’s the ruler of 1.5 billion people. I said, yes, he’s a smart guy. How dare he say he’s smart. Of course he’s smart. They want you to say he’s a stupid person. OK, he’s not a stupid person. He’s very smart. He’s very cunning. And Putin made a bad mistake, in my opinion.COLLINS: What was his mistake?TRUMP: It would have – his mistake was going in. He would have never gone in if I was president. We used to talk about it too.COLLINS: Do you believe he is a war criminal?TRUMP: What?COLLINS: Do you believe that Putin is a war criminal? He’s responsible for the deaths of thousands of Ukrainian–TRUMP: Well, I think this–COLLINS: – men and women and civilian –TRUMP: I think it’s something that should not be discussed now. It should be discussed later. Because right now we have to get a war – if you say he’s a war criminal, it’s going to be a lot tougher to make a deal to get this thing stopped, because if he’s going to be a war criminal, where people are going to go and grab him and execute him, he’s going to fight a lot harder than he’s fighting, you know, under the other circumstance.That’s something to be discussed at a later date.COLLINS: But isn’t it important to–TRUMP: Right now we want to get–COLLINS: – call it what it is?TRUMP: – that war settled. And I’m not talking about the money, either, I’m talking about all the lives that are being – the number of people being killed in that war is far greater than you’re hearing. When they blow up the city and those buildings come pouring down, and they say two people were injured, no, no, hundreds and thousands of people are being killed. And we have to get that war settled.COLLINS: We have more with former President Trump right after this. We’re going to take a quick break. And then we’ll be back to questions from voters right after that.COLLINS: Welcome back to CNN’s Republican Presidential Town Hall with former President Trump.President Trump, you – we had a lot more voters’ questions, I should note, in here in New Hampshire to get to. But I also want to talk about some of the other investigations that you’re facing. We’ve talked about others at the top. But one of those is the special counsel’s investigation into classified documents that–TRUMP: Sure.COLLINS: – were found at Mar-a-Lago. Why did you take those documents with you when you left the White House?TRUMP: I had every right to under the Presidential Records Act. You have the Presidential Records Act. I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified.Biden, on the other hand, he has 1,850 boxes. He had boxes sent to Chinatown, Chinatown, where they don’t speak even English in that Chinatown we’re talking about.COLLINS:  Well, can I – I got to stop you right there, because–TRUMP:  And nobody talks about him. They talk about us.Just so you understand, I had every right to do it. I didn’t make a secret of it. You know, the boxes were stationed outside of the White House. People were taking pictures of the GSA and the various people that were moving–COLLINS:  I got to stop you right there, though, because the Presidential Records Act, which is not well-known to a lot of people, I read it. It does not say that you can take documents with you.It says, actually, that they are the property of the federal government when you leave.TRUMP:  It says you – it says you talk, you negotiate, you make a deal.It’s not criminal, by the way, not – it’s –COLLINS:  It does – it does not say that you can negotiate.TRUMP:  The Presidential Records Act is not criminal. And just so you know–COLLINS:  It does not say you can negotiate to take the documents with you.TRUMP:  Just so you – can I tell you, just so you understand, the Presidential Records Act is not criminal.I took the documents. I’m allowed to. You know who else took them? Obama took them. Nixon took them. Reagan took them.COLLINS:  Obama did not take documents.TRUMP:  Oh, he didn’t? He didn’t?COLLINS:  The difference here that I would like to note –TRUMP:  Take a look.Reagan took them.COLLINS:  The National Archives says that President Obama did not documents.TRUMP:  Even Jimmy Carter. Even Mike Pence had some documents, and he’s a very honorable guy.COLLINS:  You referenced Pence. You referenced Biden.TRUMP:  But you know who took them more than anybody is Joe Biden. He has 1,800 boxes.COLLINS:  That’s not –COLLINS:  – Mr. President. And you know that.TRUMP:  And nobody even knows where they are, 1,800, and nobody talks about him.COLLINS:  Mr. President, that’s not accurate.TRUMP:  And they – and they put a rough guy on us. And they – in the meantime, they had nobody.COLLINS:  I think it’s important, Mr. President, to actually set the record straight here.They took documents, including President – Vice President Pence. When they realized they had documents, they turned them back over.The difference is that you waited to turn yours over, and it was a year-and-a-half effort–TRUMP:  Excuse me.COLLINS:  – that included a subpoena with those documents.One question about what happened when you had those documents.TRUMP:  It included a raid on my house. That what it included.COLLINS:  But you had gotten a – you had gotten a subpoena, and they had not been turned over yet.TRUMP:  They didn’t raid Biden’s house. They didn’t raid Biden’s house. You know what he – happened? They put him in the house. That’s the one with the Corvette where the documents were laying all over the floor. That was fine.TRUMP:  And you know who happens to be at Mar-a-Lago? Secret Service. And they’re phenomenal.I have Secret Service. He didn’t have Secret Service. The other thing, the vice president cannot declassify. He didn’t have the right to declassify. He has documents from when he was a senator, and even Democrat senators say, I can’t believe it.No, I went by the Presidential Records Act, and we were negotiating with NARA.COLLINS:  That’s not what the Presidential Records Act says. That’s not what it says, Mr. President.TRUMP:  And NARA has red-flagged a thing called the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights, because they consider them dangerous documents.COLLINS:  Mr. President, that’s not what it says. And I should note–TRUMP:  Those are the people we’re dealing with.COLLINS:  And I should note that there is a special counsel investigating your document situation, also President Biden’s document situation.When it comes to your documents, did you ever show those classified documents to anyone?TRUMP:  Not really. I would have the right to. By the way, they were declassified after–COLLINS:  What do you mean not really?TRUMP:  Not – not that I can think of.Let me just tell you, I have the absolute right to do whatever I want with them. I have the right. I was negotiating with NARA. Do you know what NARA is?COLLINS:  The National Archives.TRUMP:  Extremely – extremely left group of people.COLLINS:  But you don’t negotiate with them.TRUMP:  Extremely left. And I was negotiating with them.COLLINS:  They’re not left. They’re bipartisan.TRUMP:  All of a sudden, they raided my house.TRUMP:  They didn’t raid the house of Joe Biden. They didn’t raid Obama.COLLINS:  But Joe Biden didn’t ignore a subpoena to get those documents back, like you did. And so that’s the question.TRUMP:  Joe Biden took 1,850 boxes.COLLINS:  But that’s the question that investigators have, I think, is why you held onto those documents when you knew the federal government was seeking them and then had given you a subpoena to return them.TRUMP:  Are you ready? Are you ready? Can I talk?COLLINS:  Yes. What’s the answer?TRUMP:  Do you mind?TRUMP:  Can I – do you mind?COLLINS:  I would like for you to answer the question.TRUMP:  OK. It’s very simple to answer.COLLINS:  That’s why I asked it.TRUMP:  It’s very simple to – you’re a nasty person, I will tell you.COLLINS:  Can you answer why you – why you held onto the document?TRUMP:  Very simple.I was negotiating, and we were talking to NARA – that’s Washington – to bring whatever they want. They can have whatever they want.When we left Washington, we had the boxes lined up on the sidewalk outside for everybody. People are taking pictures of them. Everybody knew we were taking those boxes. And the GSA, the Government Service, the GSA was the one taking them. They brought them down to Mar-a-Lago.We were negotiating with NARA. All of a sudden, they raid our house. When Biden has his documents, he won’t give back the 1,850 boxes. And you’re going to find some real gems in there.COLLINS:  But it was Biden who alerted them that he had the documents.TRUMP:  So, you–TRUMP:  – have all these different sets of – all these different set of–COLLINS:  The National Archives reached out to you to get your documents back.Why did you not turn them over when you got a subpoena asking for you to turn them over?TRUMP:  Because we were negotiating with them. We were negotiating with them, as per, as per the Presidential Records Act. We were negotiating with NARA.COLLINS:  That’s not what the Presidential Records Act says. I have  seen it.TRUMP:  Very nice people, but they got to love our Constitution a little bit more, because – and they shouldn’t red-flag it, by the way.Very nice people. We were negotiating with NARA, and that’s what the Presidential Records Act says, because Richard Nixon, surprisingly, had problems. And he had a lot of problems dealing with NARA, and they ended up passing legislation–COLLINS:  Well, that’s why they created–TRUMP:  – called the Presidential Records Act just for this kind of a thing. We were dealing with them.COLLINS:  My last on this – on this subject, Mr. President–TRUMP:  We were talking to them. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Wait.We were talking to them. We would have done it. But, all of a sudden, they raided the house. Now, why haven’t – why hasn’t the FBI raided Biden?COLLINS:  But I just explained to you why.TRUMP:  Why? Eighteen hundred and 50 boxes.COLLINS:  It’s because he – they alerted the government that they had those documents and had them come and get the documents from his house.TRUMP:  OK. Why didn’t – no, he – they didn’t take them.COLLINS:  My question for you, though, when it comes to documents, do you still have any classified documents in your possession?TRUMP:  Are you ready?COLLINS:  Do you?TRUMP:  No. No, I don’t have anything. I have no classified documents. And, by the way, they become automatically declassified when I took them.COLLINS:  No, you had to declassify them.TRUMP:  But why – let me ask you a question. Why is it that Biden had nine boxes in Chinatown? And he gets a lot of money from China.TRUMP:  Why is that? And why–COLLINS:  There is no evidence of that, Mr. President. No, you cannot–COLLINS:  There is no evidence of that, Mr. PresidentTRUMP:  And why don’t they put this guy Jack Smith and his group of – and his group of thugs–COLLINS:  What you’re referring to is an office that he had.TRUMP:  Why don’t they put him in charge of that?COLLINS:  Mr. President, I need to stop you right there, because there’s no evidence of what you just said there.What you’re referring to there is an office that he had after leaving the vice presidency.TRUMP:  No, no. That’s at the University of Pennsylvania.COLLINS:  He had a temporary office.But I want to ask you about another investigation that you’re facing.TRUMP:  You’re so wrong. You don’t know the subject.COLLINS:  I do know the subject. And I do know the facts, Mr. President.TRUMP:  He had one at University of Pennsylvania, but he also had nine boxes in Chinatown.COLLINS:  I want to move on to another investigation that you’re facing, which is the one that’s happening in Georgia–TRUMP:  She doesn’t understand.COLLINS:  – where they are investigating there your efforts to overturn the election results in the state of Georgia.TRUMP:  I did nothing wrong. It was a perfect phone call.COLLINS:  At the center of that – let me finish my question.At the center of that is that call that you had with the secretary of state–TRUMP:  Perfect call.COLLINS:  – Brad Raffensperger.TRUMP:  Yes, sure.COLLINS:  Given the fact that there are indictments expected to come in that case this summer, is that a call you would make again today?TRUMP:  Yes, I called questioning the election. I thought it was a rigged election. I thought it had a lot of problems.I had every – I guess he’s secretary of state. I called – listen to this. There are like seven lawyers on the call, many of them from there. We’re having a call. We’re having a normal call. Nobody said, oh, gee, he shouldn’t have said that.Why – if this call was bad – I questioned the election.COLLINS:  You asked him to find you votes.TRUMP:  If this call was bad – I didn’t ask him to find anything.Let me just tell you–COLLINS:  We have heard the audiotape, Mr. President. There’s an audio of you asking him to find you 11,000-something votes.TRUMP:  – if this call was bad – I said, you owe me votes because the election was rigged. That election was rigged.And if this call was bad, why didn’t him and his lawyers hang up? How dare you say that?This was a perfect phone call.COLLINS:  Well, they were clearly concerned enough they recorded the call.And I should note that, of course–TRUMP:  This was a call that was made to question the results of election.And we have – and when we can’t make a call to question election results, then this country ought to just forget about it.COLLINS:  You weren’t just questioning the election results.TRUMP:  I was questioning the election.COLLINS:  You were asking him to find you votes.And I should note that there is no evidence of fraud. There is no rigged election in the state of Georgia.I want to get back to the audience, though, Mr. President, because those are false claims you’re making about what happened in Georgia.John – Jordan Sullenberger is here. He’s an undeclared voter from Hollis. He voted for you in 2020.Jordan, what is your question for President Trump tonight?JORDAN SULLENBERGER, MILITARY VETERAN:  Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP:  Thank you very much.SULLENBERGER:  I’m 26. I’m a veteran. I help manage a private aviation company.TRUMP:  You want a job?SULLENBERGER:  I’d love one, yes.TRUMP:  I’m looking – I’m looking for somebody very good.SULLENBERGER:  I – I’m not for mandates or government interference in private business.TRUMP:  Right.SULLENBERGER:  But I have seen Republicans going after us, like DeSantis, after Disney.TRUMP:  Right.SULLENBERGER:  What would you do as president to protect us from government interference?TRUMP:  Well, I’m the one that really wants to protect you.All of these fake investigations of me are about election interference. They think, because I’m leading Biden by 11 points, seven points, nine points, I’m leading DeSanctimonious by a lot–TRUMP:  – by 40 points or 45 points. I think he ought to just relax and take it easy and think about the future, because, right now, his future is not looking so good.I will tell you this. We are really putting it to Biden, but he’s putting it to himself, because the economy stinks, inflation is horrible, and the border is a disaster. And, by the way, the way he got out of Afghanistan was the single most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.COLLINS:  Mr. President, I have one more question for you here tonight.And I think, while we’re in front of the voters here in New Hampshire – in New Hampshire, this is a fundamental question for you.You are running in the 2024 race. If you are the Republican nominee and you are in that 2024 race, will you commit tonight to accepting the results of the 2024 election?TRUMP:  Yes, if I think it’s an honest election, absolutely, I would.COLLINS:  Will you commit to accepting the results of the election regardless of the outcome?TRUMP:  Do you want me to answer it again?If I think it’s an honest election, I would be honored to. And, right now, we are so far ahead of both Democrat and Republican. And you know what? If I don’t win, this country is going to be in big trouble. It’s so sad to see what’s happening.COLLINS:  But no commitment there on the – accepting the results regardless of the outcome?TRUMP:  It’s – if it’s an honest election, correct, I would.COLLINS:  OK, so not committing to accepting the 2020 election results or acknowledging what happened in 2020.TRUMP:  Go ahead.COLLINS:  President Trump, I want to thank you for coming here tonight.This is an important conversation with voters to hear and to have.Thank you to our audience and to our host, Saint Anselm College.COLLINS:  CNN’s coverage continues with Anderson Cooper and Jake Tapper.TRUMP:  Thank you.TRUMP:  Thank you very much.Thank you very much, Kaitlan.Good job.TRUMP:  Thank you.

A veto override would require a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress, which is not expected to happen. But passage in the Senate of the measures delivers a bipartisan rebuke to the president.The measures, under the Congressional Review Act, only needed a simple majority to pass in the SenateModerate Democrat Sen.

Dianne Feinstein, Senate Democrats approved several judicial nominees out of the Judiciary Committee on Thursday that had been stalled in her absence.Feinstein told reporters Thursday that she decided to return to work at this time because, “I felt better.”However, the committee did not vote on former New Hampshire Attorney General Michael Delaney, President Joe Biden’s embattled selection for the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals.The committee approved six Biden judicial nominees on Thursday, three of them moving forward on a party-line vote, meaning Feinstein’s attendance was necessary for them to advance. Those party-line nominees were Charnelle Bjelkengren, nominated for the US court in Eastern District of Washington;  S. Kato Crews, nominated for Colorado’s US district court; and Marian F.

427,451,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/supreme-court-pork-california-regulations/index.html,Supreme Court upholds California’s anti-animal cruelty law for pork,2023-05-11 13:25:00,"The Supreme Court upheld a California law that bars the sale of pork produced in other states unless the sow was housed in conditions that allowed her to move freely.The law was the brainchild of animal rights activists in the state, who worked for its passage saying it was necessary to reduce disease from crowded conditions. But the National Pork Producers Council brought a constitutional challenge to the law, arguing that it impermissibly regulates commerce between the states, because nearly all pork production occurs outside of California.The decision of the court was 5-4, though there was some disagreement among the justices in the majority on the reasons why the California law should be upheld.“While the Constitution addresses many weighty issues, the type of pork chops California merchants may sell is not on that list,” said Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority.Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the holding.At issue is Proposition 12 – a California law that bans the sale of pork meat, no matter where it is produced, in the state – unless the pig at issue was born to a sow that was housed with 24 square feet of space and in conditions that allowed her to move freely. Under the law, which has yet to take effect, every sale of covered pork in California that does not meet such standards is considered a crime punishable by a $1,000 fine or a 180-day prison sentence.The case raised questions regarding not only the issue of animal cruelty but whether one state could regulate another state’s production of pork and impose thousands of dollars of charges on pig farmers. While the state said the law was necessary so that Californians wouldn’t feel complicit in animal cruelty, pork producers said the law would burden interstate commerce in violation of the Constitution.“Although the specific issue in this case is very narrow, the implications are quite broad,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.“Today’s decision leaves a lot of room for states, by regulating what businesses can and must do within their borders, to impact how those businesses act in other states,” Vladeck said. “How far that goes remains to be seen in future cases, but it gives a lot of power, especially to larger states, to influence what happens elsewhere.”The producers told the justices that that the massive costs associated with the law fall almost exclusively on out of state farmers.  Across the country 65,000 farmers raise 125 million hogs per year. California accounts for 13% of the country’s pork consumption but raises few pigs.In Thursday’s ruling, however, a majority of the justices rejected the arguments that the producers put forward for why the law should be struck down. Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said that the producers were putting forward “aggressive” and “ambitious” interpretations of a legal doctrine known as the dormant Commerce Clause, which is said to forbid state laws that are intentionally discriminatory against interstate commerce.Gorsuch – in a part of his opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett – wrote that preventing “state officials from enforcing a democratically adopted state law in the name of the dormant Commerce Clause is a matter of ‘extreme delicacy,’ something courts should do only ‘where the infraction is clear.’”“Petitioners would have us cast aside caution for boldness,” Gorsuch wrote, “They have failed – repeatedly – to persuade Congress to use its express Commerce Clause authority to adopt a uniform rule for pork production.”The Humane Society of the United States, a champion of the California law, said Thursday that it was “delighted that the Supreme Court has upheld California Proposition 12 – the nation’s strongest farm animal welfare law – and made clear that preventing animal cruelty and protecting public health are core functions of our state governments.”In court, lawyers for the National Pork Producers – an organization that says it represents the interests of the $26 billion a year pork industry – argued that the costs of the law will raise prices across the country and that there is no scientific evidence that the law is necessary to improve sow welfare.They argued that hardly any commercially-bred sows in the United States are housed in such pens because they are almost universally kept in individual pens during the period between weaning and confirmation of pregnancy for “health and business” reasons. Because of the nature of the industry, a pig is processed into many cuts of meat and sold across the country which would mean that in practical terms, the law regulates the industry across the country, while California imports 99.8% of its pork.“When a state law is triggered only by in-state sales, a state may not project its legislation into other states” in this way, Timothy S. Bishop, a lawyer for the industry told the justices. “To do so infringes the territorial autonomy of sister states and it impedes our national common market.”The Biden administration sided with pork producers, arguing that the law places a substantial burden on interstate commerce without serving a legitimate local public interest. “It fails to respect the autonomy of California’s sister states,” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler told the justices. “It invites conflict and retaliation and threatens the balkinzation of the national economic union.”But the state argued that the proposition was passed so that the state’s citizens would not feel like morally complicit if the pork was produced in a way they regarded as inhumane.California Solicitor General Michael J. Mongan defended the law telling the court that Prop 12 bars the in-state sale of certain pork products.“California voters chose to pay higher prices to serve their local interest in refusing to provide a market to products they viewed as morally objectionable and potentially unsafe,” he said.The Supreme Court’s ruling Thursday showed that the justices were not on the same page about the scope of the Commerce Clause and when it can be used by courts to strike down state regulations because of the way the regulations affect the economic interests of other states.In a separate part of Gorsuch’s opinion, where he was joined only by Barrett and Thomas, he said that courts were not in a position to weigh the costs a state’s law may impose on interstate commerce against the benefits the law brings its residents.“In a functioning democracy, policy choices like these usually belong to the people and their elected representatives,” Gorsuch wrote. “They are entitled to weigh the relevant ‘political and economic’ costs and benefits for themselves … and ‘try novel social and economic experiments’ if they wish.”Sotomayor and Kagan, in a concurrence penned by Sotomayor, said they did not join that part of Gorsuch’s opinion because they believed courts are capable of weighing those interests. But in this case, they said, the pork producers failed the test. Barrett also wrote separately to say that, while she didn’t believe courts could balance those costs and benefits, if courts could, she’d let the lawsuit against the pork regulations go forward.Roberts – joined by Alito, Kavanaugh and Jackson – said he would have sent the case back to lower courts for further consideration on whether the burdens the regulations imposed on interstate commerce outweighed the benefits the pork law brings to California. Kavanaugh wrote an additional concurrence to raise questions he believes the law poses under other clauses of the Constitution.This story has been updated with additional details.",politics,0.0
428,452,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/joseph-percoco-supreme-court-corruption-case/index.html,Supreme Court sides with ex-Cuomo aide and Buffalo developer in disputes over corruption convictions,2023-05-11 12:43:00,"The Supreme Court on Thursday sided with a former aide of then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Joseph Percoco, who argued that a federal anti-bribery statute should not have been used to convict him.The court’s opinion continues a recent trend of narrowing the government’s ability to prosecute defendants under certain public corruption statutes. In a separate case Thursday, the court also ruled in favor of a prominent Buffalo developer who was awarded a $750 million project to improve the city as part of an initiative put forward by Cuomo.The man, Louis Ciminelli, was later convicted for taking part in rigging the bid process and property fraud. The justices reversed a lower court that had ruled against Ciminelli under a theory of law that the government later abandoned.Both decisions were unanimous.“They’re two additional data points of how hostile the current Court is to expansive interpretations of federal corruption and anti-bribery laws – and to aggressive white collar prosecutions by federal prosecutors,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.“The stakes of these cases aren’t likely to be high, but the stakes of this broader pattern could be enormous – especially so long as Congress, which could clarify the reach of all of these statutes, continues to sit on the sidelines,” Vladeck added.In recent years, the justices have narrowed the scope of the law in high-profile cases concerning Jeff Skilling, the former CEO of Enron, and former Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell.The Percoco case tested the scope of the “honest services” wire fraud statutes that make it a crime for public employees to defraud the government.Percoco served as a senior aide to Cuomo from 2011 to 2016 except for several months in 2014 when he managed the reelection campaign. During that time, he informed others he intended to eventually return to government.The government contended that even though he was working on the campaign, he still had access to his offices and continued to use them to conduct state business.While on the campaign, he received $35,000 from a real estate developer to pressure a state agency concerning issues related to labor law. He was charged with honest services fraud.But his lawyer contends that private citizens – who hold no elected office or government office – do not trigger the law because they do not owe any fiduciary duty to the public.“When a public official accepts money to convince the government to do something, we call him a crook,” Yaakov M. Roth, a lawyer for Percoco, argued in court papers. “But when a private citizen accepts money to convince the government to do something, we call him a lobbyist.”“Pressure counts only when one uses his official position for private gain,” he added.A lawyer for the government said that Percoco had continued to have key access to internal government meetings and could be prosecuted under fraud statutes because he accepted the bribes as a “former, future and functional public official.” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that he did not have to have “formal employment”.Justice Samuel Alito, in an opinion, said the instruction given to the jury that was meant to determine whether a private person may be convicted of honest services fraud was in error and “too vague.”The jury was told that Percoco could be found guilty if it found that he “dominated and controlled any government business” and if “people working in the government actually relied on him because of a special relationship he had with the government.”Alito added that the jury instructions needed more specificity. “Is it enough if an elected official almost always heeds the advice of a long-time political advisor?” he asked rhetorically. “Is it enough if an officeholder leans very heavily on recommendations provided by a highly respected predecessor, family member or old friend?”“We conclude that this is not the proper test for determining whether a private person may be convicted of honest-services fraud, and we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings,” Alito wrote.The court’s decision sends the case back to the lower court and could lead to the reversal of Percoco’s conviction.Percoco has other convictions against him, but the court was only considering one of those based on “honest services.”The second case the court decided Thursday dates back to 2012 when Cuomo, then a governor, announced an initiative to improve the city of Buffalo, New York.The state partnered with a nonprofit to request bids. It ultimately awarded the $750 million project to  LPCiminelli – a construction firm.It was later revealed, however, that a board member at the nonprofit drafted the bid proposal in a way that favored Louis Ciminelli’s company. Ciminelli was charged under a federal wire-fraud statute which criminalizes the use of interstate wires for any scheme for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses.The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction under a “right-to-control” theory that states property fraud occurs when a scheme deprives a victim of economic information necessary to make decisions.Cimenelli challenged his conviction.When the case arrived at the Supreme Court, the government effectively abandoned the “right-to-control” theory, and presented a new theory of “fraudulent inducement.”In court, Cimenelli’s lawyer, Michael R. Dreeben, urged the justices to reverse the 2nd Circuit and order his client’s acquittal based on the fact that the government was no longer supporting the theory that was the basis of his conviction.The Biden administration urged the justices not to reverse, but did distance itself from the 2nd Circuit opinion.In a brief unanimous opinion penned by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court said that the lower court’s theory in the case could not serve as the basis for conviction under federal fraud statutes because the wire fraud statute “reaches only traditional property interests” and not the “right to valuable economic information.”",politics,0.0

They’re dying. Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying,” Trump said at CNN’s town hall moderated by “CNN This Morning” anchor Kaitlan Collins. “And I’ll have that done in 24 hours.”Trump, who would not say whether he wants Ukraine to successfully deter Russia when pressed by Collins, told the audience gathered at Saint Anselm College that he doesn’t “think in terms of winning and losing.”“I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people,” he said.Trump – asked whether he supports providing US military aid to Ukraine by a Republican voter who will be casting a ballot for the first time in 2024 – would not commit to sending aid to the war-torn country, should he win the Republican presidential nomination and then the White House.“We’re giving away so much equipment, we don’t have ammunition for ourselves right now,” he said. “We don’t have ammunition for ourselves we’re giving away so much.”The White House last week estimated that the Russian military has suffered more than 100,000 casualties since December in its war with Ukraine. The US defines the term “casualty” as both wounded and killed.White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby declined at the time to provide information on Ukrainian casualties, noting that it is Ukraine’s decision to make its casualty figures public. “Ukrainians are the victims here, Russia is the aggressor … I don’t need to abide by that same sense of courtesy for the Russians,” he said.Pressed by Collins on the conflict, Trump replied, “I’ll say this: I want Europe to put up more money.”The US has provided Ukraine with $36.9 billion in military aid since the beginning of the war in February 2022.While Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin and solve the war in Ukraine “in one day, 24 hours,” he would not say whether he believed Putin was a war criminal but that it “should be discussed later.”The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN in March he believes Putin could stand trial for alleged crimes committed during Russia’s war.The ICC issued arrest warrants in March for Putin and Russian official Maria Lvova-Belova for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia – a practice the Russian government has defended as saving them while denying that the deportations are forced.Thousands of Ukrainian children have been subjected to forced deportations by Russia, according to Zelensky, who hailed the ICC’s decision at the time.“If you say he’s a war criminal, it’s going to be a lot tougher to make a deal to make this thing stopped,” Trump said. “If he’s going to be a war criminal, people are going to grab him and execute him, he’s going to fight a lot harder than he’s fighting under the other circumstance.”Trump called Putin “a smart guy,” but said the Russian leader “made a tremendous mistake.”“Of course he’s smart. They want you to say he’s a stupid person. He’s not a stupid person and he’s very cunning. Putin made a bad mistake in my opinion.”When asked to elaborate, Trump said, “His mistake was going in. He would have never gone in if I was president,” referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.In an interview with European public broadcasters that was published on Thursday, Zelensky expressed confidence that Ukraine will win the war by 2024, thus mitigating concerns over the outcome over the presidential election.“Who knows where we’ll be (when the election happens)?” Zelensky said, according to the BBC. “I believe we’ll win by then.”Other reaction across the Atlantic has so far been muted. European diplomats and officials expressed concern at Trump’s comments but also noted that he has a history of making outlandish and contradictory statements on foreign affairs, according to conversations with four diplomats from four different European nations.The sources – none of whom wished to be quoted – told CNN they took Trump’s comments seriously but noted that his views did not have any practical effect for now, since he is not currently the Republican nominee. Even if Trump did end up back in the White House in January 2025, Europeans hope the Ukraine war will be over by then.But Trump’s former defense secretary, Mark Esper, said the comments from the Republican front-runner are likely to rattle allies and is “the wrong message to send.”“I fully expect that this is the chatter throughout the European capitals and other capitals around the world, quite frankly, because it’s not just about Russia invading Ukraine,” Esper said Thursday on “CNN This Morning.” “It’s about the possibility that China could invade Taiwan at some point in the future as well, and the question is, will America stand up? Will America support democracies, like Ukraine and Taiwan, and defend them like we’ve done in the past for decades?”",politics,0.0

And flare ups at the border will come almost a month after Biden and Harris launched their 2024 reelection bid, testing voters opinions on this emotionally charged issue.“Perception is a big part of politics,” said Andrew Selee, president of the non-partisan think tank Migration Policy Institute, who met with the vice president in 2021. “It matters for the vice president what happens over the next few weeks and the next few months.”Migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to the US has reached notable lows since its height in 2021, while migrants from other countries like Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua have increased dramatically.Border arrests are often cited in assessing an administration’s handling of the US-Mexico border, even if they are not the most apt metric, experts say. White House officials are keenly aware of that and watching closely to see if the number of migrants from Central America tick back up in the coming days and weeks, the administration official said.Publicly, the vice president’s office has called the current downward trend “encouraging,” and privately, aides cite investments in the region under Harris’ guidance as one of many factors for the drop.So far, the vice president has secured more than $4.2 billion in private sector commitments from companies as a fundamental part of her plan to incentivize would-be migrants to stay home. Around 47 entities are collaborating across financial services, textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications, and nonprofit sectors to bolster the region’s economy, according to a White House fact sheet from February, the last major public update.Diplomatically, Harris has visited Guatemala and Honduras. She’s held in-person and on the phone conversations with those counterparts but affronts to democracy and corruption concerns have limited Harris’ ability to fully engage, officials say.Harris’ public events to tout the progress made in the region have waned in the last year with her attention turned to other domestic crises like reproductive rights, voting rights and shoring up democracy. Still, those close to the Harris say she is routinely involved.“She’s engaged. She knows the content. She’s driving the team forward as an executive should. She gives us direction in a clear manner,” Jonathan Fantini-Porter, executive director and CEO of Partnership for Central America, which acts as a liaison between companies and the US government and regularly engages with the vice president’s office. “You can have a very in-depth conversation with her. She’s able to talk about metrics, direction of where things are.”The vice president receives monthly updates, a source familiar with Harris’ schedule said. Many times, the meetings consist of a progress review and strategic vision. But the next 48-hours and likely weeks ahead once Title 42 is lifted will test the credibility and efficacy of the vice president’s mission.“The people who will be loudest, they’re playing politics,” said Dan Restrepo, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and former senior Obama adviser who met with the vice president’s office on this issue.Restrepo added, “They aren’t particularly interested in working the issue, they’re interested in the political benefits.”The vice president’s task, the first major issue assigned to her in March 2021, was billed as a longterm effort to develop a larger strategic partnership with Central American countries and stem the flow of migrants. At the time, an influx of unaccompanied minors apprehended on the US southern border were from Central America – a region where major hurricanes and the coronavirus pandemic took a devastating toll.Since then, the number of border encounters from there have receded. In March 2021, border authorities encountered more than 85,000 migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. During the same time period this year, the number dropped to around 34,000, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.In the last two years, the vice president has launched two pillars of her long-term plan: a “Call to Action” to court businesses to invest in the region and an initiative dubbed “Central America Forward,” that focuses on good governance and labor rights.Ensuring good governance has been the hardest part of Harris’ task due to the unfavorable conditions to foster democracy. In El Salvador, there’s been concern about limiting checks and balances in government, while in Guatemala, there have been concerns about government corruption. And in Honduras, the election of President Xiomara Castro has not brought radical change to corruption or organized crime once believed.“Combatting corruption is a central pillar of our effort to address root causes of migration, and we will not waver in this,” a White House official told CNN. “But the existence of corruption has not prevented us from successfully tackling additional root causes of migration.”In the absence of the environment to deepen diplomatic relationships, Harris has leaned hard into private sector investments. She’s courted millions from companies like Microsoft, Mastercard, Chobani, Duolingo, Nespresso, Bancolombia and Davivienda. Microsoft pledged to expand internet access to as many as 3 million people in the region by July 2022 and Chegg, an online-learning platform, has committed to certifying 100,000 young adult students in Honduras by 2030.Experts credit Harris’ ability to secure private sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date. Still, those who have stake in the region question the durability of those investments over the long term without more diplomatic success in the region.“If you’re trying to build these relationships with these corrupt actors and you’re just so focused on investment, investment, investment without requiring conditions to those countries, I think that’s problematic,” Ana María Méndez-Dardón, director for Central America at Washington Office on Latin America, told CNN.Harris’ efforts alongside the Partnership for Central America are meant to lay down the economic groundwork now to reap major benefits for the people of Central America in the future. And the US government, they say, has stepped up their own abilities to match private investments. A White House official says the administration is on track to meet its commitment under the Root Causes Strategy to increase US foreign assistance to the region by providing $4 billion over four years.But most, who support the vice president’s efforts, have cautioned that it’s likely too soon to see the real impact of those contributions in the region.“I think we will only actually know if a strategy is working a few years down the road, because, again, this is a strategy that’s tackling long-term systemic issues,” Jason Marczak, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, told CNN.So, the vice president will have twin challenges, experts and allies maintain. First is to progress in her Northern Triangle task and second, is to battle the perception that she is responsible for the border too, no matter how chaotic the situation becomes.“The vice president’s big problem on this issue is that she’s wanted to own the investment side, but not the border strategy,” a source familiar with the vice president’s strategy told CNN. That makes her vulnerable, the source said, because, “she’s politically responsible for whatever happens.”",politics,0.0
432,456,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/takeaways-trump-town-hall-cnn/index.html,8 takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall in New Hampshire,2023-05-11 07:25:00,"The 2024 presidential campaign is only beginning, but former President Donald Trump made clear that his third bid for the White House will feel very much like the first two.Could he stop lying about the 2020 election?Did he regret his role in the US Capitol riot on January 6, 2021?Would he attempt to walk the line in a bid to win over moderate voters?No and no. Emphatically no.Trump might be trying a new tack in this campaign, running what is, to date, a more conventional race with less internal drama. But when pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, the 76-year-old showed on Wednesday night that he is very much the same person Americans came to know in 2016, throughout his four years in office, and in the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat.During the town hall, the former president talked up a potential debt default as a minor inconvenience, wouldn’t say if he’d back Ukraine over Russia in the war and spoke glowingly of his family separation policy at the US border.Notably, Trump refused to plant a flag in the sand on a potential federal abortion ban. He did, however, make a number of false claims about abortion being conducted at “nine months.”He repeated much of what he’s said previously. Trump blamed others for the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. He lied about the timeline of that day, suggesting he had called for his supporters to stand down earlier than he actually did. And he again criticized former Vice President Mike Pence for not trying to overturn the election results.He smeared former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, the day after a Manhattan federal jury found that Trump sexually abused her in 1996, and Trump repeated his infamous comments from the “Access Hollywood” tape that emerged in 2016.When he wasn’t calling women names, airing old grievances or attempting to rewrite history, the former president largely dodged questions and follow-up inquiries from Collins, saying he was “looking at” his options, without committing to anything in particular.Unsurprisingly, the mostly Trump-loyal audience lapped it up. Trump’s place in the GOP primary polls, as he often mentioned, is strong. In New Hampshire on Wednesday night, he showed why.Here are 8 takeaways from Trump’s CNN town hall:A little more than 24 hours after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, and awarded her $5 million, the former president denied the accusations and again said he had never met Carroll.“This woman, I don’t know her. I never met her. I have no idea who she is,” Trump said, before going off on an odd tangent about her former husband and a pet.Trump also brushed off a question over whether the verdict would hurt his standing with female voters, saying he doubted it. The reaction from the Trump-friendly audience appeared to support his opinion – they laughed at his jokes and other dismissive comments about Carroll.While the jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, they did not find that Carroll proved he raped her – a distinction Trump was quick to point out.Carroll filed the lawsuit last November under the New York State Adult Survivors Act, a state bill that allowed renewed consideration of sexual assault allegations that would previously have been mooted by the statute of limitations.The US is on the brink of a catastrophic default on its sovereign debt. Asked what his advice is to Republicans in Washington, Trump was clear.“If they don’t give you massive cuts,” he said, “you’re going to have to do a default.”Trump predicted that Democrats would “cave” in the current negotiations, but insisted that default would be preferable to a result that doesn’t stop the government “spending money like drunken sailors.”The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress in January. That forced the Treasury Department to begin taking so-called extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the debt limit.A default would eliminate millions of jobs, with generational wealth wiped out, Moody’s Analytics has warned. The impact could include a delay in Social Security payments, late paychecks for federal employees and veterans.Trump repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would sign into law a federal abortion ban, as well as after how many weeks into a pregnancy abortion should be made illegal.He touted the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion rights as “such a great victory” – and one made possible by his appointment of three conservative justices.But Trump also recognized splits within the GOP over whether to impose a federal abortion ban, and what the conditions of such a ban should be. Democrats have won statewide referendums, judicial races and more while emphasizing their support for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision.Trump said he supports exemptions to abortion bans for cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened.“We now have a great negotiating ability, and I think we’re going to be able to get something done,” Trump said.Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to prevail in its war with invading Russia.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing,” he said, “I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people.”Asked to choose a side he would prefer to win, Trump again demurred. “I want everyone to stop dying,” he said before promising to end the war in “24 hours.”Ultimately, Trump fell back on two familiar topics: demanding Europe “put up more money” in support of Western goals and speaking meekly about Russian President Vladimir Putin.“He made a tremendous mistake” Trump said of Putin, before adding, “He is a smart guy.”The mistake, Trump said, “was going in” to Ukraine – something, the former president added, that would not have happened if he were still in the White House.Trump demonstrated no remorse for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.Asked about former Vice President Mike Pence’s claims that Trump’s actions put his family’s lives in danger, Trump said he does not owe Pence an apology – and blamed his former vice president for his ceremonial role in counting Electoral College votes.“No, because he did something wrong. He should have put the votes back to the state legislature,” Trump said, wrongly insisting that Pence had the legal authority to reject some states’ electoral votes.Trump also said he was “inclined to pardon” many of the pro-Trump rioters who were convicted for their roles in the attack on the Capitol.He said he won’t be able to pardon “every single one” but said “it will be a large portion of them.”And he criticized the US Capitol Police officer who shot and killed rioter Ashli Babbitt, who was attempting to crawl through a broken window leading to the House Speaker’s Lobby.Trump said he would return to one of the harshest immigration enforcement policies imposed by his administration: separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border.The “zero tolerance” policy encapsulated the lengths Trump’s administration was willing to go to deter migrants from coming to the United States, and Trump said it remained a strong deterrent.“When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come,” Trump said.His comments come with Title 42, the Trump-era pandemic public health restriction that became a key tool officials used to expel migrants at the US-Mexico border, set to expire Thursday.As he has at virtually every stop since leaving office, Trump repeated his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.He also would not commit to accepting the results of the 2024 presidential election, saying he would only do so “if I think it’s an honest election.”Collins pointed out that Republican state elections officials in Georgia and elsewhere had refuted Trump’s falsehoods, and that Trump and his supporters lost dozens of lawsuits over the 2020 race. But Trump deflected, repeating debunked claims about fraudulent votes.“I think it’s a shame what happened. I think it’s a very sad thing for our country,” Trump said.Trump kept up his long habit of name-calling Wednesday night.Democratic former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is “a crazy woman.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 GOP presidential primary rival, is “DeSantimonious.” Pence, who rejected Trump’s urging to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election, is “the human conveyor belt.” The US Capitol Police officer who shot and killed Babbitt is a “thug.” (The rioters, meanwhile, were “great people.”) Carroll, in Trump’s telling, is a “whack job.” And when Collins pressed Trump about documents he took from the White House, he said: “You’re a nasty person.”The jabs are standard fare for Trump, who en route to the GOP nomination in 2016 branded rivals with nicknames. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was “low energy.” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was “Lyin’ Ted.” And when then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly pressed Trump on his history of insulting women in a 2015 debate, Trump falsely said of Kelly: “There was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”",politics,0.0

They could have to start paying for testing and treatment that they’ve grown used to being free during the pandemic. A lot depends on what type of health coverage folks have.Get ready to pay for Covid-19 tests. Though health insurers will continue to cover tests ordered by a medical provider, many policyholders will now face deductibles and copays as part of that coverage.The median price of a Covid-19 test in an outpatient setting was $45 in 2021, though prices varied widely, according to a new report by KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation. Hospital-based tests typically cost $51 for an antigen test and $91 for a PCR test.The recent average price for an at-home rapid Covid-19 test was $11, KFF found.Many Americans will have to start paying for pharmaceutical treatments for Covid-19, including remdesivir, an antiviral drug that is generally delivered intravenously.However, treatment doses purchased by the federal government, such as Paxlovid, are available to everyone at no charge as long as supplies last.Not much changes immediately when it comes to Covid-19 vaccines because the federal government has purchased all of the current supply and is providing it at no charge to all Americans.Once that supply runs out, vaccines will continue to be free for most people thanks to the Affordable Care Act and other laws enacted by Congress.The public health emergency also allowed people to receive prescriptions for controlled substances via telehealth.The Food and Drug Administration this week announced it is extending those flexibilities for six months.",health,0.0

With his sights set on the 2024 GOP presidential primary, here are key moments from the event:When asked if he feels he owes Mike Pence an apology for his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, Trump said his former vice president “did something wrong.”During a taped deposition that was part of the E.

New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation GOP primary, is also home to many swing voters and is a state he lost in both 2016 and 2020 after winning the primaries.The audience of Republicans and undeclared voters who plan to vote in the GOP primary cheered Trump throughout the evening, including when he attacked Tuesday’s jury verdict that found he sexually abused former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll. Trump mocked Carroll on Wednesday while downplaying the significance of the $5 million the jury awarded her for battery and defamation.The former president said he would pardon “a large portion” of the rioters at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and even pulled out a printout of his own tweets from that day in an attempt to deflect blame as Collins pressed him on why he waited three hours before telling the rioters to leave the Capitol.“I am inclined to pardon many of them,” Trump said Wednesday night.When Collins pressed Trump on the Manhattan federal jury finding Trump sexually abused Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in 1996, Trump suggested it was helping his poll numbers.When asked if the jury’s decision would deter women from voting for him, the former president said, “No, I don’t think so.”Trump insulted Carroll, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and even Collins when she pressed him on a question about why he hadn’t returned classified documents he kept at Mar-a-Lago.“It’s very simple – you’re a nasty person, I’ll tell you,” Trump said on stage.Trump also took questions from New Hampshire voters on the economy and policy issues, such as abortion. The former president, who solidified the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that struck down Roe v. Wade, repeatedly declined to say whether he would sign a federal abortion ban if he won a second term.Trump suggested Republicans should refuse to raise the debt limit if the White House does not agree to spending cuts.“I say to the Republicans out there – congressmen, senators – if they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default, and I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave, will absolutely cave because you don’t want to have that happen, but it’s better than what we’re doing right now because we’re spending money like drunken sailors,” Trump said.When Collins asked him to clarify whether the US should default if the White House doesn’t agree to cuts, Trump said, “We might as well do it now than do it later.”Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump also faces potential legal peril in both Washington, DC – where a special counsel is leading a pair of investigations – and in Georgia, where the Fulton County district attorney plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State.Still, the twice-impeached former president has repeatedly said that any charges will not stop him from running for president, dismissing all of the investigations as politically motivated witch hunts. That’s a view many GOP voters share, according to recent surveys. Nearly 70% of Republican primary voters in a recent NBC News poll said investigations into the former president “are politically motivated” and that “no other candidate is like him, we must support him.”Trump was pressed on the investigation into his handling of classified documents and why he didn’t return all of the documents in his possession after receiving a subpoena. He responded by pointing out the classified documents found at the homes of others – including President Joe Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence. But they both returned the documents once they discovered they had them in their possession.The FBI obtained a search warrant and retrieved more than 100 classified documents from Trump’s Florida resort in August 2022, which came after he had received a subpoena to return documents in June 2022 and after his attorney had asserted that all classified material in his possession had been returned.Asked during the town hall whether he showed the classified documents to anyone at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said, “Not really.”The former president would not say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to win the war during Wednesday’s town hall, instead saying that he wants the war to end.“I don’t think in terms of winning and losing. I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people,” he said.When asked again whether or not the former president wants Ukraine to win, Trump did not answer directly, but instead claimed that he would be able to end the war in 24 hours.“Russians and Ukrainians, I want them to stop dying,” Trump said. “And I’ll have that done in 24 hours.”Trump said he thinks that “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin made a mistake” by invading Ukraine, but he stopped short of saying that Putin is a war criminal.That’s something that “should be discussed later,” Trump said.“If you say he’s a war criminal, it’s going to be a lot tougher to make a deal to make this thing stopped,” he said.While a handful of rivals have entered the Republican presidential primary – and Trump’s biggest potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has not yet officially launched a bid – Trump has maintained a healthy lead in early GOP primary polling. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday, 43% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents named Trump unprompted when asked who they would like to see the party nominate in 2024, compared with 20% naming DeSantis, and 2% or less naming any other candidate.Trump’s participation in the town hall was indicative of a broader campaign strategy to try to expand his appeal beyond conservative media viewers, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported earlier Wednesday. He’s surrounded himself with a more organized team and has been making smaller retail politics stops while scaling back larger rallies – signs of a more traditional campaign than his 2016 and 2020 operations. He lost that 2020 race by about 7 million votes, although he continues to falsely claim it was stolen from him – claims he stuck to on Wednesday night.There have been warning signs for the GOP that the obsession with the 2020 election isn’t palatable beyond the base. Many of Trump’s handpicked candidates who embraced his election lies in swing states lost in last year’s midterm elections.

Rashida Tlaib meant to commemorate al-Nakba, or “the catastrophe,” as many Arabs refer to the period surrounding the birth of Israel, saying it’s “wrong for members of Congress to traffic in antisemitic tropes about Israel.”As Israel was created in 1948, a war broke out between the Israelis and Arabs, and some 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were expelled from their homes in what became the State of Israel. Many Arabs, especially Palestinians, commemorate the displacement every year as Nakba Day.McCarthy intervened late Tuesday to reserve the Capitol Visitor Center space where Tlaib – the first Palestinian-American US congresswoman – was going to host a Wednesday event, according to a spokesperson for McCarthy.Tlaib responded in a statement, saying, “Speaker McCarthy wants to rewrite history and erase the existence and truth of the Palestinian people, but he has failed to do so. This event is planned to bring awareness about the Nakba and create space for Palestinian Americans who experienced the Nakba firsthand to tell their stories of trauma and survival.”“We fully plan on moving forward with this event and we will continue to ensure that Palestinian voices are heard. We will not be silenced,” Tlaib said in the statement.The event was ultimately held at the Dirksen Senate building, just not on the House side as originally planned, and due to the last-minute location change, staff said they couldn’t secure permits to allow filming.Dozens of people attended with several standing around the edges of the room and spilling outside the door.Speakers included Dr. Abed Musa in conversation with his daughter, Jumana Musa.“It’s ironic we’ve been displaced at our Nakba event,” Jumana Musa said. “They thought they could bury us, but they didn’t know we were seeds.” One woman was seen wiping tears from her eyes, as Abed Musa spoke.Tlaib’s event was called “Nakba 75 & the Palestinian People, an educational community event featuring special guest, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.”According to the invitation, “May 15th marks 75 years since the beginning of the Nakba, which means ‘catastrophe.’ Seventy-five years ago, Zionist militias and the new Israeli military violently expelled approximately three-quarters of all Palestinians from their homes and homeland in what became the state of Israel.”“To uplift the experiences of Palestinians who underwent the Nakba, and educate Members of Congress and their staff about this history and the ongoing Nakba to which Israel continues to subject Palestinians, we’ve partnered together to host this congressional and community educational event, to be followed immediately afterward by dinner,” the invite says.McCarthy would instead lead a bipartisan briefing celebrating the 75th anniversary of the US-Israel relationship instead, his office said.“It’s wrong for members of Congress to traffic in antisemitic tropes about Israel,” McCarthy said in a statement to CNN from his office. “As long as I’m speaker, we are going to support Israel’s right to self-determination and self-defense, unequivocally and in a bipartisan fashion.”The event was organized by a number of groups, including Institute for Middle East Understanding, Americans for Justice in Palestine Action, Project48, Democracy for the Arab World Now, US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, American Friends Service Committee, Virginia Coalition for Human Rights, Emgage Action and Jewish Voice for Peace Action.Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, praised McCarthy’s decision to cancel the event, saying it was “inappropriate.”“I think Congresswoman Tlaib has freedom of speech, First Amendment, but the speech is very anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian, and I think very inappropriate on the 75th anniversary of the State of Israel being formed,” he said outside a Republican conference meeting.This story has been updated with additional developments.",world,0.0

They now head to the desk of Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who has expressed support for the legislation and is expected to sign them.One of the bills passed, SB49, would limit minors’ access to gender-affirming care, which spans a range of evidence-based treatments and approaches that benefit transgender and nonbinary people. The types of care vary by the age and goals of the recipient, and are considered the standard of care by many mainstream medical associations.If enacted, the bill would bar health care providers from performing gender transition surgeries, although such surgeries are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors.Puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors would also be banned until August 2027, but the legislation makes an exemption for those who begin receiving treatment before its effective date on August 28, 2023.This bill follows an emergency rule issued by the state’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey last month that put limits on gender-affirming care for minors and adults. The rule has been paused through at least July 20 as a lawsuit plays out.Republicans, including the governor, have argued that the bill is about protecting minors from permanent health treatments.“All children, regardless of their gender or orientation, are invaluable and should not be subjected to potentially irreversible surgeries and treatments prior to adulthood,” Parson tweeted Wednesday.However, opponents slammed the lawmakers who voted in favor of the bill, saying that “erasing trans youth is just the start of the despot tactics” that lawmakers are willing to utilize to target “vulnerable Missourians.”“Gender-affirming care saves lives,” said the American Civil Liberties Union chapter of Missouri in a statement. “The Jefferson City politicians’ intentional choice to abuse transgender Missourians will devastate trans people and their families.” The ACLU was one of several advocacy groups that filed a lawsuit against the attorney general’s rule last month.Lawmakers on Wednesday also passed SB39, which prohibits public and private schools, including colleges, from allowing students to participate in gendered athletic competitions that do not match their biological sex as listed on a birth certificate or government record, or from competing against a team without such a policy.“The presence of biological males in women’s sports limits fair competition for hard-working female athletes,” Parson said in a tweet. “Women & girls fought hard for the equal rights they enjoy today, and they should not be deprived of athletic opportunity due to biological advantages of the opposite sex.”However,  a 2017 report  in the journal Sports Medicine that reviewed several related studies found “no direct or consistent research” on trans people having an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, and critics say this legislation adds to the discrimination that trans people face.So far this year, 13 states have placed restrictions on transgender youths’ access to gender-affirming care, including Oklahoma’s care ban earlier this month. According to the ACLU, more than 470 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced nationwide this legislative session.",politics,0.0

Families not found to have credible fear are subject to removal under the fast-track deportation process, known as “expedited removal,” which would bar them from the US for five years.The program is one of many initiatives being rolled out by the Biden administration to try to manage the flow of migrants at the US-Mexico border – in this case, families – following the expiration of a Covid-era border restriction, known as Title 42.“[Enforcement and Removal Operations] is committed to imposing immigration consequences in a safe and humane manner to those who unlawfully enter the United States,” said ICE ERO Executive Associate Director Corey Price in a statement.“Families should not listen to the lies of smugglers. Like single adults, noncitizens travelling with their children who do not have a lawful basis to remain in the United States will be quickly removed and barred from reentry for at least five years,” the statement continued.Last year, ICE piloted a similar program with migrants who resided in Baltimore and Houston and set a curfew from dusk until dawn.Administration officials have been racing to deal with a significant increase in the number of migrants trying to cross into the US as Title 42 – a pandemic-era rule that has allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants encountered at the border – is set to expire.The Biden administration came under fierce criticism earlier this year amid reports that officials were considering restarting family detention, a practice that had been ended by President Joe Biden. Officials have since maintained that there are no plans to return the practice.But the high number of border arrests in recent days has put the challenge facing the administration into sharp focus.US border authorities encountered more than 10,000 migrants along the US southern border on Tuesday, according to a Homeland Security official, already surpassing government estimates for the Title 42 aftermath.Among the new policy measures the administration is putting into place is a new asylum rule that will largely bar migrants who passed through another country from seeking asylum in the US. The rule, proposed earlier this year, will presume migrants are ineligible for asylum in the US if they didn’t first seek refuge in a country they transited through, like Mexico, on the way to the border. Migrants who secure an appointment through the CBP One app will be exempt, according to officials.This story has been updated with additional details.CORRECTION: The headline and story have been updated to reflect The Los Angeles Times was the first to report on the program’s roll out.",politics,0.0

You express concern that the FBI has inappropriately ‘failed to disclose’ such a report ‘to the American people,’” Christopher Dunham, acting assistant director for the FBI’s office of congressional affairs, said in the letter to Comer, a copy of which was obtained by CNN.“It is critical to the integrity of the entire criminal justice process and to the fulfillment of our law enforcement duties that FBI avoid revealing information — including unverified or incomplete information — that could harm investigations, prejudice prosecutions or judicial proceedings, unfairly violate privacy or reputational interests, or create misimpressions in the public,” he continued in the letter.FBI Director Christopher Wray declined during his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday to confirm whether the document exists.“I will tell you that we understand completely the importance of congressional oversight, that’s important to me,” Wray said. “I also understand very much, as I think you do, the importance of us protecting sources and methods and ongoing investigations.”The White House has previously slammed the unverified claim against Biden, calling it another one of Republicans’ “unfounded politically-motivated attacks.”In a six-page response to Comer, Dunham said that FD-1023 form is “used by FBI agents to record unverified reporting from a confidential human source,” and noted that there are strict Justice Department guidelines about when that information can be provided outside of the FBI.Dunham also outlined the shortcomings of relying solely on this law enforcement document – which includes unverified allegations – to draw conclusions.“An FD-1023 form documents information as told to a line FBI agent. Recording the information does not validate the information, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI,” Dunham wrote. “The mere existence of such a document would establish little beyond the fact that a confidential human source provided information and the FBI recorded it. Indeed, the FBI regularly receives information from sources with significant potential biases, motivations, and knowledge, including drug traffickers, members of organized crime, or even terrorists.”Dunham added that such documents include “leads and suspicions” and “later and more complete reports might exonerate individuals cast in a negative light by reports from earlier in an investigation.”Comer and Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, claimed they had spoken to an unnamed whistleblower who claimed the FBI document included evidence that Biden, while vice president, was allegedly involved in an illegal payment that also involved a foreign national. Comer subpoenaed the document, setting a Wednesday deadline for the FBI to provide it. Pressed in media interviews for more details about the whistleblower’s claims, Grassley has admitted he does not know whether they are true or false.“It’s clear from the FBI’s response that the unclassified record the Oversight Committee subpoenaed exists, but they are refusing to provide it to the Committee,” Comer said in a statement Wednesday. “We’ve asked the FBI to not only provide this record, but to also inform us what it did to investigate these allegations. The FBI has failed to do both. The FBI’s position is ‘trust, but you aren’t allowed to verify.’ That is unacceptable. We plan to follow up with the FBI and expect compliance with the subpoena.”Grassley added in a statement that “today’s letter from the FBI raises additional questions, including whether the FBI has an open investigation based on these allegations.”Dunham said in his letter to the committee that the FBI was willing to coordinate with committee staff to “to discuss whether and how we can accommodate your request without violating our law enforcement and national security obligations.”",politics,0.0
440,464,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/george-santos-indicted-arrested/index.html,"George Santos pleads not guilty to 13 federal charges, including fraud and money laundering",2023-05-10 18:39:00,"Rep. George Santos has pleaded not guilty to 13 federal charges, including allegations of fraud related to Covid-19 unemployment benefits, misusing campaign funds and lying about his personal finances on House disclosure reports.Santos was released on a $500,000 bond, according to the US Attorney’s Office in New York. He was ordered to surrender his passport and will need permission to travel outside of Washington, DC, New York City and Long Island.The New York Republican appeared in a federal court on Long Island on Wednesday. He has been charged on seven counts of wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, one count of theft of public funds and two counts of making materially false statements to the House of Representatives.In a combative, impromptu press conference after his arraignment, Santos said that he has been “compliant throughout this entire process” but blasted the indictment as a “witch hunt” and said he will “fight my battle.”The charges inject fresh uncertainty into the political future of Santos, a freshman congressman whose astonishing pattern of lies and fabrications stunned even hardened politicos and led top Democrats and some New York Republicans to call for his resignation earlier this year.The congressman said on Wednesday that he will not resign from his seat and that he still plans to seek reelection next year.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said Wednesday he would wait before calling on Santos to resign.“It always concerns me,” McCarthy told CNN after being informed of the money laundering and wire fraud charges.“He will go through his time in trial and let’s find out how the outcome is,” McCarthy added.Later, the speaker said he will not support Santos’ reelection, telling CNN that “Santos has a lot going on. I think he has other things to focus on in his life other than running for reelection.”McCarthy confirmed that if the Ethics Committee determines Santos broke the law, he would call for him to resign.Prosecutors allege Santos, 34, solicited campaign funds under false pretense and used them for personal expenses like designer clothing.The indictment accuses Santos of undertaking a “fraudulent political contribution solicitation scheme,” alleging that he set up a company and got supporters to contribute funds to it under the false pretense that the money would benefit his political campaign.“Taken together, the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself,” said US Attorney Breon Peace in a statement. “He used political contributions to line his pockets, unlawfully applied for unemployment benefits that should have gone to New Yorkers who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and lied to the House of Representatives.”Santos, who was elected last year to represent a district that includes parts of Long Island and Queens, has been under investigation in multiple jurisdictions and by the House Ethics Committee. The congressman has admitted to making some misleading claims about his education and financial status but continues to deny the more serious allegations. He has not admitted any crimes.He was taken into custody in Melville, a law enforcement source told CNN. From there, he was taken to the courthouse in Central Islip.Santos is accused of fraudulently applying for unemployment benefits, with the indictment alleging he falsely claimed to be unemployed in an application for a pandemic-related unemployment insurance program.Though he claimed in the application he had been unemployed since March 2020, according to prosecutors, he was employed at an investment firm and, as part of a $120,000 annual salary, he was allegedly receiving regular deposits – with the exception of one period in July and August 2020.He was employed at the firm between February 2020 and mid-April 2021, the indictment alleges. But, because of the repeated false assertions he is alleged to have made to the unemployment program, Santos also received $24,744 in benefits, according to prosecutors.Santos made false statements on multiple financial disclosure reports to the House of Representatives during his two congressional races, according to the indictment.Congressional candidates are required to file sworn financial disclosures before an election, which give a full accounting of that candidate’s finances, like their assets and income.As part of his first congressional race in 2020, Santos filed two disclosures with the House that contained false statements. Santos claimed in the reports that he had earned $55,000 in salary, commission and bonuses from a company, identified in the indictment only as “Company #2.”Santos also reported in the 2020 disclosure that the only compensation he received exceeding $5,000 from a single source was an “unspecified commission bonus from Company #2.”Prosecutors say, however, that Santos only received $27,555 from Company #2. Santos also allegedly failed to disclose altogether a salary he earned from an unidentified investment firm.The behavior continued when Santos filed his 2022 disclosure in that election – which he went on to win – according to the indictment.Santos wrote on the form that in 2021 and 2022 his “earned income consisted of $750,000 in salary from the Devolder Organization LLC,” that his “unearned income included dividends from the Devolder Organization LLC valued at between $1,000,001 and $5,000,000” and that “he had no compensation exceeding $5,000 from a single source in which he had an ownership interest.”The then-candidate also claimed on the 2022 form that he “owned a checking account with deposits totaling between $100,001 and $250,000” and “a savings account with deposits totaling between $1,000,001 and $5,000,000,” prosecutors said.“Contrary to these statements, in truth and in fact, as Santos then and there well knew and believed, he had not received from the Devolder Organization LLC the reported amounts of salary or dividends; he did not maintain checking or savings accounts with deposits in the reported amounts; and he received approximately $28,107 in income from (an investment firm Santos worked at) and approximately $20,304 in unemployment insurance benefits from (New York) during the same reporting period, all of which he failed to report as required,” the indictment said.As Santos faced multiple investigations earlier this year, a number of top Democrats and some Republicans called for him to step down from his seat, with those calls restarting Tuesday after CNN reported that he had been indicted.Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who has been one of the most outspoken Santos critics inside the party, said to CNN on Tuesday: “I reiterate my call that he should resign.”Another New York Republican, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, told CNN, “I’m not surprised. I understand this is where it was headed.”Malliotakis emphasized on Tuesday that she needed to see the charges, but asked whether Santos should be removed from Congress she said: “I would love to see someone new run because I can tell you that we will hold that seat and so the sooner Santos leaves, the sooner we can get someone in there that is not a liar.”Other Republicans said it should be up to Santos’ district to decide his fate in Congress.National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer said “his constituents will deal with whatever issue.”This story has been updated with additional developments.",politics,0.0
441,465,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/george-santos-criminal-charges-explainer/index.html,What to know about the charges against George Santos and what happens next,2023-05-10 18:35:00,"Rep. George Santos has been charged in a federal criminal probe that – from a legal standpoint – won’t affect his status as a member of Congress but will ensnare him in a potentially yearslong court process that could result in a sentence of several years in prison.The Long Island congressman, who has an extraordinary trail of falsehoods that emerged soon after he was elected and helped cement the narrow GOP House majority, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges that range from wire fraud to theft of public money to false statements on his House disclosure reports.Santos is accused of funneling contributions meant to support his campaigns into his personal bank accounts, from where it was spent on luxury clothes and paying off debt. Prosecutors also allege he fraudulently applied for and received Covid-related unemployment benefits while receiving a six-figure salary working for an investment firm.If convicted of the top counts in the indictment, Santos faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, according to the Justice Department, though it’s more likely he’d receive a much lesser sentence.Here’s what to know about the significance of the charges and what happens next:The indictment lays out three main buckets of alleged criminal activity by Santos.The first scheme described by prosecutors are alleged false representations made by Santos to political donors that led them to make contributions that were not ultimately used to support his campaign. That alleged scheme has prompted five counts of wire fraud and three counts of unlawful monetary transactions.The second set of accusations concern Santos’ allegedly false applications for unemployment benefits, resulting in a theft of public money count and two more wire fraud counts.False statements that Santos is accused of making on financial disclosures he filed in the House led to two additional counts.Shanlon Wu, a white collar defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor, noted on CNN’s “Inside Politics” on Wednesday that the alleged fraud took place over a varied collection of supposed schemes, making it a tough case for Santos to mount a defense against.“They’re actually all so different. He doesn’t have a single unifying theme, like, ‘oh I misunderstood the unemployment benefits, I didn’t realize I couldn’t raise money falsely for my campaign.’ It’s so diverse,” Wu said.Prosecutors say Santos lied in documents submitted to Congress about the size and sources of his income in both of his bids for the US House of Representatives.It’s against the law to make false statements on the financial disclosure reports that all congressional candidates and federal lawmakers must file, and the investigation appears to have uncovered more details about Santos’ true financial picture.Ever since his surprise election win last fall, Santos has faced questions about his representation that he earned big sums in 2022 from a firm he had established, a dramatic change in his financial circumstances after reporting no assets and a salary of just $55,000 in his failed House bid just two years earlier.The charging documents made public Wednesday claim Santos misrepresented his actual income in both campaigns and inflated his income and assets ahead of the 2022 election, falsely claiming a paycheck of $750,000 from his firm, the Devolder Organization, and purporting to have a savings account worth between $1 million and $5 million.None of that was true, prosecutors say. Instead, Santos earned $28,107 from an investment firm ahead of the 2022 election and a little more than $20,000 in unemployment insurance benefits “all of which he failed to report as required,” according to the complaint.Erin Chlopak, senior director of campaign finance with the Campaign Legal Center watchdog group, said these financial disclosures are crucial to helping voters understand candidates and potential financial conflicts of interest with the offices they are seeking.“Where (candidates) get their money from is part of the picture that voters assess,” she said. “When someone lies about it, voters are misled and potentially duped into making a different decision.”If the case against Santos does go to trial, prosecutors have indicated they have financial records, text messages and other forms of evidence to support their case.Prosecutors aren’t required to show their full hand at the charging phase, so it could be that the new indictment is just a preview of what investigators have collected.The indictment suggests that investigators have obtained emails and texts messages where Santos allegedly made false representations that led to contributions to what donors thought were entities that were supporting this campaign.“It appears that they have pretty strong documentary evidence” and are not relying on circumstantial evidence to establish motives, Chlopak said. The Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint against Santos with election regulators in January and urged the Justice Department to investigate his actions.The speed at which the probe has moved indicates “how easy of an investigation it’s been, up until this point,” Wu said.Key to the alleged scheme was an individual identified in the indictment as “Person 1,” who is described as a “political consultant operating in Queens County and the surrounding areas.” The charging papers indicate that investigators have texts and emails that individual sent to contributors, too, and prosecutors may also have that person’s testimony. The indictment describes that person taking certain actions to allegedly further the scheme “at the direction” of Santos and testimony would flesh out that allegation.It appears prosecutors also have financial records that would allegedly show that the political contributions that were wired to an entity identified as “Company 1” – which is described in the indictment as a Florida LLC, for which Santos’ company is listed as a manager.  Transfers were then allegedly made from Company 1 to Santos’ personal bank accounts, and financial records would also help back those accusations.Prosecutors allege Santos spent the money on “luxury designer clothing, credit card payments, a car payment, payments on personal debts,” as well as with cash withdrawals and transfers to associates. Those are allegations prosecutors may seek to prove to the jury through receipts or other evidence of the alleged purchases.To establish the alleged unemployment fraud scheme, investigators likely have the attestations Santos allegedly made to participate in the public benefits program. The federal and state agencies that administer the pandemic benefits program are thanked in DOJ’s press release for their assistance. The indictment suggests investigators also obtained bank records indicating that Santos allegedly was receiving regular deposits from a $120,000 per year salary while he was said to have been enrolled in the unemployment program.The House disclosure documents that Santos allegedly lied on are publicly available documents. Many of the same financial records prosecutors say they have obtained to establish the other alleged crimes appear to support their accusations that he made false statements on the forms.On Wednesday afternoon, Santos made his first appearance in court, pleaded not guilty and was released on a $500,000 bond. He had to surrender his passport and will need court approval to travel beyond New York and Washington, DC.The proceedings will now enter a pre-trial phase that could stretch out for several months. Santos’ lawyers will have the chance to ask that his case be dismissed. If the judge declines to and rules that the case can advance towards trial, there will be pretrial litigation over what kind of evidence the prosecutors can put before the jury and what kind of defense Santos can mount in response. Other procedural disputes may well come up in this phase.There’s also the potential that, instead of a jury trial, Santos seeks a bench trial – i.e. a trial before just the judge.At any point, it’s possible that Santos and the Justice Department could reach a plea deal that would make a trial unnecessary. If the case goes to trial and Santos is ultimately convicted, he will have a chance to appeal the verdict.A criminal indictment does not automatically lead to removal from Congress.There are no federal laws that affect the status of a lawmaker who has been charged with – or even found guilty of – a felony.  Despite calls to resign from many Democrats and some Republicans in New York state, Santos has so far resisted those efforts.Lawmakers can opt for expulsion to remove a convicted House member, but it’s a rare occurrence. Only five members of the House have been removed – and just two since the aftermath of the Civil War. The sanction requires a two-thirds vote.The most recent case involved Ohio Democrat Jim Traficant, who was convicted in 2002 on bribery, racketeering and tax evasion charges. Later that year, he was expelled from the House by a 420-1 vote.",politics,0.0

But here I am, back in the office and going to work. Not a full schedule yet, but I’ll get there pretty soon.”First elected to Congress in 2012, Kildee represents Michigan’s 8th Congressional District and is co-chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.",politics,0.0

Earlier, leadership recessed the floor ahead of the planned rule vote as they worked to find a path forward.Final passage is scheduled for Thursday – a vote strategically timed to coincide with the expiration of Title 42, a pandemic-era policy that allowed certain migrants to be turned away at the border.Republican leaders worked for months to negotiate the border and immigration package, a signature piece of legislation and an issue they ran on in the midterms.But they were still running into last-minute pockets of opposition on the day before the vote and worked behind the scenes to resolve the impasse.One issue had been over language that asks the secretary of homeland security to issue a report determining whether Mexican cartels are a “foreign terrorist organization.” Some Republicans are pushing leadership to take it out of the bill, concerned it could create a new “credible fear” claim for asylum seekers.Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, told CNN that he knew of at least five Republicans who are “hard no” votes if the provision remains.“It’s stupid, it’s counterproductive,” Crenshaw said of the foreign terrorist organization language. “That’s what people are rebelling against.”Florida Rep. Byron Donalds confirmed that leaders will be tweaking the bill to address members’ concern, including an amendment to change the foreign terrorist organization language.By late Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Andrew Clyde said he was a “yes” on the bill after saying his concerns over “foreign terrorist organization” had been addressed, though he did not elaborate further.Virginia Rep. Bob Good, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told CNN he was also among the Republicans pushing for changes to the FTO language, and had communicated his concerns to leadership.He said he’d be able to support the border bill if the language is removed or changed.There were also still lingering concerns over a provision in the bill to expand E-verify, a database employers use to verify immigration status. Republicans representing districts with agriculture were worried that without reworking the agricultural visa program, the provision could make it more difficult for rural farmers to find a pipeline of workers.A handful of Republicans representing agricultural-heavy districts had thought the issue had been resolved with leadership and that the bill would be updated to include language that would study the implications of E-Verify before the program was required. That minor change was supposed to happen in the Rules Commitee, but a source familiar told CNN that some conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus were opposed and the amendment wasn’t added. That caused further heartburn Wednesday as leaders were trying to cement support for the bill.Democrats are not expected to back the measure, meaning Republicans can only afford to lose four votes.Rep. Tim Burchett said late Wednesday afternoon he is “leaning favorably” and predicted there are only two remaining Republican holdouts on the issue of E-verify.GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents a Texas border district, told CNN as he left House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s office earlier in the day that he is not sure if he will support the GOP border bill.“That’s a damn good question,” he told reporters.Gonzales has been a long holdout on the package but had recently expressed he would support the deal that became the final package.Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, who represents an agriculture district, said he could get to yes on the bill if there is an amendment requiring a report studying the impacts of the E-verify on the workforce before the provision is implemented.“We’re still talking about an amendment,” he said. “I think we’re getting really close.”Later on Wednesday, Newhouse, in a tweet, said that House GOP leadership has committed to addressing his issues on E-verify in the package and will now support the package.House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green told CNN he did not think the language of the bill would be changing any further, but in a sign of how in flux negotiations are, he added, “that could change in the next half hour.”Even though he said he did not know if there is enough support for the package Green projected confidence telling CNN, “what I’m hearing is we are good to go.”Green said he thought the issues relating to language addressing foreign terrorist organizations were addressed with members in their conference meeting Wednesday morning.“I think we addressed that in conference this morning to everybody. We brought up how the asylum laws are written now and made pretty clear that it’s a government that has to be oppressing that person or threatening that person and we also put in this language that says nothing in this would construe the asylum is granted because they get named as foreign terrorist organizations,” he added.The GOP border bill, which is dead on arrival in the Senate, would restart construction of the border wall, increase funding for border agents and upgraded border technology, reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy, place new restrictions on asylum seekers, and enhance requirements for E-verify.",politics,0.0
444,468,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/hunter-biden-house-judiciary/index.html,House Republicans say CIA staffer helped seek support for statement from former intel officials questioning Hunter Biden laptop story,2023-05-10 16:56:00,"House Republicans are demanding more information on how Central Intelligence Agency employees interacted with a group of former intelligence officials as they organized a 2020 public statement that questioned whether a laptop with Hunter Biden emails and documents was part of a Russian disinformation operation.House Judiciary Republicans say in a new report that one of the letter’s signers told committee investigators that a staff member at the CIA asked him about signing onto the effort.The assertion is part of a 65-page interim report that Republicans on the committee released Wednesday. The report comes as House Republicans continue to dig into the October 2020 public letter that stated that the appearance of the Hunter Biden laptop story on the political scene had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” Though the former officials acknowledged in their public letter that they did “not have evidence of Russian involvement,” Republicans have argued that the letter helped discredit the laptop story just before the election in support of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.Former CIA official David Cariens told the committee via email that he was in the process of getting a book of his approved by the CIA’s publications review board in 2020 when the individual in charge of approving his work asked if he wanted to sign onto the letter framing the Hunter Biden laptop story as Russian disinformation, according to the report. At the time, the letter about the Hunter Biden laptop story was also under review by the review board.“When the person in charge of reviewing the book called to say it was approved with no changes, I was told about the draft letter,” Cariens said, the report said.Cariens added that after being read certain portions of the letter, “I agreed to sign.”To follow up on Cariens’ claims, committee Republicans sent a letter to CIA Director William J. Burns on March 21 requesting documents by April 4 on how the CIA interacted with former employees, such as Cariens, over the letter which was eventually signed by 51 former intelligence officials. The CIA has “failed to respond to this request,” according to the report from committee Republicans obtained by CNN.The report also states, “the committees will continue to pursue additional information about the actions and events described in this report.”“The role of CIA’s Pre-Publication Review Board (PCRB) is to review materials submitted by current and former officers to determine if the materials contain any classified information,” a CIA spokesperson said when CNN asked about the allegation in the interim report.House Democrats on the Judiciary panel released their own report discrediting allegations Republicans are making about the CIA as the result of Cariens’ singular email.Former CIA service officer Marc Polymeropoulos called into question Cariens’ account of being called on the phone by the publications review board in testimony revealed by the Democrats.“I would never take any kind of approval over the phone. That would mean nothing to me,” he said, adding that a phone call approval like Cariens described “doesn’t seem plausible.”Democrats also produced the email from Cariens confirming he wanted to sign onto the letter and pointed out that it did not mention any phone conversation he had with a publications review board official.Democrats on the panel also raised questions about why Republicans have not brought Cariens in for an interview.“Let’s call this report what it is: another blatant attempt by Jim Jordan to mislead the American people,” said Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerrold Nadler.“Jordan’s claim that the CIA promoted this letter is not justified by his investigation,” said House Intelligence committee ranking member Jim Himes.Ian Sams, White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, said in a statement, “Instead of working with President Biden on the issues that matter most to the American people, House Republicans are weaponizing their power to go after their political opponents and re-litigate the 2020 election with misleading claims.”“The American people see these House GOP attacks for what they are: political stunts intended to hurt President Biden,” he said.CNN has reached out to Cariens for comment.Former deputy director for the CIA and one of the former intelligence officials who signed the public letter, Michael Morell previously testified to the panel that he did not know about Cariens’ encounter but had he known, “I would have reacted very negatively to this.”“It’s inappropriate for a currently serving staff officer or contractor to be involved in the political process,” Morell said, according to an excerpt of his interview included in the report.Another former CIA service officer Marc Polymeropoulos told the committee in an interview included in the report that if Cariens’ claims are true “it would concern me.”“This is something that the (Prepublication Classification Review Board) in my experience would never engage in something like that. They are just straightforward back and forth in terms of approval. The idea they would have a comment on any other thing that they were working on, that to me is not even close to what I’ve experienced with them,” Polymeropoulos said.The report also further discussed how the letter was also intended to help support Biden’s presidency.  Morrell told the committee the intent of the letter was twofold: to share shares about the potential of Russia’s role in the issue and “help Vice President Biden in the debate.”This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
445,469,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/politics/comer-bank-records-biden-family-members-payments-foreign-entities/index.html,House Republicans allege Biden family members received millions in payments from foreign entities in new bank records report,2023-05-10 16:24:00,"House Oversight Chairman James Comer laid out new details to support allegations that members of Joe Biden’s family including his son Hunter received millions of dollars in payments from foreign entities in China and Romania including when Biden was vice president, according to a memo obtained by CNN.New bank records cited in the memo were obtained by the committee through a subpoena and include payments made to companies tied to Hunter Biden. Republicans also alleged that Hunter Biden used his familial connections to help facilitate a meeting in 2016 between a Serbian running for United Nations Secretary-General and then-national security adviser to the vice president Colin Kahl.The foreign payments raise questions about Hunter Biden’s business activities while his father was vice president, but the committee does not suggest any illegality about the payments from foreign sources. The bank records by themselves also do not indicate the purpose of the payments that were made.The memo marks Comer’s most direct attempt to substantiate his allegations that Biden family members have enriched themselves off the family name. Comer has suggested that Biden may have been improperly influenced by the financial dealings, particularly by his family’s foreign business partners.But the latest report does not show any payments made directly to Joe Biden, either as vice president or after leaving office.Comer has been publicly teasing information for months about the paper trail committee Republicans have uncovered through subpoenas sent to multiple banks and trips to the Treasury Department to review records.Comer and other Republicans on the committee held a press conference Wednesday morning to tout their findings.“These people didn’t come to Hunter Biden because he understood world politics or that he was experienced in it, or that he understood Chinese businesses. They wanted him for the access his last name gave him,” Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, said during the news conference.On Wednesday, Comer was asked about specific policy decisions Biden made while president or vice president that may have been directly influenced by these foreign payments. Comer failed to name any and instead pointed to then-vice president Biden traveling around the world and discussing foreign aid in the last year of the Obama administration, and added they think there are decisions Biden made as president that “put China first and America last.” Comer said the committee “will get into more of those later.”Ahead of the memo’s release, White House spokesperson Ian Sams said in a statement to CNN, “Congressman Comer has a history of playing fast and loose with the facts and spreading baseless innuendo while refusing to conduct his so-called ‘investigations’ with legitimacy. He has hidden information from the public to selectively leak and promote his own hand-picked narratives as part of his overall effort to lob personal attacks at the President and his family.”Abbe Lowell, counsel for Hunter Biden, said in a statement, “Today’s so-called “revelations” are retread, repackaged misstatements of perfectly proper meetings and business by private citizens. Instead of redoing old investigations that found no evidence of wronging by Mr. Biden, Rep. Comer should do the same examination of the many entities of former President Trump and his family members.”The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said in a statement to CNN, “Chairman Comer has failed to provide factual evidence to support his wild accusations about the President. He continues to bombard the public with innuendo, misrepresentations, and outright lies, recycling baseless claims from stories that were debunked years ago.”Bank records cited in the committee’s memo show that within five weeks of then-Vice President Biden’s meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in 2015, a Romanian who Hunter Biden was doing legal consulting for, Gabriel Popoviciu, started sending money to Rob Walker, a business associate of Hunter’s.Walker received more than $3 million from November 2015 to May 2017 and wired approximately $1 million in various installments to Hunter Biden, his business associate James Gillian, and Hallie Biden, the widow of the president’s oldest son, Beau Biden who died in May 2015. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were romantically involved for a period after Beau’s death.It has long been known that Hunter Biden did legal work for Popoviciu, a wealthy Romanian business executive who was convicted in 2016 on corruption charges.Comer’s memo raises questions about why Popoviciu was paying a Biden family business associate directly instead of the law firm where Hunter Biden worked at the time or the other firm Hunter reportedly referred Popoviciu to.Former President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani was also involved with Popoviciu, which Comer’s memo does not mention.Committee Republicans obtained the bank records from subpoenas to four different banks.The report also alleges that in 2016, Vuk Jeremic, a Serbian politician who was running for UN secretary-general, tried to use his business relationship with Hunter Biden and his associates to get a meeting with Kahl, who was then an aide in Biden’s vice president’s office.In a June 2016 email, Jeremic wrote to Hunter Biden and a business associate, Eric Schwerin, asking to “meet with VPOTUS National Security Advisor Colin Kahl” related to the UN secretary-general election.Schwerin instructed Hunter Biden to “Think about how you want to respond,” according to the report.In a July 2016 email, Jeremic followed up via email saying, “[m]y meeting with Colin did not last very long, but didn’t go too bad, I think. What is suboptimal is that OVP seems to be outside the decision-making loop on the UNSG elections issue. Colin promised to get better informed on what’s going on at the moment,” according to the report.Republicans said they intend to pursue more communications related to the matter, but concluded it appears that “a Biden administration official met with Jeremic to discuss the UN Secretary General election at the direction of Hunter Biden and/or his business associates.”Kahl did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jeremic’s attorneys told the committee in a letter last month he would not cooperate with a request for documents and testimony due to separation of powers issues and because House rules limit subpoenas to people “within the United States.”The memo also alleges that two Chinese nationals made payments of $100,000 to Hunter Biden’s professional corporation through a Chinese-backed energy company. Republicans claim that at least one of those individuals had ties to the Communist Party of China. These transactions, as well as Hunter Biden’s relationship with a Chinese-backed energy company once his father left the VP’s office, have long been known.The memo alleges that the two Chinese nationals were connected to CEFC, a Chinese energy conglomerate that had a business relationship with Hunter Biden.Committee Republicans claim one of the individuals “used CEFC to bribe and corruptly influence foreign officials.”The memo includes a copy of a bank transaction showing that on August 4, 2017, CEFC Infrastructure wired $100,000 to Owasco P.C, Hunter Biden’s professional corporation.The memo also includes details from the bank records on how money was moved between companies, including a $100,000 payment to one of Hunter Biden’s companies that was then funded by a Chinese based firm tied to CEFC.Comer alleges the transaction “disproves President Biden’s claim that his family received no money from China.”In the report, the committee acknowledges there “exist legitimate commercial transactions with China-based entities and individuals.”“However, the pattern of behavior engaged in by the Bidens and their Chinese counterparties—memorialized in relevant bank records—signals an attempt to layer companies and cloud the source of money,” the committee alleges.Comer has previously revealed that members of Biden’s family received just over $1 million indirectly from State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company.Senate Republicans in 2020 first detailed how Walker made wire transfers to companies associated with Hunter Biden and president’s brother, James, after receiving a $3 million wire from the Chinese company.The latest GOP memo claims Walker also sent some of that money to Hallie Biden and an unknown bank account identified as “Biden.”Committee Republicans said they are continuing to trace bank records and have written to additional witnesses involved in certain transactions to request documents as well as interviews.According to the report, Republicans intend to pursue legislative changes – a key step needed to justify their investigation if fights over subpoenas head to court.Those changes include laws that require additional reporting about the finances of a president or vice president’s family members, public disclosure of foreign transactions involving the family members of senior elected officials and an expedited law enforcement review of any suspicious bank activity reports related to a president or vice president’s immediately family members.Comer left the door open on whether his committee would investigate the foreign business dealings of former President Donald Trump and his family ahead of making any legislative recommendations to address influence peddling. To date however, Comer has not looked into Trump’s financial dealings or pursued an investigation into the classified documents that he had at Mar-a-Lago.“We’re going to look at everything when we get ready to introduce the legislation to ban influence peddling” Comer said. “This has been a pattern for a long time. Republicans and Democrats have both complained about Presidents’ families receiving money.”On the foreign business dealings of Trump’s son-in law, Jared Kushner, specifically, Comer said, “I’m not saying whether I agreed with what he did or not, but I actually know what his businesses are. What are the Biden businesses?”This story has been updated with additional reporting.",politics,0.0

It’s the first visit to China by an Australian trade minister since 2019.In a statement, the minister said he would work to resolve “outstanding” blocks on the flow of goods between the two countries.“I will be advocating strongly for the full resumption of unimpeded Australian exports to China — for all sectors — to the benefit of both countries,” he added.The visit underscores how Australia is seeking to improve ties with Beijing after a change of leadership in Canberra last year and as the world’s second largest economy reopens.China is Australia’s largest trading partner, with the exchange of goods between the two countries worth 287 billion Australian dollars ($192 billion) in 2022, according to Australian government statistics. Australia plays a vital role to China as a key supplier of commodities such as iron ore.But the two sides locked horns in the spring of 2020 as Canberra, led by then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison, called for an international investigation into the roots of Covid-19, which angered Beijing.Since then, China has curbed imports of a wide range of Australian products, including beef, barley, wine and coal through heavy taxes or other barriers. As a result, Australian exports to China fell by 13% in 2022, compared to the previous year, according to Chinese customs data.But relations began to improve after Anthony Albanese became prime minister last May, leading to “the resumption of coal, cotton, and copper trade,” noted Farrell.Data shows a big upswing. In March, Australia’s exports to China hit a record high, with the value of shipments reaching 19 billion Australian dollars ($12.8 billion).Last month, Australia’s foreign ministry pointed to restrictions on the sale of Australian barley, saying that “since 2020, China’s 80.5% duties on Australian barley have effectively blocked exports to that market.”Annual barley sales to China had been worth 916 million Australian dollars, or $613 million, before the dispute, the ministry said.Canbera has challenged the duties, lodging a complaint with the World Trade Organization in 2020.But last month, in a gesture of goodwill, Australia agreed to suspend its case, saying China had agreed to an expedited review of the measures following talks between the two sides.“If the duties are not lifted at the end of the review period, Australia will resume the dispute in the WTO,” Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said.Canberra is also continuing to press for the release of Australian TV anchor Cheng Lei, who marked 1,000 days in Chinese detention this week after being taken into custody on espionage charges. Authorities have not publicly detailed the allegations against her.China has publicly expressed its desire to move forward. At a news briefing Thursday, its foreign ministry said the country “stands ready to work together with Australia.”",world,0.0
447,471,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/media/oklahoma-pbs-oeta-reliable-sources/index.html,Oklahoma governor wages war on PBS station after claiming it is indoctrinating children with LGBTQ content,2023-05-12 00:35:00,"America’s most-watched PBS station is on the verge of going dark.The Republican governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, recently vetoed a bill that would have renewed the license and provided millions in funding for the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority, the statewide PBS network that reaches more than 650,000 viewers a week. Stitt took issue with what he alleged was LGBTQ-inclusive programming on the station, claiming to Fox News that it amounted to the “indoctrination and over-sexualization of our children.”“It doesn’t line up with Oklahoma values,” Stitt told the right-wing network this week in an interview about the decision.The move from Stitt to attack the home of family friendly programs such as “Sesame Street,” “Clifford the Big Red Dog,” and “Mister Rogers” is representative of a new and quickly expanding front in the culture wars. Republicans, most prominently Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have over the last year laced into Disney, claiming the intentionally inoffensive brand is really a “creepy” company engaged in “grooming” children with radical gender ideology. That strain of attack is now spreading to PBS.A spokesperson for the public broadcaster defended its programming, saying it provides “curriculum-based content that for generations has educated and inspired children in Oklahoma and across the country.”“The threat to funding puts Oklahoma families at risk of losing access to the local free content they trust to help kids reach their full potential. The fundamental goal of PBS KIDS remains supporting children as they learn and grow through programming they have come to know and love. Now is not the time to take that away from any child,” the spokesperson said.While rhetoric from politicians can often be empty and merely aimed at exciting supporters, the anti-LGBTQ rhetoric from the GOP is leading in recent months to real actionable consequences. Cheered on by the most powerful entities in right-wing media, politicians like Stitt and DeSantis are moving to use the power of the state to punish organizations for their inclusivity.While the Oklahoma station receives $6.3 million in funding from donors and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, $2.9 million comes from the state government. If Stitt’s veto is not overridden by the state legislature, it would send the station into uncharted territory and could prompt painful decisions to be made.Not only is OETA the home of educational children’s programming, but it also plays an important civic role. It produces and airs the “Oklahoma News Report,” the only state news program that reaches every county in Oklahoma. And, crucially, it is the broadcast network that state authorities rely on to disseminate emergency alerts to the public, including for severe weather, a frequent and dangerous occurrence in the Tornado Alley state. In just the last year alone, the network has transmitted more than 200 emergency alerts.State Sen. Carri Hicks, a Democrat who represents Oklahoma City, blasted Stitt’s decision, saying she is “deeply disappointed that the governor has decided to politicize an institution that is so meaningful to generations of Oklahomans.”“I grew up in a rural community where we did not have access to cable or satellite television, but I did have high-quality educational content on PBS,” Hicks said in a statement. “Because of OETA, I spent my afternoons after school practicing math and reading. Our governor wants to rob our children of that programming and opportunity to learn just so that he can score some political points. It is truly a shame and a disservice to the people of Oklahoma.”Bob Spinks, a board member and past president of the Friends of OETA non-profit, also spoke out against the governor’s move.“Since we are Oklahoma’s only statewide television broadcasting system, serving all citizens in the 77 counties in our state, the loss of OETA will leave an enormous gap in providing educational programming, public safety support, and civic engagement for the hundreds of thousands who depend on us weekly,” Spinks told CNN.“I am not sure of how it will develop if the veto isn’t overridden,” Spinks candidly said. “Clearly, there could be an effect on emergency alert capability.”“But since we’ve never faced this before,” Spinks added, “we just don’t know.”- CNN’s Jon Passantino contributed to this report",business,0.0

She is a self-proclaimed “fat activist” who has found her voice as a content creator online, but has concerns about applying for new job.“Walking into a job interview as a fat person, I’m already at a disadvantage,” said Victoria Abraham. “I know that whatever my qualifications are, my weight is a con.”But on Thursday, the New York City council passed a bill that would make it illegal to discriminate against height and weight in housing, employment, and public accommodations.“I know that at least when I get a job, if I’m experiencing this discrimination, I have someone supporting me. I have the support of the government; I have legal protection where there wasn’t any before,” said Abraham.Only six other cities and one state have similar laws protecting Americans against height and weight discrimination: Binghamton, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; Urbana, Illinois; Washington, DC; San Francisco and Santa Cruz, California; and Michigan.Weight discrimination is widespread, but hits women the hardest – particularly women of color.Women considered obese earned $5.25 less per hour than women considered normal weight, according to a Vanderbilt University study. Discrimination based on weight is also comparable to the levels of racial discrimination in the United States, according to the American Journal of Public Health.“It’s not only protecting people in the workplace from this or in getting apartments, but it’s also about changing culture,” said Shaun Abreu, a New York City Councilman, and the lead sponsor of the bill.Abreu said a version of the bill existed before he came on board. But after facing his own weight discrimination, he took the lead.“Just recently someone who I considered to be a friend came up to me and touched my stomach and said, ‘we’re getting bigger there buddy.’ And it just speaks to the toxic culture that exists in the United States when it comes to people that are above their average peers weight,” said Abreu.Jennifer Portnick is a veteran fitness instructor, teaching 17 fitness classes a week. But she still remembers the time she applied for her first job at Jazzercize in San Francisco 22 years ago.“I was invited to go to tryouts where the regional manager is kind of behind you watching you dance. And after class she told me, you are going be fantastic,” recalls Portnick.She just needed to do one more thing: Take a photo holding out her arms, parallel to the floor, which was then sent to the corporate office.What came back wasn’t a job offer, but a letter that read, in part, “you have all the all the qualifications for a potential trainee except for the fitness level required… Consequently, a Jazzercize applicant must have a higher muscle to fat ratio and look leaner than the public,” the letter continued.Portnick, who was stunned, wanted to make a change. She got that chance thanks to a law in San Francisco banning discrimination in housing and employment based on height and weight, with the help of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission.After six months of negotiations with Portnick, Jazzercize changed their policy, ending the requirement that an instructor has to look “leaner than the public.”“If it hadn’t been for the law, I’m sure that I wouldn’t have had the outcome that I did,” Portnick said.More than 20 years later, similar laws have been slow to be adopted nationwide. New Jersey, New York state, and Massachusetts are currently looking at similar legislation. Fat activists are hopeful this New York City bill will be a catalyst for other cities and states to follow suit.“San Francisco is often a cultural lead in the country, and it’s really too bad that didn’t spread wider than it has. But I am super excited about New York City’s efforts. I would love to see it ripple out through the rest of the country as more of a standard than as a one-off,” said Portnick.Discrimination is hard to prove in any class, whether it be race, age, sexual orientation, gender, and now, weight and height.As part of the bill, job descriptions that require a certain height or weight to perform a job would be considered in any discrimination case.“If there’s a job requirement where weight is related to the essential function of the job, then that’s an affirmative defense that an employer will have,” said Abreu.The Partnership of New York City, which represents the interests of small businesses in New York City, argues the bill is overly broad, opening businesses up to costly litigation.“The extent of the impact and cost of this legislation has not been fully considered,” said Kathy Wylde, President and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, in a statement.Several leaders in the fat activism community spoke at a hearing on the bill last month about their personal encounters with weight discrimination.“Testimony at the hearing talked about the problems overweight people face sitting in restaurant and theater seats, bikes having a weight limit, taxi cabs requiring seat belt extenders. All of these things could be considered discrimination under this bill and require costly modifications to avoid fines and lawsuits,” said Wylde.",politics,0.0
450,474,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/economy/debt-ceiling-trump-fact-check/index.html,Here’s how we know a US default would be an economic disaster,2023-05-11 17:15:00,"In CNN’s town hall with Donald Trump on Wednesday, the former president said a US default on its debt may be “psychological” and that it “could be nothing” or perhaps just “a bad week or a bad day.”Economists disagree; many of them.As the political impasse continues and the country inches closer to the day the government will no longer be able to meet all of its financial obligations, a slew of economists have released estimates on what the economic impact of a US debt default would look like. Those estimates have all been grim.If the United States defaults on its debt, it would undermine faith in the federal government’s ability to pay all its bills on time, affecting the government’s credit rating and unleashing massive turbulence in financial markets.The United States was in a similar situation in 2011 when it got close to defaulting. In that instance, S&P Global Ratings credit rating agency downgraded the government from AAA to AA+ credit rating. The federal government maintains a perfect credit rating from Fitch and Moody’s, but that could change as the stalemate drags on.Investors care about stability and predictability, so a credit rating downgrade would send a chill down Wall Street’s spine. Except, some market tensions have already manifested. Yields on Treasury bills for early June, when the Treasury Department could exhaust its cash and extraordinary measures, have soared this month. Borrowing costs for credit card rates and mortgage rates would spike, since US debt serves as a critical benchmark for various forms of debt. That leaves Americans having to pay more to borrow —  on top of the Federal Reserve’s own rate hikes.“Worsening expectations regarding a possible default would make significant disruptions in financial markets increasingly probable,” Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner of the Brookings Institution wrote in an analysis. “Such financial market disruptions would very likely be coupled with declines in the price of equities, a loss of consumer and business confidence, and a contraction in access to private credit markets.”Americans’ investments would take a major hit as stocks lose as much as a third of their value, wiping out around $12 trillion in household wealth, according to Moody’s Analytics.The broadest economic impact of a US debt default would be a recession that would encompass the global economy, including sharp job losses.“A default would threaten the gains that we’ve worked so hard to make over the past few years in our pandemic recovery. And it would spark a global downturn that would set us back much further,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday in Japan, where she is attending a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers.In a scenario in which the government’s default persists for months, that could mean 7.4 million job losses in the United States, according to Moody’s Analytics. California would lose 841,600 jobs, Texas would shed 561,700 jobs and there would be 474,700 jobs lost in Florida.And the housing market would not be spared by the “economic calamity” of a US government default, as Yellen once described it.A new analysis from Zillow estimated that housing costs would soar by 22%, with the rate for 30-year, fixed rate mortgages rising above 8%, and existing home sales would fall by 23% at their lowest point if there is debt default.“A lot of things we assume are part of our financial fabric would get ripped away,” Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CNN in an interview on Thursday.“It’s a big worry. Every family should be concerned,” he said. “From our own knowledge and oversight of the banking system, we know that everyone is extremely concerned. Corporate America, Main Street, all of it could be affected.”If the US government were to default on its obligations, it would quickly have a major financial impact on tens of millions of Americans.About 66 million retirees, disabled workers and others receive monthly Social Security benefits. These payments could be delayed if Treasury doesn’t have enough funds — about $25 billion a week — on hand.Almost two-thirds of beneficiaries rely on Social Security for half their income, and for 40% of recipients, the payments constitute at least 90% of their income, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.More than 2 million federal civilian workers and around 1.4 million active-duty military members could see their paychecks delayed. Federal government contractors could also see a lag in payments, which could impact their ability to compensate their workers. Certain veterans’ benefits, including disability payments and pensions for some low-income veterans and their surviving families, could be affected.About $25 billion in pay or benefits for active-duty members of the military, civil service and military retirees, veterans and recipients of Supplemental Security Income is sent out on the first day of the month, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Delays in these payments would ripple through the economy since consumers would have less money to spend and their confidence would be shaken. This would be especially true in areas with many senior citizens and lower-income residents.What’s more, many federal government payments that flow to states, municipalities, people and others could be affected, which would have economic consequences. Food stamps and unemployment benefits could be interrupted.Disruptions to Medicare and Medicaid payments would hurt health care providers, particularly smaller hospitals and doctors’ offices that operate on slim profit margins, a recent Moody’s Analytics report said. If the impasse dragged on, these providers may become less willing to treat patients covered by the government programs.— CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report.",business,0.0

Affected customers should contact the company for a free repair kit that they can install themselves.In a press release, Peloton said that the $1,400 bikes were sold from January 2018 to May 2023 in the United Sates only. It has identified 35 reports of “seat posts breaking” out of the 2,160,000 bikes sold as of April 30. The CPSC added of the 35 reports, 13 people said they were injured, including a “fractured wrist, lacerations and bruises due to falling from the bike.”“Our commitment to member safety is unwavering. For Peloton, it was important to proactively engage the CPSC to address this issue and to work swiftly and cooperatively to identify a remedy,” the company said.Shares of Peloton slid more than 6% following the news.It’s the second major recall for the exercise company, which was forced to recall 125,000 of its treadmills following the death of a six-year-old child and dozens of other reports of injuries related to its machines.Peloton was fined $19 million fine for failing to promptly report treadmill hazards and for distributing recalled treadmills the CPSC said in January.",business,0.0

Shares resumed trading and finished down about 23%.PacWest is one of several mid-size lenders that has been under intense scrutiny in the weeks since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on March 10, setting off a panic around the financial stability of similarly positioned banks.“PacWest is starting to look like the weakest link and some traders are wondering if they will fail or have a sale,” said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda.Although the deposit news is troubling, Moya said, “it might not mean the end, as they have a lot of cash on hand and currently seem positioned to weather this storm.”The LA-based bank has about $15 billion in readily available cash and just $5.2 billion in uninsured deposits.PacWest didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Following the collapse of First Republic Bank last week, PacWest saw a rush of withdrawals of uninsured deposits, prompting it to pledge more of its assets as collateral to shore up its cash position, the bank said in a regulatory filing Thursday.The update marked a notable change from a week ago, when PacWest said it had not experienced “out-of-the-ordinary deposit flows” after First Republic’s hastily arranged sale to JPMorgan Chase.At the end of March, PacWest’s total deposits stood at more than $28 billion, down from about $34 billion at the end of 2022.Other regional bank shares, including Western Alliance and Zions, were also down Thursday morning.PacWest’s stock is down about 80% this year.",business,0.0
453,477,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/investing/jamie-dimon-trump-banks-debt-ceiling/index.html,JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump doesn’t understand the debt ceiling,2023-05-11 15:55:00,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon sharply criticized former President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying the 2024 presidential candidate doesn’t understand the debt ceiling and what is at stake. It is just “one more thing he doesn’t know very much about,” Dimon told Bloomberg Television.Trump said in a CNN town hall Wednesday night that a default would be preferable to a result that doesn’t stop the government “spending money like drunken sailors.”Economists and congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle say an extended default would hurt the US economy, triggering widespread unemployment, surging interest rates and sparking a global downturn.Defaulting on the US debt would be “potentially catastrophic,” Dimon said Thursday.“The closer you get to it, you will have panic. Markets will get volatile, maybe the stock market will go down, the Treasury markets will have their own problems,” he said. “This is not good.”Dimon also expressed concerns that US creditworthiness could be downgraded, as it was during the 2011 debt limit crisis.Dimon told Bloomberg he has been hunkering down in a so-called “war room” once a week in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, for the possibility of a debt default.As the June 1 ‘X-date’ approaches — when the US Treasury could run out of cash and extraordinary measures to pay all government obligations — Dimon said he will convene his war room more often. By May 21, he expects to meet every day.He added that while he’s respectful both of Republicans and Democrats during ongoing negotiations, he’d “love to get rid of the debt ceiling thing” altogether.The whole debt ceiling situation “is very unfortunate,” he added. “It should never happen this way.”On the whole, Dimon said he doesn’t feel confident about what the second half of 2023 holds for the US economy.American consumers still have excess money in their bank accounts, he said, but they’re quickly spending it down and “the bite of that is going to happen later this year.”By that time, he added, the full impact of the Federal Reserve’s tightening regimen could be felt by the economy.“I think it’s reasonable to say that those two things are coming to fruition maybe towards the end of the year,” he said.Given the risks, “I would take a mild recession happily,” he said.He also reiterated that he is far more concerned about the toll the geopolitical climate could take on the US economy.“Ukraine, trade, Russia and our relationship with China” top his list of worries, he told Bloomberg.In April, he told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that the war in Ukraine was “the most important thing.”Those rising tensions abroad are “changing everything we think about in the world” from safety and security to food and energy, he said. “It’s changing economic relationships, it’s roiling the relationship with us and China.”Dimon also told Bloomberg he has met with the leadership of embattled US regional banks every day for the last week.“We need to finish the bank crisis,” he said. “We’ve had uncertain policy on mergers,” he said “and I think we have to assume there will be a little bit more.”Last week, JPMorgan acquired the majority of First Republic after the bank’s collapse into receivership.First Republic was the third-largest US bank to fail and came just over a month after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank set off concerns about the health of the financial sector.Still, in a bit of good news, he said mid-size banks’ fundamentals are strong.“They’re quite worried because of the run on deposits, but their financial results are good,” said Dimon. “They’re going to be okay next quarter: They’re earning money, they’ve got very good clientele, very diversified.”The Biden administration has recently pointed fingers at short-sellers who bet against the banks and profited when they fell.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during a press briefing last week that the administration is “going to closely monitor the market developments, including the short-selling pressures…on healthy banks.”Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that his agency is focused on finding “any form of misconduct” that threatens investors and capital markets.Dimon said on Thursday that the SEC has the enforcement capability to look at “what people are doing, by name, in options, derivatives and short sales.”If someone is doing something wrong like colluding or tweeting about a bank after short-selling its stock, the SEC “should go after them, and vigorously,” said Dimon. “They should be punished to the full extent that the law allows it.”",business,0.0
454,478,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/tech/google-io-event-products/index.html,"A foldable phone, new tablet and lots of AI: What Google unveiled at its big developer event",2023-05-11 14:11:00,"Google on Wednesday unveiled its latest lineup of hardware products, including its first foldable phone and a new tablet, as well as plans to roll out new AI features to its search engine and productivity tools.The updates, announced at its annual Google I/O developer conference, come as the company is simultaneously trying to push beyond its core advertising business with new devices while also racing to defend its search engine from the threat posed by a wave of new AI-powered tools.In a sign of where Google’s focus currently lies, the company spent more than 90 minutes teasing a long list of new AI features before mentioning hardware updates.Here’s what Google announced at the event.Google became the latest tech company to unveil a foldable smartphone. Like other foldables, the $1799 Pixel Fold features a vertical hinge that can be opened to reveal a tablet-like display. But Google calls the Fold the thinnest foldable on the market.“It took some clever engineering work redesigning components like our speakers, our battery and haptics,” said George Hwang, a product manager at Google, on a call ahead of the announcement. The company packed a Pixel phone into a less than 6 mm body – about two thirds of the thickness of its other Pixel phones.The Pixel Fold is very much a phone first: when it’s unfolded, it opens up into a 7.6-inch screen, and moves on Google’s custom-built 180-degree hinge. That hinge mechanism is moved out entirely from under the display to improve its dust resistance and decrease the device’s overall thickness, according to the company.The Google Fold includes features you’d find on a Pixel, such as long exposure, unblur, magic eraser, which lets users remove unwanted or distracting object. It also has Pixel Fold-specific tools such as dual-screen live translate, which lets a user communicate in another language with the help of fast audio and text translations on the outer screen.Google said it optimized its top apps to take advantage of the larger screen but “there’s still work to be done” because “optimizing for a new foldable form factor takes time,” Hwang said. “It’s a process that we’re committed to and it requires steep investment with our developer partners across Android,” Hwang added.Google is far from the first to embrace foldables, but it’s possible it waited to launch its own version until the technology became more advanced. Early versions of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, for example, had issues with the screen and most apps were not well optimized for the design.But even now, the future for foldables remains uncertain. Most apps are still not optimized for foldable devices; prices remain very high; and Google’s chief rival, Apple, has yet to embrace the option.Despite great consumer interest in foldable phones — and a resurgence in 90s-style flip phones among celebrities and TikTok influencers — the foldable market is relatively small, with Samsung dominating the category, followed by others including Motorola, Lenovo, Oppo, and Huawei. According to ABI Research, foldable and flexible displays made up about 0.7% of the smartphone market in 2021, and in 2022 expected to fall just shy of 2%.The Pixel Fold will be available in the US, UK, Germany and Japan. The company said the device will start shipping next month.On the surface, the 7a looks similar to the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, with the same pixel camera bar along the back. It comes with the typical advancements you’d expect to find with any smartphone upgrade – better display, advanced camera and longer-lasting battery. But the 7a now boasts a Tensor G2 processor and a TItan M2 security chip, which brings advanced processing and new artificial intelligence features. It also offers wireless charging for the first time on an A model.The Pixel lineup has long been known for its cameras, and the 7a is no exception. It’s packed with upgrades, including a 64-megapixel main camera – the largest sensor on a Pixel A series to date, which will help with improved image quality, low light performance and other features. It also offers a new 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera for capturing even wider shots and a new 13-megapixel front camera. For the first time, each camera enables 4K video.The 7a also supports many significant Pixel features, including unblur, magic eraser and an improved Night Sight that’s two times faster and sharper than its predecessor. It also allows users to capture long exposure and enhanced zoom.The Pixel comes in several colors, including charcoal, snow, sea and coral, and starts at $499 via the Google Store on May 10.The Pixel Series A line has long been aimed at the cost conscious who want good features at a reasonable price, but its reach is limited. Google sells between eight to 10 million of the Pixel devices each year, according to ABI Research.“Generally, the smartphones were really meant for Google to showcase how software, and now AI capabilities, could be effectively optimized on hardware and improve the Android user experience,” said David McQueen, a director at ABI Research. “Google has purposely kept volume sales limited as it also has to be mindful of its relationship with other smartphone manufacturers that use the Android OS.”While phones were a key focus at the event, Google also refreshed other parts of its hardware lineup.Google introduced the Pixel Tablet, which is intended for use around the house, from turning off the lights off in the house to setting the thermostat without getting off the couch.The tablet, which has rounded edges and corners, comes in three colors: porcelain, hazel and rose, and starts at $499. It will be available on June 20.Under the hood, the 11-inch tablet is powered by Google’s Tensor G2 chips, which bring long-lasting battery life and AI features to the device. It also offers a front-facing camera, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and a charging dock.Google is also moving forward with plans to bring AI chat features to its core search engine amid a renewed arms race over the technology in Silicon Valley.The company said it is introducing the next evolution of Google Search, which will use an AI-powered chatbot to answer questions “you never thought Search could answer” and to help get users the information they want quicker than ever.With the update, the look and feel of Google Search results will be noticeably different. When users type a query into the main search bar, they will automatically see a pop-up an AI-generated response in addition to displaying traditional results.Users can now sign up for the new Google Search, which will first launch in the United States, via the Google app or Chrome’s desktop browser. A limited number of users will have access to it in the weeks ahead, according to the company, before it scales upward.Google is expanding access to its existing chatbot Bard, which operates outside the search engine and can help users do tasks such as outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge.The tool, which was previously available to early users via a waitlist only in the US, will soon be available for all users in 120 countries and 40 languages.Google is also launching extensions for Bard from its own services, such as Gmail, Sheets and Docs, allowing users to ask questions and collaborate with the chatbot within the apps they’re using.Google also announced PaLM 2, its latest large language model to rival ChatGPT-creator OpenAI’s GPT-4.The move marks a big step forward for the technology that powers the company’s AI products and promises to be better at logic, common sense reasoning and mathematics. It can also generate specialized code in different programming languages.",business,0.0
455,479,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/business/2008-banking-crisis-comparison/index.html,"As PacWest shares dive, are we seeing the 2008 financial crisis all over again?",2023-05-11 13:44:00,"If the current banking crisis looks like ’08, sounds like ‘08 and feels like ‘08, is it ‘08 all over again? Using abductive reasoning, the answer is yes.But similarities between the two crises are deceiving, experts say. The current banking crisis is a separate, much smaller beast than in 2008.In 2008, 25 banks failed, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s database. Included in that count is Washington Mutual, the largest bank failure in US history. Over the three years that followed, nearly 400 banks failed.Three banks, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, have failed so far this year. But investors are fearful that there are more dominoes to fall.One of those dominoes could be PacWest Bancorp. Shares of the bank were down as much as 30% on Thursday after it reported customers recently withdrew 9.5% of its total deposits.Prior to 2008, there were no bank failures in 2005 or 2006 and just three in 2007. Similarly, two years before SVB collapsed in March there weren’t any bank failures.In both cases, that’s not something worthy of celebrating, said Aaron Klein, former deputy assistant secretary at the Treasury Department. “When no banks are failing, we should be concerned.”Leading up to both crises, “financial regulators were asleep at the switch — they went easy on banks and failed to require them to protect themselves,” he said.But the causes of both crises are where the similarities start to end.Banks failed in 2008 because they lent money to virtually anyone who wanted a loan, without sufficiently questioning whether they were going to pay it back on time. To complicate matters even further, banks marketed their faulty loans as safe investments and sold them off to investment banks and other kinds of financial institutions in complex packages.When the housing bubble burst, the whole global financial system become infected by the faulty loans.“The interconnectivity brought even the biggest banks to their knees,” University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy professor Dave Schabes told CNN.The latest banks to fail aren’t as intertwined with the overarching global financial system compared to the ’08 bank failures, he said. That is why “there’s no reason to think that the largest banks are facing any types of serious issues.”The three banks that failed recently didn’t properly manage interest rate risk. They all invested in long-term Treasuries, which tends to be a safe move. But as the Fed hiked interest rates, the value of these investments fell. When the banks experienced bank runs, they were forced to sell the investments at a loss, leaving them without adequate cash to back depositors’ funds.Their poor investment choices, unlike ’08, aren’t bringing down the entire banking system in part because there aren’t as many secondary markets tied up, said Schabes.The banks that failed recently did not even have issues with their underlying loans — which is a huge difference from ’08 and part of the reason Klein, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, believes the current banking crisis will be short-lived.",business,0.0

457,481,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/business/italian-pasta-price-rises/index.html,Italian pasta prices are soaring. Rome is in crisis talks with producers,2023-05-11 13:09:00,"Italy’s government convened crisis talks Thursday to investigate the reasons behind a surge in prices for pasta, one of the country’s most beloved and culturally important foods.Adolfo Urso, the country’s minister for enterprise, chaired a commission of lawmakers, pasta producers and consumer rights groups in Rome to discuss what could be done to bring down pasta prices, which soared 17.5% in March from the same month in 2022.That climb was more than double Italy’s broader measure of consumer price inflation — which stood at 8.1%, according to EU statistics. Pasta prices have soared despite the price of wheat — the main ingredient — falling in recent months.A spokesperson for Urso said in a statement Wednesday that many producers had already provided assurances that increases in pasta prices were only temporary, and had attributed the high prices “to the disposal of inventories [of pasta] made when the cost of raw materials was higher.”“In a few weeks, prices will be lowered, as production costs have considerably reduced,” the spokesperson added.This is a problem of national significance. The average Italian consumes about 23 kilograms (51 pounds) of pasta each year, Furio Truzzi, president of Assoutenti, a consumer rights group, said in a statement last month. That’s the same weight as a standard piece of checked baggage allowed on a typical flight, and works out at just over 60 grams (2 ounces) every day.“Pasta is one of the foods most loved by Italians,” Truzzi noted. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February had unleashed a “tsunami” of high prices last year for some of the raw materials needed to make pasta, he said.“Today the situation appears different,” Truzzi added, noting that some input costs have fallen.Coldiretti, Italy’s biggest farmers association, said that these higher retail prices had not translated into higher revenues for farmers of durum wheat, who were struggling to meet their own costs.The price of durum wheat — a type of wheat popular among Italian pasta-makers — has fallen 30% since May 2022. Making pasta only requires mixing water with the wheat, the group said, giving “little justification” for the huge increase in retail prices.The farmers group added that, despite the price of durum wheat being fairly uniform across Italy — at about €0.36 cents (39 cents) per kilogram — the retail price of pasta varied widely in different regions.According to an Assoutenti analysis, commissioned by the government and published in April, the average price of a one kilogram box of Barilla spaghetti, rigatoni and or penne pasta — staples in many Italians’ cupboards — rose from €1.70 ($1.86) to €2.13 ($2.33) in the year to March, an increase of more than 25%.But price rises fluctuated widely between regions, with the province of Siena in Tuscany notching an increase of more than 58%, while Alessandria, in Italy’s northwest, only saw a rise of 4.6%.Family-owned Barilla, based in Parma, is the world’s biggest pasta maker, according to Reuters. It did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.Assoutenti, along with Urso, have suggested that prices may have been inflated artificially to boost profits, with the fallout from the war in Ukraine used as a cover. They haven’t blamed specific companies.Ivana Calò, spokesperson for Unione Italiana Food, which represents food producers, told CNN that the price of pasta on shelves is greatly influenced by the price of energy, packaging and logistics. These inputs, Calò said, have all increased in price, though she did not specify over what time period.",business,0.0

The lowest level of satisfaction (42.6%) recorded in the history of the survey came in 2010 on the heels of the Great Recession.Among the 26 metrics that respondents were asked to assess in determining their satisfaction: wages and bonuses, workloads, recognition, promotion policies, job security, people at work, quality of leadership and workplace culture; their commute; and several benefits-related metrics (e.g., vacation and sick days, family leave policies, flex time plans and pension/retirement plans)“Apart from competitive pay, the factors that most influence employee retention center around work experience and culture. … Across the majority of 26 factors surveyed, employees with hybrid work arrangements report the greatest job satisfaction compared to fully remote or fully on-premises workers,” Board researchers said in their analysis.Survey respondents who had recently changed jobs also were more likely to say they were satisfied.“Overall job satisfaction is 3.6 percentage points higher among those who have found a new job since the pandemic began, compared to those who have not,” Conference Board researchers wrote.The job switchers reported their biggest boosts in satisfaction came from their new job’s training programs, bonus plan, mental health benefits and promotion policy.Just as there continues to be an overall gender pay gap at work and a shortage of women in leadership roles at many companies, the Conference Board survey revealed there is also a satisfaction gap.“Despite year-over-year improvements, job satisfaction among women remains below that of men, with large gaps appearing in job security, promotion policy and bonus plans, as well as across compensation and benefits, including pay, sick-day policy, vacation policy and health plans,” the researchers said.In addition to women’s dissatisfaction with those various compensation factors, they are also less satisfied with their workplace’s recognition, performance reviews, growth potential and communication channels.The broad takeaway from the survey for all employers, the researchers concluded, is this: “After establishing and maintaining competitive pay and benefits, leaders gain the most by offering flexible, hybrid work arrangements, and by emphasizing work experience and culture factors such as interesting work, reasonable workloads, and opportunities for career growth.”The Conference Board survey, which was conducted online, had 1,680 respondents who were nationally representative of all employed US workers.",business,0.0

A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 5.30%.“This week’s decrease continues a recent sideways trend in mortgage rates, which is a welcome departure from the record increases of last year,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.Mortgage rates topped 5% for the first time since 2011 a little more than a year ago, and have remained over 5% for all but one week during the past year. Since then they have gone as high as 7.08%, last reached in November. But over the last month rates have averaged about 6.37% and have been going up and down, but staying under 6.5%.“While inflation remains elevated, its rate of growth has moderated and is expected to decelerate over the remainder of 2023,” Khater added. “This should bode well for the trajectory of mortgage rates over the long term.”The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit.The rate for a fixed-rate 30-year loan held relatively steady at the lower end of the 6% range this week because the inflation picture is showing expected improvement.“In light of a strong jobs report last week, April’s Consumer Price Index data reinforced that we are very likely at the end of the tightening cycle,” said Jiayi Xu, an economist at Realtor.com.On Wednesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that headline CPI climbed by 4.9% in April year over year, slowing for the 10th consecutive month and hitting its lowest level in two years.“While the US economy is moving in the right direction, the pace of improvement is likely slower than desired by the Federal Reserve, and inflation still remains significantly above the target of 2%,” said Xu. “As long as the economy continues to see progress on inflation, it is expected that mortgage rates will remain toward the lower end of the 6-7% range.”While mortgage rates have stayed under 6.5% for a month, they are about one percentage point above what some economists see as a tipping point of 5.5% rates that would motivate homeowners to sell.Many homeowners bought or refinanced into ultra-low interest rates during the past few years. The idea of giving that up and buying another house at 5.5% sounds a lot better to them than buying something at 6.5%.But buyers are responding positively when rates tick down, and both refinance and purchase applications saw strong gains last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.“The decline in mortgage rates is good news for prospective homebuyers, but housing supply is still too low in many parts of the country,” said Bob Broeksmit, MBA President and CEO. “Housing construction has slowed, and some would-be sellers are delaying decisions because of economic uncertainty and an unwillingness to give up their low-rate mortgage.”In addition to the “locked-in effect” of mortgage rates, sellers are facing another issue caused by high inflation: the increasing costs of home improvements prior to selling.A recent survey from Realtor.com shows that improving homes before selling is one of the top concerns among sellers.“In April 2023, the household furnishing and supplies index increased 4.8% over the prior year, a welcomed improvement compared to the preceding two months, during which the growth in household furnishing exceeded the overall inflation rate,” said Xu.However, certain items, such as floor covering, still experienced a faster price growth of 9.9% higher than a year ago.“While this issue primarily affects sellers, buyers may also suffer the consequences, as the high cost of home repairs are likely to be passed on to them in the end.”",business,0.0

Police officials said the incident was not a “rampage.”One of the men died in hospital after being severely injured in the incident, police added. Nobody else was harmed.The victims of the shooting, both 44, and the perpetrator were employed by an external service provider, according to Mercedes Benz.Police said they were still investigating the motive for the attack, which occurred at around 7:45 am local time (1:45 am ET).The shooter “entered the factory hall and shot at two people. Security guards seized the suspect and handed him over to police, who encountered no resistance as they arrested him,” the police added in a statement.“The factory hall was evacuated and workers are currently being cared for by police and the company’s support staff.”Mercedes-Benz said in a statement that work has been suspended until the end of the week in the affected part of the factory. The rest of the plant continues to operate “on schedule,” the company added.“We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news from Sindelfingen this morning. Our thoughts are with the victims, their families and all colleagues on site,” it said.Founded in 1915, the site in Sindelfingen is the automaker’s longest-running factory and employs 35,000 people, according to the company’s website. It produces the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class.Shootings in Germany are rarer than in the United States, but Thursday’s incident comes just two months after a gunman killed six people, as well as an unborn child, at a Jehovah’s Witnesses center in Hamburg, before turning the gun on himself.Gun control laws mean firearms are largely kept out of the public eye, and those laws have been tightened in recent years following several shooting incidents.German citizens require a weapons possession card to own or buy a gun, and a weapons license to use or carry a loaded gun.A new Weapons Act was introduced in 2003 after a school shooting in Erfurt that left 16 people dead. In January 2022, one person was killed and three others injured after a man opened fire on students in a lecture hall at Heidelberg University in southwestern Germany.And in 2020, a mass shooting at two shisha bars in Hanau killed several people.",politics,0.0

In total, that depleted $15.8 billion from the FDIC’s Depositor Insurance Fund (DIF).Banks that are FDIC-insured pay fees to the fund in exchange for coverage in the event that they fail. To recover the $15.8 billion, the FDIC is proposing levying higher fees on banks that have more than $5 billion in uninsured deposits.The FDIC is focusing on these banks since they benefited the most from the FDIC’s unprecedented actions in the wake of the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank.The proposed rule would charge banks 0.125% annually for two years on all their uninsured deposits as of the end of last year after deducting $5 billion. The FDIC estimates that banks subjected to the proposed rule would take see a 17.5% reduction in income over the span of one quarter. That’s assuming that, for accounting purposes banks, record the entire two-year expense over the first quarter a payment is due.The nation’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, would pay around $1.5 billion in additional fees given the bank had around $1.2 trillion in uninsured deposits at the end of 2022, according to FDIC records. A bank that had $10 billion in uninsured deposits would pay $6.25 million a year.The FDIC estimates that 113 banks would be subject to the proposed fees. Banks with more than $50 billion in total assets would contribute 95% of fees to replenish the DIF, according to the FDIC’s estimates.The FDIC had initially estimated a bigger hit to the DIF after the bank failures, but it revised the losses downward after receiving “higher anticipated recoveries” from selling off the banks’ assets.The proposed rule won’t go into effect immediately.There will be a 60-day comment period. Following that, the FDIC expects the rule to be finalized and take effect at the beginning of next year with the first quarterly payment due on June 28, 2024.",business,0.0
462,486,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/tech/twitter-encrypted-messages-security/index.html,Twitter’s new encrypted message feature criticized by security and privacy experts,2023-05-11 10:55:00,"Privacy and security experts widely panned a new feature that Twitter unveiled Wednesday that encrypts some direct messages between users, raising questions about the future of user safety on the platform.Twitter’s early efforts at securing direct messages with encryption appear to be riddled with caveats, flaws and risks that may endanger users, the experts said after the company rolled out its initial release.With the first iteration of the feature, only users who are paying subscribers to Twitter Blue or whose organizations have paid to be verified with the company may use encrypted messages.In addition, encrypted messages may only be sent between two individuals, not groups. Encrypting images, video and other media is not supported. Both participants must either have exchanged direct messages in the past, or the recipient of an encrypted message must already follow the sender.Perhaps most crucially, Twitter acknowledged that even with the encryption feature enabled, the company itself, and other third parties, can still potentially access user messages.“I’m trying to be positive about Twitter deploying encrypted DMs even though there are so many things about this system that make it feel like a v0.1 release, or are just obnoxious,” said Matthew Green, a cryptographer and computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University, in a tweet.Twitter’s former chief information security officer, Lea Kissner, publicly pleaded with Twitter’s current engineering team to improve the feature quickly.“Twitter folks, seriously. I left some design docs somewhere. Please use them,” Kissner said on Bluesky, a rival platform.Twitter has described encrypted messaging as key to the company’s future of becoming “the most trusted platform on the internet.” But the rollout provides another example of how, under CEO Elon Musk, Twitter has forged ahead with significant changes to the platform over the warnings of independent researchers about potential unintended consequences stemming from incomplete or poorly implemented updates.In a blog post Wednesday, Twitter said users of its latest app will be eligible to participate in encrypted direct messages. And it announced that its goal is to provide a similar level of protection as other privacy-preserving apps that come highly recommended by security experts, such as Signal.“The standard should be, if someone puts a gun to our heads, we still can’t access your messages,” the blog post said. “We’re not quite there yet, but we’re working on it.”But the company also acknowledged the feature’s limitations, including the fact that the new encryption option does “not offer protections against man-in-the-middle attacks.”“As a result, if someone — for example, a malicious insider, or Twitter itself as a result of a compulsory legal process — were to compromise an encrypted conversation, neither the sender or receiver would know,” Twitter’s blog post said.The lack of so-called end-to-end encryption makes Twitter’s implementation largely meaningless, security experts said.“The ENTIRE PURPOSE of End-to-end encryption is to protect you against whoever controls the messaging servers,” said Marcus Hutchins, also known as MalwareTech, on Bluesky.John Scott-Railton, a cybersecurity and disinformation researcher, tweeted that this caveat means it is “not safe for anyone worried about privacy & safety to assume that this has equivalent protections to things like [Signal].”Twitter’s new feature also encrypts messages at the conversation level, not each individual message. That means that if a malicious actor gained unauthorized access to the keys, they could view the entire message chain. A stronger approach would be to assign each message its own encryption key, a feature that already exists in other apps.Jonathan Mayer, a computer scientist at Princeton University and a former chief technologist of the Federal Communications Commission, said Twitter’s version of encryption would fail basic principles taught in an Information Security 101 course.“We literally teach the students not to do exactly what Twitter is doing,” Mayer said.One of the feature’s biggest dangers to users is that they could come away with a false sense of security, Hutchins added, which would be far worse than Twitter offering no encryption at all, because users may be lulled into sharing more in Twitter messages than they otherwise would.In an apparent response to the wave of criticism, Musk tweeted early Thursday: “Try it, but don’t trust it yet.”",business,0.0
463,487,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/economy/april-producer-price-index/index.html,Another key inflation gauge cooled further in April,2023-05-11 10:34:00,"Wholesale annual inflation slowed in April, adding to signs that price pressures are easing.The Producer Price Index, a key measure of price changes at the wholesale level, slowed to 2.3% for the 12 months ended in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.That was below the annual increase of 2.7% in March and economists’ expectations of a 2.4% increase. It’s also the slowest annual increase since 2021. The year-over-year decline was driven by falling prices for eggs, grains, chickens, diesel and liquified petroleum gas.On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.2%. During the previous month, they fell by 0.4%. The monthly gain was largely attributed to higher prices in the services sector.Gasoline prices increased 8.4% in April from the prior month. Oil production cuts announced by OPEC+ in April likely pushed up energy prices that month as crude oil prices rose.But weaker consumer demand and better supply chain conditions remain the main driving forces behind cooling supplier prices.The core index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2% in April from the prior month, and 3.2% from a year earlier.“The inflation pipeline is clearing as supply chains for the most part have returned to normal and commodity prices have eased significantly in response to slowing global conditions. Investors should expect to see further easing in prices throughout the balance of 2023,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote in an analyst note.It is possible for higher energy costs to spur price increases in other goods and services that utilize energy, such as freight, if they remain elevated for long enough, said Stephen Juneau, an economist at Bank of America. He added that the price increases tied to the OPEC production cuts have already reversed this month.The Federal Reserve began to aggressively raise interest rates last year to slow demand and tamp down inflation and it has seen some progress since then.The Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes across a basket of consumer goods, rose 4.9% in April, down from the 5% rise in March, the BLS reported Wednesday. That was the 10th consecutive month of slowing consumer inflation and the lowest reading since April 2021. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was unchanged at 5.5% for the 12 months ended in April.PPI is also a closely watched inflation gauge: Since the producer-centric index captures price shifts upstream of the consumer, it’s sometimes looked to as a potential leading indicator of how prices may eventually land at the store level — though that could take several months, Juneau said.While consumer inflation remains well above the Fed’s 2% target, there are some indicators pointing to a slowdown in demand — which could ease some inflationary pressure. US household spending was flat in March from the prior month, after advancing 0.1% in February.“The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week in a news conference after the central bank raised its benchmark lending rate by a quarter point.Tighter credit conditions after recent bank failures could also curb demand and slow the economy. A survey of senior loan officers gauging lending activity in the first quarter released on Monday showed that banks began toughening their lending standards even before the banking turbulence in March.Recent bank stresses can make accessing credit even harder and could even equate to a percent-and-a-half rate hike, according to an estimate from Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.Fed officials signaled in their post-meeting statement last week that a pause in rate hikes is a possibility, and data pointing to inflation broadly easing could keep them on that path in June.",business,0.0

Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, asked Shaw four different times to commit to compensating homeowners, only to hear Shaw repeatedly reply, “Senator, I’m committed to do what’s right.”His responses angered Markey and some other senators.“Will you commit to insuring that these families, these innocent families do not lose their life savings in their homes and small businesses?” Markey asked Shaw at that hearing. “The right thing to do is to say, ‘Yes we will.’”When Shaw came back to a follow-up hearing on March 23, he unveiled plans for a compensation plan.“We also know residents are worried about their home values,” he said at that later hearing. “We understand these concerns. We are committed to working with all relevant stakeholders to provide tailored protection for home sellers if their property loses value due to the impact of the derailment.”The latest letter to the committee provided more details of those compensation plan. While it talks about a five-mile radius, it said it will develop the details of the geographic area for homeowners eligible to receive compensation “in concert with the key stakeholders involved with the legal process, in order to ensure we are following appropriate procedures and are respecting the class action participants’ rights.”The company faced not just grilling from the senators, ut it is also the subject of some lawsuits from homeowners seeking compensation for lost property values.The compensation promise was good news to Melissa Henry, who lived about a mile from the derailment site, and recently sold her remodeled home at a loss.“I am surprised, and I hope they keep their word,” she told CNN Thursday. “They should.  A lot of people want out and can’t, so I think this will help people who want to sell.”She said she would have preferred for the company to notify residents of the plans, rather than the Senate committee.“You would think they would reach out to us,” she said. “We can’t get a straight answer half the time from those people, so that doesn’t surprise me.”The company’s website said Thursday that so far it has pledged $34.4 million to East Palestine and the surrounding area. In its letter to the senators the company says the financial commitment “is just a downpayment,” with an aim to provide for the community “not just for the near term, but for the long haul.”Shaw defended the company’s commitment to the community at the company’s annual shareholder meeting Thursday, saying it remains committed to making things right for East Palestine. He said he has visited the town nearly weekly since the derailment and has heard from residents about what they want and need.The company has ample resources with which to compensate shareholders. With a population of about 5,000 people, there are roughly 2,600 residential properties in East Palestine according to Attom, a property data provider. The average value of a property there in January of this year, prior to the derailment, was $146,000, according to Attom.Taken together, the value of all residential real estate in the town adds up to about $380 million, including single family homes and multi-family properties.Norfolk Southern estimates the derailment cost the company $387 million, including site cleanup and various compensation programs. It said that some of that cost may be recoverable from insurers. And even with the charge it took from the accident, it earned net income of $466 million in just the first three months of the year.The letter comes as the committee recently voted to approve the Railway Safety Act of 2023, co-sponsored by Ohio’s two senators, Democrat Sherrold Brown and Republican JD Vance. While Shaw has said there are parts of the bill that Norfolk Southern can support, it and other railroads are opposed to some of the new regulations, such as a requirement that all locomotives have at least a two-person crew, that are included in the current version of the bill.– CNN’s Anna Bahney contributed to this report",business,0.0
465,489,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/business/proposed-salary-history-ban-federal-government/index.html,White House wants to ban use of salary history in setting pay for new federal hires,2023-05-11 09:55:00,"Whether one’s paycheck can keep pace with inflation is always a concern. But for women, the question is also can their pay keep pace with their male peers?On Wednesday, the White House Office of Personnel Management proposed regulations to prohibit managers at federal agencies from considering a new hire’s salary history when setting their pay for a position.While many factors create a gender pay gap, one that can perpetuate it is the use of salary history to establish a new hire’s pay, rather than making an offer strictly based on the competencies the person brings to the role.Women — particularly minority women — who may have been regularly underpaid in the private sector relative to men can never escape that disadvantage if their salary history follows them to every new job.The gender pay gap in the federal government is far lower than that of the private sector, according to OPM. That’s largely thanks to published rates of pay for every role’s grade-level. But managers at federal agencies have discretion to pay more than the published rates in select circumstances, primarily when there is a dire need to fill a role or to find someone with highly specialized skills. In fiscal year 2021, 9.5% of new hires had their pay set under the discretionary authority federal agency managers have.“These proposed regulations are a historic step forward that will help make the federal government a national leader in pay equity,” said OPM Director Kiran Ahuja. “Relying on a candidate’s previous salary history can disproportionally hurt women and minorities. With these proposed regulations, the federal government is leading the way and demonstrating to the nation that we mean business when it comes to equality, fairness, and attracting the best talent.”To date, only 21 states either prohibit or otherwise limit the extent to which employers may take job applicants’ salary history into consideration.In addition, some states and cities now require employers to publish the salary range on offer for roles they want to fill. It is still early days under such requirements, but the hope is that they will help reduce pay gaps and level the playing field for job candidates and existing employees.",politics,0.0

GM Envolve will work closely with large business and government fleet customers to tie them more closely to GM’s other businesses.Last year, Ford announced the creation of Ford Pro which, along with Ford Model E for electric passenger vehicles and Ford Blue for combustion-powered passenger vehicles, would report its financial results as a distinct business unit.Ford Pro doesn’t just sell trucks and vans to to fleet customers, but also offers things like software for fleet management and maintenance, charging systems for electric vehicles, and it even works with so-called “upfitters,” outside companies that customize trucks and vans for specific jobs.GM Envolve – the name is a mash-up of “energy” and “evolve” –  will work in a similar fashion with fleet customers. Each large fleet customer will have an assigned GM Envolve account executive. The account exec work with the customer and with GM’s other various business units including, of course, Chevrolet and GMC but also OnStar Business Solutions, GM Energy, and BrightDrop, GM’s electric delivery van subsidiary.Both GM Energy – which could supply customers with energy storage and stationary hydrogen power units – and Brightdrop are other new business units GM has spawned in the past few years.“The big thing that customers told us in the research is ‘We want a one stop shop, we want to be able to go to you to get everything that we need to get the business done,’” said Ed Peper, U.S. vice president of GM Envolve. “The second thing would be the single sales touch point, which we think simplifies the experience for the customer.”In the last few years, GM has gotten 300 new major fleet customers – companies with over 300 vehicles – to switch to GM from competitive automakers, said Peper. He did not specify which automakers these customers were “conquested” from, as taking customers from competitors is called in the industry.“It’s important that we work with our existing customers to provide even more solutions for them,” Peper said. “At the same time, we’re conquesting at a pretty healthy rate.”Ford and GM sell a similar number of vehicles to commercial fleets, according to estimates from Cox Automotive. Ford sold about 280,000 vehicles to corporate fleets in 2022 while GM sold almost 300,000. GM’s figures include more rental vehicles than Ford’s, though, said Cox Automotive spokesman Mark Schirmer. And Ford sells more than twice as many vehicles as GM to government fleets, according to Cox estimates.Of course, the point of Ford Pro and GM Envolve isn’t just to sell more cars and trucks. The goal is also form relationships that enable the sale of other products and services, as well, such as vehicle charging software and energy equipment from GM Energy and auto and truck parts from GM and AC Delco for GM. Ford, likewise, offers software, data, and other services along with its trucks, vans and SUVs.Even existing fleet customers can have specific needs for which various GM subsidiaries offer products the customers were just unaware of, said Steve Hill, vice president of GM’s commercial growth strategies and operations. That way, playing off existing fleet relationships, this new business unit is hoped to help bring in more revenue for GM overall.Ford Pro, Ford’s commercial and government vehicle and operations arm earned $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023, the first time the new business divisions reported their finances separately. Unlike Ford Pro, GM Envolve is not expected to break out its earnings.",business,0.0
467,491,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/homes/debt-default-forecast-housing/index.html,Home buying costs could spike by 22% if US defaults on its debt,2023-05-11 08:54:00,"The United States has never defaulted on its debt, and it remains an unlikely outcome of the current standoff about raising the debt ceiling. But, if it were to happen — which could be as soon as June 1 without intervention — it would further crush an already wounded housing market, according to an analysis by Zillow.Housing costs would spike by 22% with the rate for 30-year, fixed rate mortgages rising above 8%. There would be 700,000 fewer homes sold in the 18 months after July — that’s almost 12% of the 6 million sales currently expected during that span.In other words, if you thought this past year of skyrocketing mortgage rates and plunging sales was miserable for the housing market, just wait, there’s more. If the United States defaults on its debts, we can do the past 12 months all over again.“While we don’t expect a debt default to occur, if it did, it would have unprecedented effects on the financial system,” said Jeff Tucker, a senior economist at Zillow. “This would reduce lending and credit availability throughout the financial system. What that means for the housing market is that the cost of borrowing would rise dramatically and sales would be dropping.”In Zillow’s analysis, interest rates would spike, peaking at 8.4%; and unemployment would surge, peaking at 8.3% from its current rate of 3.4%. This analysis projects what might happen in the event of a prolonged default, and it is not a prediction that a default will occur.“This would be a scenario of a recession being triggered by a huge contraction in federal outlays,” said Tucker. “Home buyers and sellers finally have been adjusting to mortgage rates over 6% this spring, but a debt default could potentially raise borrowing costs even higher and send the market into a deep freeze.”Zillow projects the combined impact of buyers and sellers pulling back would wipe out nearly one-quarter of expected sales in some months. If there were to be a debt default, the biggest projected deficit would come in September, with an estimated 23% fewer existing home sales.The severity of the impact depends a lot on the duration of the drama, Tucker added.“If the crisis grinds on for longer, all these impacts would last longer and be more severe,” he said. “If it turns out to be a more short-term problem, there would be shocks but I could see the situation where it could come back relatively quickly.”In the event of the debt ceiling not being addressed, mortgage rates would likely climb quickly as investors become worried about almost every type of bond.Government issued Treasury bonds have been considered a risk-free, safe-haven for investors. If they suddenly carry risk, Tucker said, “it is an earthquake on which everything else is built.”Uncertainty in Treasuries being repaid will lead investors to require greater return for purchasing them. Mortgage rates tend to follow yields on 10 year Treasury bonds and would likely rise, too.“Treasury bonds are used as collateral to back all kinds of loans,” said Tucker. “If you have to second guess the value of collateral, everyone across the board is less willing to lend and only willing for a higher return. It is a picture of contagion and a credit crisis spreading. Everyone is suddenly questioning all kinds of lending.”With about three weeks till the point at which the government can no longer pay its bills — known as the ‘X-date — the point is approaching when that risk will begin to be priced into lending, if the crisis is not resolved.“Right now, it’s contained to short-term securities, like one month Treasuries, which have been breaking records,” said Tucker. “It is a looming risk about a month away, so it isn’t yet wreaking havoc on 30-year mortgage rates. But we’re continuing to inch forward into unprecedented territory.”Even though this is an “unlikely, worst-case scenario of a prolonged default,” as Zillow economists call it, they say homeowner value would hold relatively strong. A small silver lining to this possible catastrophe.The Zillow analysis projects that if the United States were to default on its debt, home values would begin to fall starting in August, but only by 1% from current levels through February 2024. Even in this dire scenario, home values would still be expected to rise 1% from today to the end of next year. That’s down from a current expectation of 6.5% growth over that period.Home values tend to fall sharply when the market is flooded with listings. But in this scenario, inventory would shrink below its already historically low levels. Low inventory would keep prices from falling too far, too fast.",business,0.0

During the ’90s, MTV News also provided an alternative to traditional cable news that appealed to young Americans.The cuts, described by McCarthy as a “strategic realignment,” aim to streamline units and reduce overall costs, allowing the company to be more effective as it moves forward.In addition to MTV News, some units in the company are being eliminated altogether, most of which are operations, a Paramount spokesperson said.Nearly every major news, entertainment and technology company has been forced to slash its workforce in recent months as they face a slumping advertising market and other industry challenges.CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, Gannett, Vox Media, NBC News and others have also cut their workforces in recent months.",business,0.0

Both locations will close in the summer with the upscale chain department store explaining in a memo to employees that it’s letting the stores’ leases expire.“Decisions like this are never easy, and this one has been especially difficult,” wrote Jamie Nordstrom, Nordstrom’s chief stores officer, in a memo obtained by CNN. “But as many of you know, the dynamics of the downtown San Francisco market have changed dramatically over the past several years, impacting customer foot traffic to our stores and our ability to operate successfully.”A mall spokesperson told CNN affiliate KGO-TV that Nordstrom’s closure “underscores the deteriorating situation in downtown San Francisco.”“A growing number of retailers and businesses are leaving the area due to the unsafe conditions for customers, retailers, and employees, coupled with the fact that these significant issues are preventing an economic recovery of the area,” the mall said.Nordstrom’s exit dealt another blow for San Francisco, as several well-known chains have closed in the city. A few weeks ago, a Whole Foods location that opened just a year ago announced it was temporarily closing because of worker safety. San Francisco Standard, an independent news website, has tracked 20 closures of major stores since 2020, including Anthropologie, Office Depot and CB2.Incidents of theft in San Francisco have gained national attention, though crime has generally fallen over the past six years.Property crimes in San Francisco have garnered national attention because of several attention-grabbing videos of thieves in action. Though still well below 2017 levels, the city saw a 23% increase in property crimes between 2020 and 2022, with spikes in burglary and theft headlining the surge, according to San Francisco Police Department data.Meanwhile, violent crime statistics in San Francisco have remained relatively steady in recent years. Preliminary police data reports 12 homicides in San Francisco this year, an uptick of 20% compared to the same period in the previous year. In total, there were 56 homicides in San Francisco in 2022, which is the same number of homicides the city saw in 2021.There are several other reasons that may have contributed to the Nordstrom locations’ closures besides crime. For starters, remote work following the pandemic has caused a decrease in foot traffic in major US downtowns, including San Francisco. Malls have also been fading in popularity with shoppers as they shift their allegiance online.Nordstrom",business,0.0

Customers have until May 13 to use their gift cards, and locations will start closing in the coming weeks.It’s a somber ending for the 49-year-old retailer after it filed for its second bankruptcy in three years. Tuesday Morning said in February 2023 that it was restructuring because of its “exceedingly burdensome debt.” Its first bankruptcy happened in May 2020, during the peak of the pandemic because of prolonged store closures that caused an “insurmountable financial hurdle.”Tuesday Morning currently has 200 locations in 25 states — a sharp decline from the 700 it had around three years ago. Notably, it doesn’t sell products online.Consumer spending has slowed down in the face of inflation, and interest rates have increased, making it costlier for companies to borrow.

It’s never been a problem",2023-05-10 10:13:00,"The United States isn’t the only country that puts a limit on how much money its government is allowed to borrow. But it is the only nation regularly pushed to the brink of a political and economic crisis as a result.President Joe Biden will host Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday for a critical meeting on raising the US debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that if a deal isn’t reached soon, the United States could run out of cash to pay its bills as early as June 1.That could mean the United States defaults on its debt, which economists have said would unleash a financial meltdown and a recession.Stakes that high raise a question: Do other countries have this problem?The answer is no. Few countries set formal limits on public borrowing needed to meet legal obligations, precisely because they can become tools of political brinkmanship, according to Mrugank Bhusari, an assistant director at the Atlantic Council, a think tank.The only other advanced economy that limits borrowing in absolute terms is Denmark. But in the Scandinavian country, the ceiling is intentionally set high enough to avoid political dramas like the one playing out in Washington.“It’s really rare for debt limits to pose genuine threats to economic stability in a country,” Bhusari said.Congress first imposed a limit of $45 billion on overall US government borrowing in 1939. That was about 10% above total federal debt at the time.Since then, the country’s economy has expanded substantially — as has its borrowing. US federal debt increased to $30.9 trillion in 2022 (from $870 billion in 1939, in current dollars). The ratio of general government debt to gross domestic product, or GDP, stood at about 128% in 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund.That’s meant Congress has had to frequently step in. Since 1960, legislators have acted 78 times — on average more than once a year — to raise or modify the US debt limit so the government can continue to pay its bills.It’s a problem unique to the United States. Countries that have opted for debt limits, with the goal of encouraging fiscal restraint, tend to structure them as a percentage of GDP instead of choosing a nominal value, according to Bhusari. They also tend to be non-binding.Malaysia, Namibia and Pakistan are all in this camp, he said. The European Union asks member states to limit debt to 60% of GDP, though many consistently break that rule and it was suspended during the pandemic. It may yet be revised to spur spending on the green and digital transitions.The closest analogue to the US debt ceiling is the set-up in Denmark. Yet lawmakers in Copenhagen don’t find themselves locked in perennial political confrontations.When Denmark implemented a debt ceiling in 1993 — a constitutional necessity following a structural overhaul of its government — it was determined that the upper limit for borrowing should be 950 billion Danish kroner ($140 billion), significantly above government debt levels at the time.Las Olsen, chief economist at Denmark’s Danske Bank, said this was a strategic decision. Lawmakers did not want the debt ceiling to become a proxy for difficult conversations about the government’s fiscal plans.“The logic is Parliament sets tax and spending, and once it does that, there’s no way around allowing the government to borrow the difference,” Olsen said.Political leaders were also cognizant that as a small country, Denmark couldn’t afford to spook investors with regular political stand-offs.The debt limit in Denmark has been increased only once. It was roughly doubled in 2010 to deal with the economic aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. But the increase was ultimately unnecessary; borrowing stayed well below the cap.“It’s not a political issue at all,” Olsen said. “It’s seen as a complete formality.”There are limitations to comparing the United States and Denmark. The latter borrows far less compared with the size of its economy, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 37% in 2021. It often runs budget surpluses.That makes Denmark less likely to run into problems with the ceiling — regardless of the level at which it’s set.“The country is so much more fiscally conservative in many ways than the United States,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, based in Washington, D.C. “It has far, far, far lower levels of debt.”There are also major political differences. While the United States has a clearer separation of powers, often leading to gridlock between the executive and legislative branches, Denmark’s parliament elects the head of government, often on the basis of a coalition of parties. That makes it less likely the debt ceiling could be turned into a political football. There are also distinct processes for creating annual budgets.Even so, it’s clear that in Denmark, the debt limit has enabled the smooth functioning of government, Kirkegaard said. In the United States, it’s had the opposite effect.“We have to spend an awful lot of time on this at regular intervals,” Kirkegaard said. “All we’re doing is avoiding a disaster scenario we’re creating for ourselves.”Bhusari of the Atlantic Council also described the US debt ceiling crisis as “entirely self-imposed.”When it comes to tackling issues like debt sustainability, he said, investors “often think of [a ceiling] as more of a problem than a solution,” even if they prize fiscal caution. Most likely, the limit will just keep being raised.He noted the example of Australia, which introduced a debt ceiling in 2008 to bolster its fiscal credentials, raised it multiple times, and ultimately ditched it in 2013 when it became a constant source of political friction.The United States may be singular in its approach to debt management. But should the country default, it will become the world’s problem — at a time when high interest rates and inflation are already causing pain.“No one fully knows what will happen and it poses a lot of uncertainty,” Bhusari said.Financial markets are built on an understanding that owning US debt, or Treasuries, is safe. If the United States is unable to pay its creditors for an extended period, White House economists have predicted the value of the stock market could crater, and the country could suffer a deep recession, with the loss of more than 8 million jobs.",business,0.0

The first coronation in 70 years attracted only 360,000 American viewers in the 18-34 age group, with a further 1.6 million in the 35-54 demographic. The vast majority — just over 8 million — were 55 or older.Across the pond, the British TV audience for Saturday’s spectacle peaked at 20.4 million just after midday (7a.m. ET) when the King received his crown, according to data provided by the UK Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (Barb). The company did not provide a breakdown of audience by age group.But the overall peak viewing figure in the United Kingdom was 9 million down on the number recorded for the Queen’s funeral, according to media reports. The BBC audience for the coronation was down about 5 million from the 20 million that tuned into BBC One — the UK public broadcaster’s main channel — for that service last September.In 1953, more than 20 million people watched the late Queen being crowned, according to estimates based on surveys by the BBC at the time.

The PCAOB scrutinized four audits from each firm for fiscal years generally ending in 2021.“We identified problems, so now we can begin the work of holding firms accountable to fix them,” Williams said. It is “not unexpected to find such high rates of deficiencies in jurisdictions that are being inspected for the first time.”In a statement, KPMG Huazhen said it “acknowledges the findings of the PCAOB following its inspection and has taken steps to address the issues identified.”“Audit quality is fundamental to our business and we continue to invest heavily in innovation, technology, people and training to create a stronger, more resilient audit business,” the firm added.PwC Hong Kong called the PCAOB inspection “an important milestone in cooperation between China and US regulators and for US capital markets.”“Although a number of issues are raised by the PCAOB, the report also states that with respect to the audits inspected, none were found to have an incorrect opinion on financial statements,” it continued.The results of the inspections come nine months after China agreed to allow US officials to examine the audit papers of accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, ending a long stand-off.US regulators had long lobbied for this access, worried that Chinese firms listed on Wall Street were misrepresenting their financial heath. Beijing had pushed back, citing national security concerns.The breakthrough meant that more than 160 Chinese companies avoided being kicked out of the world’s biggest stock market, as US regulators threatened if they weren’t able to inspect their audits.",business,0.0

Shipments of iron ore lump and iron ore fines to China also jumped 28% and 22.5%, respectively, to $380 million and $973 million.The increased trade comes as relations between Beijing and Canberra have eased following more than two years of a deep freeze.In early 2020, then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19 – first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan – which threatened to challenge Beijing’s narrative of the outbreak.The Chinese government said Morrison’s request was “political manipulation,” and since then imposed a series of trade restrictions on Australian products, including barley, lobsters and coal.But the frosty relationship has shown signs of thawing since last year when the Labor party swept to power in Australia. Earlier this year, Beijing removed all remaining curbs on Australian coal imports, ending an unofficial ban.China is Australia’s largest trading partner, accounting for nearly one third of its overseas trade, according to the Australian government.Australia is among China’s largest supplier of commodities. It accounted for more than one fifth of China’s thermal coal imports before the trade restrictions were imposed.For iron ore, it remained the largest supplier for China even when relations soured. In 2022, China bought 1.1 billion tonnes of iron ore, 65% of which were from Australia.For Beijing, commodities from Australia are important for its efforts to revive the pandemic-hit economy.

He starts the new job on June 2.The election came after World Bank board members interviewed Banga for four hours on Monday. Malpass’s last day at the bank will be June 1. The decision came in a vote by 24 of the board’s members, with Russia abstaining, instead of the usual consensus-based process, a source familiar with the process said.Biden congratulated Banga on his “resounding approval” to run the World Bank, which he described as “one of humanity’s most critical institutions to reduce poverty and expand prosperity around the globe.”“Ajay Banga will be a transformative leader, bringing expertise, experience, and innovation to the position of World Bank President,” Biden said. “He will help steer the institution as it evolves and expands to address global challenges that directly affect its core mission of poverty reduction — including climate change.”Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Banga brought the “right leadership and management skills” to the job, and would play a critical role in pushing forward with additional reforms, including by forging partnerships between the public and private sectors and nonprofit groups.“Ajay understands that the challenges we face – from combatting climate change, pandemics, and fragility to eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity – are deeply intertwined. He has effectively built a broad global coalition around his vision for the Bank over the course of his candidacy,” Yellen said in a statement.Katie Malouf-Bous, interim head of Oxfam International’s Washington office, said the bank needed “serious reform” to tackle the widening gap between rich and poor, but that would require huge new public investments and “guardrails around private finance that has run riot for too long.”One senior US official said Banga’s election came at a critical moment marked by emerging debt distress in lower- and middle-income countries and ongoing problems in food and energy markets as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine.“It is a challenging moment, but it’s a moment where the World Bank remains more vital than ever, and where getting the evolution of the World Bank is absolutely critical,” the official said.The bank already loans out hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries but is working to increase its lending to help them address overlapping global challenges such as climate change, conflict and brace for future pandemics.“The Board looks forward to working with Mr. Banga on the World Bank Group Evolution process … on all the World Bank Group’s ambitions and efforts aimed at tackling the toughest development challenges facing developing countries,” the bank said.The World Bank has been led by an American since its founding at the end of World War Two, while the International Monetary Fund has been led by a European.Banga, who was born in India and spent his early career there, has been a US citizen since 2007.Banga has met with officials from 96 governments since his nomination, the source said.

As Western leaders look to boost economic cooperation with countries that share similar values, India, the world’s largest democracy, stands to gain.Until recently, many countries and companies “had put all their eggs in the China basket,” said Partha Sen, professor emeritus at the Delhi School of Economics. As tensions continue to flare between the West and Beijing, there is “a move to diversify away, and India fits right into it,” he added.India’s so-called “demographic dividend,” the potential economic growth arising from a large working-age population, represents a major opportunity. Its vast consumer market and pool of affordable labor is also drawing more attention from global brands and trading partners.In a bid to boost the industrial sector and lift exports, the Indian government has sought to sign free trade deals, a move that’s been warmly received around the world.Since 2021, India has struck agreements with Australia, the United Arab Emirates and Mauritius. It is also negotiating deals with the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada.Russia, whose trade with the West has slumped since its invasion of Ukraine last year, is also interested in increasing ties with India. The move is seen as risky, as it requires a tricky balancing act for New Delhi of keeping Washington happy while warming up to Moscow, according to Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist for Capital Economics.The United States and India have taken steps in recent months to strengthen their ties, particularly in defense and technology, as they attempt to counter the rise of an increasingly assertive China.In January, the White House launched a partnership with India that Washington hoped would help the countries compete against China on artificial intelligence, military equipment and semiconductors.The United States touted the deal as reinforcing “our democratic values and democratic institutions,” even as those ideals have been undermined by India’s recent crackdown on opposition politicians and the media.In February, Air India bought more than 200 aircraft from Boeing",world,0.0

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.11% in the early afternoon while China’s blue chip CSI300 Index was 0.26% weaker, after climbing 0.5% before the lunch break.The downturn in imports suggests the world economy won’t be able to count much on China’s domestic engine of growth, and as the nation re-exports some of its imports, it also reinforces the extent of weakness in some of its major trading partner economies.A 15.3% drop in the import of semiconductors indicate the scale of the demand-pullback in the re-export market for such parts.Analysts say the sharp global monetary policy tightening campaign of the past 12-18 months and recent Western banking stress remain concerns for revival prospects of both China and worldwide.Shipments growth to ASEAN, a block of Southeast Asian countries, slowed to 4.5% in April from 35.4% last month. The region is China’s largest export partner.Other recent data also showed South Korean exports to China, a leading indicator of China’s imports, were down 26.5% in April, continuing 10 consecutive months of decline.China’s coal imports fell in April from a 15-month high in the prior month, snapping back as demand weakens in Asian giant. Imports of copper, a proxy for global growth, and natural gas were also down in the same period.The recent official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for April showed new export orders contracting sharply, underlining the challenge facing Chinese policymakers and businesses hoping for a robust post-Covid economic recovery.China’s first quarter GDP data last month, while offering some relief, also raised doubts about the demand outlook due to property market weakness, slowing prices and surging bank savings.The government, which has stepped up a range of policy support measures, is aiming for a modest GDP growth target of around 5% for this year, after badly missing the 2022 goal.“The global economy is deteriorating and will weaken China’s manufacturing sector,” said Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING.“It is looking more likely that, in response, the government will step in to support the manufacturing sector’s labor market through fiscal stimulus.”",business,0.0

No matter how much you earn or how much you owe, adopting a few good money habits now puts you in good stead not only in your 20s but for the rest of your life.“It will take a lot of stress off future decisions,” said Shari Greco Reiches, a behavioral finance expert, financial adviser and author of “Maximize Your Return on Life.”Here are just a few smart money moves that can help you get started.Ideally, you should spend less than you make and save the rest.Doing so gives you more freedom to invest your energy in what’s most important to you — such as where and how you live, work and travel.But living within your means involves making choices based on your priorities (not those of your friends who may be living larger than you can afford).“You can have anything you want, but not everything. So pick what’s most important,” Reiches said.Figure out how much money you bring in, how much you spend and how much you save. Know, too, what you spend on things that you like but don’t actually need. That way you’ll know where you can trim spending if necessary.As a guideline, Reiches suggests the 50/20/30 rule. Take your gross income and subtract from it all federal, state and local income taxes plus Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from your pay. (If you’re doing this on the basis of one paycheck, and you’re paid every two weeks, multiply this result by 26 to get an annual after-tax figure because you will receive 26 paychecks in a year.)From that after-tax income, allocate no more than 50% to essential expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, etc.). Another 20% goes to saving for short- and long-term goals and to paying down high-interest debt. And the remaining 30% can go to discretionary spending (clothing, entertainment, eating out, travel, gifts, etc.).The 50/20/30 rule isn’t fixed. If you live in a high-cost area, for instance, your rent could push you over the 50% mark for essentials. In that case, you can choose where to cut back in other areas or reduce your housing costs by living with roommates, for example.Your employee benefits at work can help defray some costs too — such as subsidized gym memberships or free, on-site medical services, subsidized transportation costs and other discounts.You’ve heard you’ll be paid a bonus. You’re expecting a raise. Someone in your family may send you birthday money. And a friend still has to pay you back for last year’s vacation. All of that money may materialize. But until it does, don’t spend it in advance because you have no control over when it will come or how much you’ll get.If you’re young, healthy and financially stretched, it’s tempting to forgo health insurance because you figure your chances of getting seriously ill are low. True, but they’re not zero. And your youth and good looks will not protect you from getting (expensively) injured in a bike or car accident.Since a health crisis can easily cost you $50,000 or more if you’re uninsured, having health insurance can protect you from an unhealthy debt load for years to come.“It is the No. 1 safety net you need,” said Jonathan Clements, founder of the site HumbleDollar, and editor of the new book “My Money Journey: How 30 People Found Financial Freedom — and You Can Too.”If you’re under 26 and can remain on a parent’s employer-subsidized health plan, that will save you money.If you’re not on a parent’s plan and are a freelancer or contractor, get catastrophic coverage or a bronze-level plan on the health insurance marketplace. (If your income is low enough, you may even qualify for a tax credit to offset the cost.) If you make $40,000, for example, the average bronze plan premium is $103 a month for a non-smoker, according to this calculator from KFF.If you work full-time for one employer, pick an affordable option from the subsidized plans on offer.Tracking all your purchases and other expenses gets hairy when you use multiple payment methods (bank debit cards, credit cards, payment apps, etc.)If possible, streamline what you use to make payments.Clements recommends having just two credit cards: One with a low credit limit (e.g., $1,000 to $2,000) that you use as your “walking around” card for purchases. The second, with a higher limit (e.g., $5,000), should be kept at home and used only for emergencies and when you travel.That way you limit how much you charge (thereby making it easier to pay your monthly bills so you don’t get hit with late fees and punitive interest rates). Plus it helps your credit score because you will never charge too high a percentage of your total credit limit. (Clements notes that for the higher limit card to continue counting toward your total credit limit, you should use it occasionally for a small purchase so that some activity on that card is reported to the credit bureaus. Paying off more than one line of credit in full and on time every month also helps establish your creditworthiness.)If you use payment apps, pick one to use, not several.

484,508,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/tech/ai-search-google-io/index.html,The most popular search engine in the world is about to look different,2023-05-10 21:52:00,"Google is moving forward with plans to bring AI chat features to its core search engine as it works to keep pace with a wave of new artificial intelligence tools that could threaten the company’s dominance online for the first time in decades.The company on Wednesday said it is introducing the next evolution of Google Search, which will use an AI-powered chatbot to answer questions “you never thought Search could answer” and to help get users the information they want quicker than ever.With the update, the look and feel of Google Search results will be noticeably different. When users type a query into the main search bar, they will automatically see a pop-up with an AI-generated response in addition to displaying traditional results.Users can now sign up for a waitlist for the new Google Search, which will first launch in the United States, via the Google app or Chrome’s desktop browser. A limited amount of users will have access to it in the coming weeks, according to the company.The updates were unveiled at I/O, the company’s annual developer event, which focused on a mix of AI and hardware products. At the event, Google also announced PaLM 2, its latest AI language model to rival ChatGPT-creator OpenAI’s GPT-4. The move marks a big step forward for the technology that powers the company’s AI products and promises to be better at logic, common sense reasoning and mathematics. It can also generate specialized code in different programming languages.The moves come as Google’s rivals, including Microsoft, are racing to develop and deploy AI features in search engines and productivity tools in the wake of the viral success of ChatGPT. The immense attention on ChatGPT reportedly prompted Google’s management to declare a “code red” situation for its search business.In addition to the changes to search, Google is expanding access to its existing chatbot Bard, which operates outside the search engine and can help users do tasks such as outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge. The tool, which was previously available to early users via a waitlist only in the US, will soon be available for all users in 120 countries and 40 languages.Google is also launching extensions for Bard from its own services, such as Gmail, Sheets and Docs, allowing users to ask questions and collaborate with the chatbot within the apps they’re using.But incorporating AI chatbots comes with some risks. These tools have sparked concerns about tone and accuracy, the latter of which is of particular important for the online search engine that has long been the cornerstone of Google’s business.In CNN’s virtual demo of the tool ahead of Wednesday’s announcement, the AI search tool answered questions about why bees were so important to our ecosystem, whether the Sound Hotel in Portland, Oregon has Peloton bikes (it does) and what are some local chess camps for kids, in a matter of seconds.The tool scans websites, extracts related information and packages it neatly at the top of the results page, highlighting the sources in a section set off to the side.But it’s not perfect; in one search for the “best pizza places in New York City,” the results were populated with restaurants from San Francisco.Cathy Edwards, Google’s VP of search, told CNN that it’s still “very early on” and the company will continue to make changes in the weeks and months ahead.“We really want to learn and … and iron out the kinks,” Edwards said. “We don’t want to bring this experience to everyone until we have confidence that we’ve nailed it.”Unlike other chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Snapchat’s My AI tool and Bard, Google’s search tool is purposefully devoid of a “persona.”“We made a deliberate decision for it to only reflect information on the web,” Edwards said. “It won’t respond with ‘I think’ or express opinions on things. It is not something that feels like a lot of other chatbots out there.”But that choice can make for a jarring experience, if you’ve spent months using other tools. When CNN asked Google’s tool for suggestions on how to balance work and life with children at home, it offered no words of empathy or connection for the daily juggle, unlike other chatbots.The new Google Search also offers a Perspectives feature to showcase what other people are buying or thinking about, and factoring that into results. Another tool called, About This Image, understands facts about an image, so users can ask questions about when Google first saw the picture and if it appears on other websites. The feature aims to provide “a level of understanding of an image rather than taking it at face value,” Edwards said.These efforts highlight Google’s commitment to move forward with AI even as the technology behind it has sparked concerns.In March, Google was called out after a demo of Bard provided an inaccurate response to a question about a telescope. Shares of Google’s parent company Alphabet fell 7.7% that day, wiping $100 billion off its market value.Microsoft’s AI chatbot was also called out for errors made in a demo.Like ChatGPT, the new Google Search and Bard are built on a large language model. They are trained on vast troves of data online in order to generate compelling responses to user prompts, but these tools are also known to get responses wrong or “hallucinate” answers.Google previously told CNN that Bard would serve as a separate, complementary experience to Google Search, and planned to “thoughtfully” add large language models to search “in a deeper way” at a later time.“We’ve been on a 25 year journey for search, and it still remains such an unsolved problem,” Edwards said. “The next long arc which will be measured in decades will be this, so we want to be bold but want to be responsible and get it right.”",business,0.0
485,509,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/media/cnn-town-hall-donald-trump-reliable-sources/index.html,Analysis: CNN faces harsh criticism after Trump unleashed a firehose of lies during its live town hall,2023-05-11 07:33:00,"It’s hard to see how America was served by the spectacle of lies that aired on CNN Wednesday evening.Kaitlan Collins is as tough and knowledgable of an interviewer as they come. She fact-checked Trump throughout the 70-minute town hall. Over and over and over again, she told him that the election was not stolen. That it was not rigged. That there was no evidence for the lies he was disseminating on stage.“The election was not rigged, Mr. President,” Collins told Trump at one point during the event. “You cannot keep saying that all night long.”Yet, he did. Trump frequently ignored or spoke over Collins throughout the evening as he unleashed a firehose of disinformation upon the country, which a sizable swath of the GOP continues to believe. A professional lie machine, Trump fired off falsehoods at a rapid clip while using his bluster to overwhelm Collins, stealing command of the stage at some points of the town hall.Trump lied about the 2020 election. He took no responsibility for the January 6 insurrection that those very lies incited. And he mocked E. Jean Carroll’s allegations of sexual assault, which a jury found him liable for on Tuesday.And CNN aired it all. On and on it went. It felt like 2016 all over again. It was Trump’s unhinged social media feed brought to life on stage. And Collins was put in an uncomfortable position, given the town hall was conducted in front of a Republican audience that applauded Trump, giving a sense of unintended endorsement to his shameful antics.Yes, some news was made. The town hall spotlighted his insistence on continuing to peddle 2020 election lies. Additionally, he said the US should default on its debt if the White House does not agree to Republican spending cuts, refused to say whether he wants Ukraine or Russia to win the war, and declined to give a straight answer on abortion.But for most of the night, the nation’s eyes were transfixed on Trump’s abuse of the platform that he was given. At one point, he even insulted Collins, calling her a “nasty person,” to which the crowd of New Hampshire Republican primary voters broke out in cheers.“We don’t have enough time to fact-check every lie he told,” anchor Jake Tapper candidly said after the event wrapped up.Trump’s team was, naturally, delighted with the result, according to reports. “Advisers to Trump are thrilled at how this is going so far for him,” The NYT’s Jonathan Swan reported. “They can’t believe he is getting an hour on CNN with an audience that cheers his every line and laughs at his every joke.”Neither could anyone else.While Collins is largely receiving praise for her relentless fact-checking of the former president, she was facing an impossible task. CNN and new network boss Chris Licht are facing a fury of criticism — both internally and externally over the event.How Licht and other CNN executives address the criticism in the coming days and weeks will be crucial. Will they defend what transpired at Saint Anselm College? Or will they express some regret?For now, CNN is defending itself.“Tonight Kaitlan Collins exemplified what it means to be a world-class journalist. She asked tough, fair and revealing questions,” a network spokesperson said. “And she followed up and fact-checked President Trump in real time to arm voters with crucial information about his positions as he enters the 2024 election as the Republican frontrunner.”“That is CNN’s role and responsibility: to get answers and hold the powerful to account.”“The predictably disastrous [CNN] town hall was indeed disastrous,” television news vet Mark Lukasiewicz tweeted. “Proving again: Live lying works. A friendly MAGA crowd consistently laughs, claps at Trump’s punch lines - including re sex assault and Jan 6 - and the moderator cannot begin to keep up with the AR-15 pace of lies.” (Twitter)“This thing was madness, total madness,” Bill Carter said. “Like giving a microphone to Drunk Uncle and saying: go for it!” (Twitter)“This is CNN’s lowest moment as an organization,” James Fallows argued. (Twitter)“THIS is the 2024 Republican presidential primary,” Brian Stelter wrote. “Look away if you choose, but this is what it’s going to be like. Should news outlets sanitize it or stare it in the face?” (Twitter)To that point: “I have complaints, but I don’t really blame CNN for having a townhall with the GOP front runner,” Sarah Longwell argued. “It’s good to know what we’re facing. We can’t hide from the fight in front of us. Trump is probably going to be the nominee and we need to be clear-eyed about what we’re dealing with.” (Twitter)“This was a preview of what American journalism can expect from a 2024 campaign featuring Mr. Trump, who despite his ubiquity in political life has rarely appeared on mainstream TV outside of Fox News since leaving office,” Michael Grynbaum wrote. (NYT)Justin Baragona said CNN was walking away from the town hall “with a lot of egg” on its face. “At the same time, I feel like Kaitlan Collins is doing as good as she can in this situation,” he added. (Twitter)“Chris Licht said he wouldn’t allow anyone on his network that said it’s raining when it’s not,” Alex Sherman pointed out. “But he’s let someone on now who says it’s raining when it’s not, and he added hundreds of people to applaud when he does it.” (Twitter)“Trump seemed to have a significant home field advantage over Collins,” Jeremy Barr wrote. (WaPo)“Props to [Collins] who was in an impossible position but did a heroic job of fact-checking Trump throughout the town hall,” Peter Baker tweeted. “No easy task given how many factually untrue things he said in such a short time.” (Twitter)“Even in a world where [Collins] was correcting every Trump lie as they spewed forth — and we are pretty far from that world — the braying crowd would make Trump look like the victor,” contended Jonathan Chait. (Twitter)“This was not Kaitlin Collins’ fault,” Charlie Sykes said. “The format was impossible and CNN’s bosses should have known that.” (Twitter)“This format programmed her — and the country — for failure,” echoed Tom Nichols. (Twitter)“This isn’t [Collins’] fault (she is doing the best one can), but this is a gushing geyser of disinformation that is cannot be fact-checked in real time,” added Dan Pfeiffer. (Twitter)Democratic politicians were livid: “CNN should be ashamed of themselves,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said. (Twitter)Seung Min Kim reported that the televisions on Air Force One, which “are always” tuned to CNN, were changed to show MSNBC during the town hall. (Twitter)",politics,0.0

The advisory board, which had no real authority, was tasked with countering misinformation.“Over the course of eight months in 2022, Fox talked about Jankowicz more than 300 times,” said the lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware state court. “Across its broadcast and online publications, Fox’s employee hosts and commentators derided and lied about Jankowicz on repeat—and continue to do so even today.”Specifically, Jankowicz alleged in her lawsuit that Fox News defamed her by falsely asserting she had been fired from the board and that she “intended to censor Americans’ speech.” The lawsuit alleged that the coverage “led to violent threats against her.”“None of Fox’s false claims about Jankowicz were the product of honest mistakes in its reporting,” the lawsuit said. “Rather, Fox intentionally trafficked in malicious falsehoods to pad its profits at the expense of Jankowicz’s safety, reputation, and well-being.”Rylee Sommers-Flanagan, an attorney for Jankowicz, said in a statement that her client “is a disinformation expert who fell prey to disinformation peddled by the Fox News Channel.“Fox’s obsessive defamation of Nina’s character and professionalism unleashed a torrent of abuse which has caused her irreparable harm both personally and professionally,” she said. “We look forward to litigating this case in Delaware and to sending a strong message on behalf of millions of sane Americans that no one – not even Fox News – is shielded from the consequences of knowingly peddling lies.”Representatives for Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The lawsuit is the latest in a series of high-profile defamation cases brought against Fox News in recent years.The network last month settled a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million, the largest publicly known settlement in US history.Just weeks before, Fox News settled a lawsuit with a Venezuelan businessman who had sued the company over its election lies.Fox News is also facing a monster $2.7 billion lawsuit from the voting technology company Smartmatic.Smartmatic’s case survived a motion to dismiss filed by Fox News last year and continues to move through the court system. The company recently subpoenaed Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign.Fox News has denied wrongdoing in the Smartmatic case and has said it is “proud” of its 2020 election coverage, which included the promotion of conspiracy theories.Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive of Fox Corporation, the parent company of the right-wing channel Fox News, said on Tuesday that the company will fight Smartmatic’s lawsuit.",business,0.0

If those talks break down, they could lead to even broader work stoppages on film and television sets nationwide.SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents actors, is due to begin their own talks next month. The industry is undergoing major changes because of the shift to streaming, and all three sets of talks could prove difficult.Without a quick resolution, American audiences may be left without much new content to watch later this year or in early 2024.“We know there will be conflict,” said Todd Holland, a member of the directors’ negotiating committe, in a message to the union’s 19,000 members. “The battle will test us.  But we won’t rest until we win a strong contract today that builds a bridge to continued DGA prosperity into the future.”The shift to streaming has upended the economics of the industry. Most streaming services outside of Netflix have been losing money, although Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of CNN, just reported its first narrow profit from its streaming service.“The explosive popularity of streaming around the world has transformed how, and where, our work is viewed — and our contracts must adapt to changing production and distribution,” said Karen Gaviola, another member of the directors’ negotiating team.But the economics of traditional media are also becoming more difficult, with ad revenue slumping and movie box office still well below pre-pandemic levels.

489,513,https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/paying-taxes-with-credit-card,Can you pay taxes with a credit card in 2023? Everything you need to know,2023-05-11 14:12:00,"If you owe taxes this year, you might be wondering if it makes sense to pay your amount due with a credit card. This may sound like a dangerous idea, but there are times when it makes sense. For example, let’s say you’re in a situation where you expect to have the money to pay your taxes but not until a few weeks after the IRS deadline. You can use a credit card as a short-term loan to cover what you owe, then pay your credit card bill when you actually get the cash.You could also take advantage of a credit card with an introductory 0% interest rate in order to spread your tax payments out over months or even a full year. While the IRS offers payment plans, the agency will charge you interest for paying over time. You can avoid this by paying with a 0% interest credit card.Another reason to pay taxes with a credit card is to earn extra credit card rewards. There are fees involved in doing so, but if you can rack up enough rewards to make them worth more than the fee, you can still end up ahead if you pay your credit card bill in its entirety by the due date. This way, you’ll avoid paying any interest charges.Regardless of why you might want to use a credit card to pay your taxes, if you’re going to take the plunge, it’s important that you know how to do it and which cards to use to make the effort worthwhile.The best credit card to use when you pay your taxes depends a lot on what you hope to accomplish. Do you want to eke out a very small percentage in rewards, or do you hope to use your tax bill to earn a big bonus? Maybe you want to access an introductory 0% APR so you can pay off the balance over time. For each of these scenarios, here are our top picks for paying your taxes with a credit card:Each of these cards can be a great choice to use for paying your taxes, but before we dive into the details of what makes each card a good option, let’s explore the process of paying your taxes with a credit card so you know how to do it.The US government itself actually doesn’t accept credit cards for tax payments. However, it has authorized three companies to process federal tax payments made with a credit card on its behalf. Each of these companies charges a fee as a percentage of your tax payment when you pay with a credit card, so it’s important to keep in mind this cost when using your card to pay your tax bill.Fees vary depending on which company you use and whether you’re paying the IRS with a credit card or a debit card. Here’s a summary of the companies who accept credit cards for federal tax payments, and the fees each one charges as of this writing:In order to pay your taxes with a credit card, go to the website of the company you want to use and make the payment there instead of with the IRS. You’ll have to provide all your basic information to pay this way, such as your name, address, date of birth, contact info and taxpayer identification number (which for individuals is usually your social security number).Pro tip: Many states also let you pay state taxes with a credit card, so make sure to check for this option based on where you live. Don’t forget to compare the fees at multiple companies (if available) for paying state taxes with a credit card, which are often similar to the convenience fees charged to pay your federal taxes with a credit or debit card.As you can see from the chart, the minimum percentage you’ll currently have to fork over to pay your federal taxes with a credit card is 1.85%. This is a huge deterrent for rewards enthusiasts since many cash back credit cards offer less than a 1.85% return on your spending. In turn, this means you’d be paying more in fees by using a credit card than you’d get back in rewards.But with that being said, there are a few select credit cards that offer a higher earning rate or other incentives that can make using a card worth the cost. Let’s take a look at the best options.The Citi Double Cash Card can make sense if you have a large tax bill and you want to end up slightly ahead in rewards. This card earns 2% back for every dollar you spend — 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay it off.You can redeem any cash back earned with the Citi Double Cash by getting statement credits on your account or credits to a linked account, or even a check in the mail (a $5 minimum redemption applies when you’re requesting a check). But if you have a Citi Premier® Card, you can also use your Double Cash rewards — which technically come in the form of Citi ThankYou points worth 1 cent apiece in cash back — for travel and to transfer to Citi’s airline and hotel partners, which can potentially increase the value of your rewards and make paying your taxes with the card an even better deal.There’s no annual fee on the Citi Double Cash Card and you even get access to a 0% introductory APR on balance transfers for 18 months, after which you’ll pay a variable APR of 18.99% to 28.99%. That can be useful if you have existing debt on another credit card and need time to pay it off without racking up a lot of interest.Read CNN Underscored’s review of the Citi Double Cash Card.Click here to apply now for the Citi Double Cash Card.If you want to earn credit card rewards on your taxes, but your primary focus is to get some extra time to pay your taxes without incurring a lot of interest, the Chase Freedom Unlimited gives you the best of both worlds.This card earns 1.5% cash back on all purchases, including your tax bill. But to help you save on interest, the Chase Freedom Unlimited also gives new card holders an introductory 0% APR on both purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months after you open the account. Keep in mind that once the 15 months are up, the APR rises to a variable 19.74% to 28.49%, so it’s important to pay the balance in full before that.The Chase Freedom Unlimited has no annual fee and also earns 5% back on travel purchases made through Chase Ultimate Rewards, as well as 3% back on dining and drugstore purchases. And if you also have a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve®, you can convert your cash back into points that can be used for travel at even better redemption rates.Read CNN Underscored’s review of the Chase Freedom Unlimited.If you want your tax bill to translate into rewards that can take you on a sweet vacation, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is a good choice. This card is currently offering an increased 80,000 bonus points when you spend $4,000 within three months of opening the account.You’ll also earn 2 points on all travel (or 5 total points if purchased through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal), 3 points for every dollar you spend on dining, select streaming and select online grocery purchases with the Chase Sapphire Preferred and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. And through March 2025, you’ll earn 5 points per dollar spent on Lyft rides and eligible Peloton purchases (over $250, up to 25,000 total points).The card has a $95 annual fee, and the fact you’ll only earn 1 point per dollar on your tax bill is a major downside. However, it’s important to understand that the sign-up bonus of 80,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be worth $1,000 when you redeem those points for travel via the Chase travel portal.Also, Chase’s Ultimate Rewards program lets you transfer points earned with the Chase Sapphire Preferred to 14 popular airline and hotel partners, including United Airlines, Southwest, Hyatt, and Marriott hotels. It takes a little extra time and effort to use your points this way, but you can potentially get even more value for your rewards when you transfer them, especially when redeeming them for first or business class flights.Read CNN Underscored’s review of the Chase Sapphire Preferred.Click here to apply now for the Chase Sapphire Preferred.You may not know that It’s possible to earn a free hotel night just by paying your taxes. But take a closer look at the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass Card to see how it can work.The Hilton Surpass card earns a free night reward when you spend $15,000 on it within a calendar year. That means if you have a large tax bill, you could potentially pay it entirely on this card and quickly reach that spending threshold to bank a free night reward at a Hilton hotel.You’ll also earn 12 points for every dollar you spend on Hilton purchases with the Hilton Surpass card, 6 points per dollar at U.S. restaurants, U.S. supermarkets and U.S. gas stations and 3 points per dollar on all other purchases, including your tax bill. If you owe $15,000 in taxes and pay with your Hilton Surpass card, you’ll walk away with 45,000 Hilton Honors points and a free night certificate.Other benefits of the card include automatic Hilton Honors Gold elite status and 10 Priority Pass airport lounge visits each year. And while the the Hilton Surpass card does have a $95 annual fee (see rates and fees), if you don’t already have it, you can earn 130,000 bonus points and a free night reward after spending $2,000 in purchases on the card in the first three months after opening the account.Read CNN Underscored’s review of the Hilton Surpass credit card.Click here to apply now for the Hilton Honors Surpass card.The Blue Business Plus Credit Card from American Express is a great choice for small businesses looking to pay business taxes with a credit card. First, this card earns 2 points for every dollar you spend on all purchases, up to $50,000 each year, after which you’ll earn 1x points. There’s no annual fee, either (see rates and fees).American Express Membership Rewards points can be redeemed for cash back, used for Amazon purchases or to pay for travel at American Express Travel.

490,514,https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/earn-credit-card-bonuses,How to earn credit card bonuses without breaking your budget,2023-05-11 14:11:00,"Big credit card welcome bonuses are one of the best ways to earn travel rewards without flying. You can leverage these bonuses for incredible travel experiences with relatively low effort. Fancy a trip to the Maldives? You’re a few credit card sign-up bonuses away. Want an all-inclusive vacation covered entirely on points? There’s a card for that too.To earn those big bonuses, you often have to complete between $1,000 and $15,000 in your credit card spending within a specific period. Generally, the higher the welcome bonus, the larger the spending requirement. But you don’t have to downgrade to a lower sign-up bonus just because your spending ability isn’t on par with Jeff Bezos’.There are lots of ways to meet credit card spending requirements without going into debt or straying from your budget. Let’s take a look at a few ways to earn welcome bonuses without going into debt.When applying for a new credit card, consider any large purchases you have coming up. Timing your applications around these expenses can make spending requirements much more manageable. Whether it’s a home improvement project, a new mattress, back-to-school supplies or the holiday shopping season, you can knock out a lot more spending by organizing credit card applications around these purchases.Related: These are the best credit cards for large purchasesAn easy way to ensure you can meet spending requirements is to apply for a card with a low spending requirement. Plenty of rewards credit cards offer substantial welcome bonuses in exchange for spending $2,000 or less on a new card:There’s no better way to knock out a spending requirement than to use it for everyday purchases and bills. By setting your bills like home internet, cell phone service and utilities to autopay from your credit card, you’ll ensure they are paid on time while meeting credit card spending requirements.You can even prepay some larger bills like your insurance premium and even utilities. Of course, you’ll want to make sure that you have the funds available to pay off the card at the end of the month. There’s not much of a point in accruing a large balance if you end up paying interest on it — even if you are earning a substantial credit card sign-up bonus.Aside from automating and prepaying bills, you might also want to consider buying gift cards for future purchases. This might work out favorably on many fronts: Sometimes, stores like Office Max and Safeway offer discounted Visa and merchant gift cards. You can purchase these with your credit card and then use them for pre-budgeted expenses like groceries and dining.Before doing this, however, check your credit card’s terms. There may be language in its terms and conditions that exclude gift card purchases from counting toward spending requirements. But if you’re a few hundred dollars short, this might help you meet your spending requirement and stick to your monthly budget.Rent or mortgage payments are significant expenses for most folks, creating a fantastic opportunity to meet spending requirements without going into debt. There are several options for paying rent with a credit card and many overlap with how you can pay your mortgage.In most cases, you will pay a convenience fee of around 3%, or $30 per $1,000. It might be worth it if you’re earning a big enough sign-up bonus. Payment platform Plastiq occasionally runs promotions offering lower processing fees or waiving them altogether. Sometimes, you can even earn “Fee-Free Dollars” when you sign up using a referral link.Just note that Plastiq no longer accepts American Express cards and some issuers and card networks limit Plastiq payments to certain purchases. For example, Visa personal cards can only be used to pay rent, utilities, tuition (daycare and camps included), taxes and government fees, insurance and club fees with Plastiq. See this page on Plastiq’s website for the full list of restrictions.College tuition payments can be steep, but the glass is still half full. That’s because you can often channel this expense toward meeting credit card spending requirements. Many colleges accept credit cards for tuition payments, though you might end up paying a fee of 1.5% to 3%.If your institution doesn’t accept credit cards for tuition payments, Plastiq is a workaround. The platform allows you to make payments to various merchants, including universities. Just be sure to allocate additional time for processing so you don’t get hit with late fees. First-time payments to universities might take longer to process than rent payments.Like rent and mortgage payments, you’ll need to evaluate whether the points you’re earning are worth the fee. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card currently offers 80,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 within the first three months from account opening. The bonus is worth at least $1,000 toward travel, but potentially more if you utilize Chase Ultimate Rewards transfer partners. If you end up paying $250 in tuition payment fees to complete the spending requirement, you’re still coming out ahead.If you have a big tax bill to pay this April, look at the bright side: You can meet a credit card spending requirement at a reasonable rate. You can pay your taxes with a credit card for a 1.87% fee. That’s lower than the fees you’ll incur when paying rent or tuition through Plastiq.Enlisting help from a trusted friend, family member or significant other is a great way to meet spending requirements faster. You can do this by adding an authorized user to your account. Doing this is free in most cases (though some premium credit cards do add a fee) and lets you earn rewards when your friends or family members make a purchase.That said, you should only add an authorized user you fully trust. It’s your responsibility to pay for the authorized user’s purchases. It’s also a good idea to discuss big purchases ahead of time, along with expected repayment terms if you’re being reimbursed.If you don’t feel comfortable adding friends and family as authorized users, you can still enlist their help in meeting spending requirements. Get the word out that you have a spending requirement to meet and offer up your card for big purchases. And again, you’ll want to be clear on repayment expectations and only recruit people you trust.Years ago, I had a large spending requirement to meet on my American Express® Gold Card. My aunt was in the market for a new refrigerator. I met her at the store, swiped my card and had her pay off my credit card shortly after. I knocked out my credit card spending requirement and she got my gratitude.If all else fails and you fall short on your credit card spending goal, you can always ask for an extension. Banks are under no obligation to honor these requests, but you might encounter a sympathetic phone agent who can work some magic on your behalf. And after all, you don’t know until you ask!Click here for rates and fees of Delta Gold card.﻿Click here for rates and fees of Hilton Honors Amex.Looking for a new credit card?

491,515,https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/best-credit-cards-for-large-purchases,From appliances to electronics: 5 of the best credit cards for large purchases,"01:56 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","Whether you’re buying the new TV you’ve been longing for or replacing a kitchen appliance, making a large purchase is equal parts nerve-racking and exciting. You’re about to potentially upgrade your life with a new product, but you’re also parting with a lot of money and have a new liability on your hands.One way to soften the nervousness is to pay with a credit card. Depending on the card you pay with, you can earn bonus rewards, extend your time to pay for your purchase or even protect your new device with purchase protections offered by certain credit cards.But what card should you use? It all depends on what you’re looking for. Some cards are better for earning points while others are better for purchase protections. Likewise, some cards offer a large welcome bonus to new cardholders.Here, we’ll break down the 5 best credit cards for large purchases. We’ve broken the list down by cards best for purchase protection, financing and other benefits so you can find the best credit card for your next large purchase.Just because a card is listed as one of the best in this article doesn’t mean it’s the best for your large purchase or financial situation. We picked cards based on their posted benefits, fees and rewards earning rate. However, you should run the numbers and do your own research to see what card deserves a place in your wallet.Related: CNN Underscored’s credit card methodologyWho it’s for: Frequent travelers who want the best purchase protections for travel and big ticket purchases.Annual fee: $550.Rewards earning:Chase credit cards are known for their top-notch travel and purchase protections, and the Chase Sapphire Reserve offers the highest-end protections of the bunch. Eligible purchases are covered by Chase’s purchase protection for 120 days. During this time, your new purchase will be covered from damage and theft, up to $10,000 per claim and $50,000 per year.Further, it will be covered by extended warranty protection. This extends an eligible item’s manufacturer’s warranty for extra year so long as the standard warranty is three years or less. Like purchase protection, you’re covered up to $10,000 per claim and $50,000 per account with extended warranty protection.Large travel purchases are covered, too. The Sapphire Reserve has a variety of travel protections that cover you against delays, trip interruptions and more. On the delay side, if your flight, train or other mode of transportation is delayed by 6+ hours (or requires an overnight stay), you’ll be reimbursed for up to $500 in expenses per day. This includes hotel stays, food, taxi fare and other expenses.Additionally, you’re covered against situations that could interrupt your trip or cancel it altogether. The card’s included trip cancellation and trip interruption coverage will reimburse pre-paid and non-refundable travel expenses if your trip is canceled or cut short by illness, severe weather or other covered situations. This includes things like transportation, prepaid hotel reservations and hotels. This protection is limited to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per trip.There are a handful of other protections included with the card too, like a rental car damage waiver and lost luggage reimbursement. This makes the card a good choice for those who travel frequently and want to make large purchases on their card, as both items and travel are covered by top-notch purchase protection benefits.The card includes a variety of other benefits, like Priority Pass lounge access and an annual travel credit. But it also has a $550 annual fee, so make sure you’re able to use the benefits enough to offset it. This shouldn’t be hard for frequent travelers but might be difficult if you only travel one or twice per year.The main downside to using the Sapphire Reserve for large purchases is low earning on everything but travel and dining. So if you purchase a new laptop with your Sapphire Reserve, you’ll only earn 1 point per dollar on this purchase. Consider whether the included purchase protections are worth the low earnings.That said, it does offer some of the best purchase protections. If you plan to keep your purchase long-term, it could be worth putting the card on the Sapphire Reserve for the extended warranty benefit alone. Likewise, high-limits on purchase protection gives you peace of mind for the first 120 days after the date of purchase.Current welcome bonus: Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.Read our full review of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card.Learn more and apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve.Who it’s for: Those looking to take advantage of an extended introductory 0% APR interest rate with no annual fee (see rates and fees).Annual fee: None.Rewards earning:The Amex Blue Cash Everyday is a great option for those seeking extended 0% APR financing for their next big purchase. The card offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months from the date of account opening, then a variable APR between 18.74% to 29.74%.If you can pay your purchase off in the first 15 months of opening the account, you can effectively split your large purchase up across multiple payments without paying any fees. This is a huge benefit if you need to make an unexpected large purchase.Plus, if it’s an online purchase, you may be able to earn 3% cash back on your purchase, on up to $6,000 in purchases per year (then 1% cash back). This is due to the card offering 3% cash back on purchases from U.S. online retail purchases. This doesn’t apply to all online purchases, but we’ve seen reports saying that most common online retailers like Amazon and Walmart earn 3%.Cash back rewards are earned in the form of Rewards Dollars that can be redeemed for statement credits. This means you can use your rewards to effectively lower the cost of your large purchase, giving you a 1-3% discount depending on what you purchase.The Amex Blue Cash Everyday also offers a purchase protection benefit. Eligible purchases are covered against damage and theft for 90 days from the date of purchase, up to $1,000 per covered purchase and $50,000 per card per year. The only exception is purchases damaged due to a natural disaster. In this case, the card holder is covered for up to $500 per covered event.The Amex Blue Cash Everyday is best for those who want extra time to pay off their purchase. The introductory 0% APR for 15 months is one of the best on the market, though you should be sure to pay off your purchase before this rate expires due to the high APR that follows. Plus, you’re also eligible for cash back rewards and limited purchase protection benefits.Current welcome bonus: Earn $200 back after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months of opening the account. You will receive the $200 in the form of a statement credit.Read our full review of the Amex Blue Cash Everyday card.Learn more and apply now for the Amex Blue Cash Everyday card.Who it’s for: Consumers who want to earn the most cash back on a large purchase.Annual fee: None.Rewards earning: 2% cash back on all purchases; 1% when you spend and 1% when you pay your credit card balance.The Citi Double Cash is one of our favorite credit cards at CNN Underscored, and we use it as our benchmark card when reviewing other credit cards. This is in large part because of its earning structure. It earns 2% cash back on all purchases, split up into 1% when you make a purchase and another 1% when you pay your credit card balance.This provides a solid return on your large purchase. For example, if you spend $10,000 on new kitchen appliances, you’ll earn $200 cash back. This cash back is issued in the form of Citi ThankYou points which can be redeemed for statement credits or exchanged for a variety of other redemptions. If you also have a Citi Premier® Card in your wallet, you can transfer points earned with the Citi Double Cash to Citi’s various travel partners.That said, the card does not have significant purchase protections or a welcome bonus. However, it does offer a 0% introduction APR for balance transfers for 18 months from account opening. This then rises to a variable 18.99% to 28.99% APR. Note that the promotional APR does not apply to purchases.If you want to maximize your cash back earning, the Citi Double Cash can be a good bet. It’s also a solid option if you also have a Citi Premier card and want to earn extra Citi ThankYou points on your large purchase. Just note that there’s no purchase protections or welcome bonus.Current welcome bonus: None.Read our full review of the Citi Double Cash card.Learn more and apply now for the Citi Double Cash card.Who it’s for: Those wanting to earn flexible travel rewards on their large purchases.Annual fee: $95.Rewards earning: 2 points per dollar on all purchases.The Capital One Venture is another favorite in the travel rewards world. As noted, it earns 2 points per dollar on all purchases, regardless of the purchase category. This makes it advantageous for large purchases at retail stores and places that do not often earn bonus points with other travel rewards credit cards.The card earns Capital One miles which can be used to offset any travel charge at a rate of 1 cent per point. So if you charge a $50 Uber ride to your Capital One Venture card, you can redeem 5,000 points to offset your charge. You can also transfer Capital One miles to various airline and hotel transfer partners to get more value from your points.The card has one of the better welcome bonuses of the major travel cards too. Right now, it offers 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 on the card within three months of opening the account. This is worth a minimum of $750 when you redeem your points to cover travel purchases.Beyond rewards, you’ll also get purchase protection benefits with the Capital One Venture card. Eligible purchases are covered for theft and damage for up to 90 days from the date of purchase. However, it only covers up to $500 per claim, which is lower than the Chase Sapphire Reserve.The Capital One Venture card also has extended warranty protection that extends manufacturer warranties of up to three years by an extra year. This protection is limited to $10,000 per claim and $50,000 per year, so it should cover most purchases you make with the card. Just note that there are some exclusions — for example, used products and medical equipment — that are not covered.The Capital One Venture can be a good option if you’re seeking the most possible travel rewards on a large purchase. You’ll earn 2 points per dollar and enjoy extended warranty protection, which could be a huge benefit on expensive long-term purchases. Plus, it has a sizable welcome bonus that will jumpstart your rewards balance.Current welcome bonus: Earn 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 in the first three months from account opening.Read our full review of the Capital One Venture card.Who it’s for: Those seeking a large welcome bonus and free hotel stays.Annual fee: $95 (see rates and fees).Rewards earning:There are plenty of great welcome bonuses out there, but the Hilton Honors Surpass card offers one of the best. You can earn 130,000 bonus Hilton Honors points and a free night reward when you spend $2,000 on the card in the first three months of opening the account. Travel website The Points Guy values just the points part of this bonus at $780, but it’s possible to get more value depending on how you redeem your Hilton points. And then since the free night reward can be used at most Hilton properties, even those that could possibly go for $1,000+ per night, you can find yourself traveling in luxury in no time.The card earns 3 points per dollar on most purchases. Since Hilton Honors points are usually valued at 0.6 cents apiece, you’ll get an effective 1.8% return on your purchases. But again, you may be able to a higher return if you maximize your Hilton Honors points by booking high-end hotel stays.The Surpass card also has two spend bonuses. Card holders can earn a free night reward that can be redeemed at any Hilton property after spending $15,000 on the card in a single calendar year — which is in addition to the free night reward that comes with the current welcome offer. Further, the card includes Hilton Honors Gold elite status which can be upgraded to top-tier Diamond status by spending $40,000 on the card in a calendar year.Like most Amex cards, the Hilton Honors Surpass includes purchase protection. Eligible purchases are covered against damage and theft for 90 days from the day of purchase, up to $1,000 per covered purchase and $50,000 per calendar year. Like the Amex Blue Cash Everyday, damage due to natural disasters are covered up to $500 per covered event.The Hilton Honors Surpass card can be a good card to use for large purchases if you’re looking to earn a large welcome bonus that you can redeem for hotel stays. 130,000 Hilton Honors points can go a long way and be redeemed for free nights at virtually all Hilton properties — and that’s on top of the free night award.Current welcome bonus: Earn 130,000 bonus points and a free night reward after you spend $2,000 in the first three months of card membership.Read our full review of the Hilton Honors Surpass card.Learn more and apply now for the Hilton Honors Surpass card.Making a large purchase with the right credit card can help you earn bonus rewards and be eligible for valuable purchase protections. We recommend applying for the credit card you’d like to use for your purchase as early as possible to ensure it arrives before you need to make said large purchase.Before deciding on a card, make sure you think through the benefits, rewards and protections that you value the most. In some cases, it could be worth forgoing extra points for added purchase protections, like extended warranty protection offered by certain Chase credit cards. Other times, you may want to prioritize a large welcome bonus if you’re planning a big trip later in the year﻿Click here for rates and fees of the Blue Cash Everyday card.﻿Click here for rates and fees of the Hilton Surpass card.Find out which cards CNN Underscored chose as its best travel credit cards currently available.Get all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money.",business,0.0
500,524,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/health/covid-public-health-emergency-ends-gupta/index.html,Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The Covid-19 emergency is ending. It’s time for the patient to leave the hospital,2023-05-10 10:22:00,"After more than three very long years, it’s finally happening: The Covid-19 pandemic is ending, at least in the formal sense, both in this country and abroad. This moment is not being marked with parades or big parties but rather with the flourishes of two administrative pens. On Friday, the World Health Organization announced that Covid-19 no longer constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and this Thursday, the United States is set to end its own public health emergency declaration.So, what does that mean? Throughout the pandemic, I have written several essays about the United States as if it were my own patient. I think of the end of the public health emergency as my patient finally being discharged from the hospital after a lengthy illness. The hospitalization has been full of setbacks and improvements, stints in the ICU and then back to the general care floor, vital signs bordering on the catastrophic but also triumphs of modern medicine and human ingenuity.And although it is a very good sign that the patient is getting discharged, it doesn’t mean America (or the world) is entirely out of the woods. There will still be testing, close monitoring and follow-up appointments – all, hopefully, to prevent readmission.Last week, WHO’s International Health Regulations Emergency Committee met and decided that the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) should end because of declining Covid-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, and high levels of immunity in the population.The committee “advised that it is time to transition to long-term management of the COVID-19 pandemic,” and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus concurred.But like me, WHO plans to keep a close eye on the patient. The agency said that while the level of concern is lower, Covid-19 is still a global threat because the virus continues to evolve and spread.“While we’re not in the crisis mode, we can’t let our guard down,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead and head of its program on emerging diseases. She added that the disease and the coronavirus that causes it are “here to stay.”Long before WHO’s announcement, the US had designated May 11 as the day to end its public health emergency. It may feel like an arbitrary day, but it’s not as random as it seems.When Covid-19 was declared a US public health emergency on January 31, 2020, the nation was trying to head off the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2.The declaration – which has been renewed 13 times, typically in 90-day increments – essentially gave the government wide-ranging flexibility in the fight against the biggest public health crisis in a century. It enabled the government to temporarily implement certain policies and actions.For example, at the societal level, it allowed for a wider social safety net, the expansion of Medicaid in some states and the ability to prescribe controlled substances via telemedicine. At the individual level, it gave Americans free access to Covid vaccines, tests and treatments. It also permitted the government to keep its finger on the pulse of the pandemic by requiring states and other entities to report data such as test positivity rates, death rates and vaccination numbers.On February 9, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was extending the PHE one last time and said it would subsequently allow it to expire on May 11. This means an immediate end to some programs and actions; others will wind down more slowly, and some will remain in place.Another change: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will lose access to some of the data it’s been using to measure the severity of the pandemic and guide its public health recommendations.“It is the case at the end of the public health emergency, we will have less [of a] window as to the data,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week during a Senate committee hearing. “We will lose our percent positivity. We won’t get laboratory reporting. We won’t get case reporting. So we’ll lose some of that.”But Walensky, who is stepping down at the end of June, reiterated that the CDC is “not changing the steam at which we are working through this resolving this public health emergency.”The agency, she said, will keep a close eye on this virus around the country, utilizing more novel approaches like genomic sequencing and wastewater testing.We must remain vigilant. Nobody wants to see the patient readmitted to the hospital.If you look only at absolute numbers, the decision to end the PHE might make you scratch your head. After all, there were almost 9,900 new hospital admissions related to Covid in the US for the week ending May 1, and there were roughly 1,050 deaths per week at the end of April. Comparatively, when the first PHE declaration was signed at the end of January 2020, there were no deaths reported in the United States (the first US death wouldn’t be tallied until February 29). In fact, it wasn’t until February 10 that deaths worldwide topped 1,000.In medicine, however, numbers and data are important, but trends tell an even richer, more complete story.Imagine my patient, America, coming into the hospital when they first started feeling ill. Maybe their fever was 101 degrees, their pulse was fast, and they felt some malaise. I noted their vital signs – cases, hospitalizations and deaths – but what I really monitored was the trend. Were those numbers getting better or worse? Had the illness peaked, or was it only just getting started? In early 2020, all those numbers were trending in the wrong direction.But right now, the trends – in cases, hospitalizations and deaths – are all still high but thankfully moving in the right direction for my patient, our country.This is also true globally. “For more than a year, the pandemic has been on a downward trend,” WHO’s Tedros said Friday, explaining why the PHEIC declaration was coming to an end. But he said that he would not hesitate to declare a global health emergency again if there is a significant rise in Covid-19 cases or deaths in the future.To be clear, we have the ability to do much better and bring the numbers down much further before discharging our patient, but that raises a philosophical question, even more than a medical one: What are we willing to tolerate as a society in order to prevent illness and death?During the past three years, I would often speak with public health and other experts to try to work out exactly when we would move out of the pandemic phase and into the endemic stage of this health emergency. There were few hard answers. Instead, many told me that it came down to the number of Covid deaths we could stomach as a society, in exchange for an end to having our lives disrupted.At the time, I wrote: “At what point do we as a society throw up our hands and say, ‘We can’t do any better than this,’ so let’s call this level of sickness and death ‘endemic,’ accept the numbers and move on with our lives?”We seem to have collectively, emotionally reached that point. If the US weekly death rate at the end of April held steady for 52 weeks (or represented the average weekly death rate), we would have about 54,700 deaths per year. This puts Covid on par with a bad influenza season. And remember, when it comes to flu, less than half the adult population in the United States gets a vaccine every year.Solid medical science in the form of vaccines and effective public health strategies, such as high-quality masks and indoor ventilation, can get us only so far if there isn’t a collective will to use them.Many of us are ready for this chapter in history to be over, and truth be told, I am well aware that many people already moved on weeks – if not months – ago. But we must also remember that there is a substantial group of Americans who are still very worried about contracting Covid, in particular the older and the sicker.As you probably know by now, the CDC estimates that the risk of hospitalization for those 75 or older is between 9 and 15 times higher than for those who are 18 to 29, and here in the United States, nearly 25 million people are older than 75. When it comes to our general health, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that people with asthma had a 1.4 times higher risk of hospitalization than a healthy person, hypertension bumped up the risk to 2.8 times higher, chronic kidney disease to four times higher and severe obesity to 4.4 times higher. Someone with three or more health conditions had a five times higher risk. Forty percent of Americans are obese, and nearly 70% of the country has at least one of the conditions that greatly increases their risk.Therein lies one of the greatest lessons of the pandemic for my patient, the United States. While we had tremendous resources to combat this pandemic, our collective poor health put us at a tremendous disadvantage. We must do all we can to focus on the basics, because no amount of wealth can buy good health.For now, however, my patient is taking crucial steps out of the hospital and back into the world. I am elated.On the discharge papers, I write these parting instructions: Be prudent. Stay at home if you are sick. Talk to your doctor about keeping a course of oral antivirals (like Paxlovid) in your medicine cabinet if you are at higher risk of hospitalization or death. Remember what Dr. Anthony Fauci recently said: “If you are vaccinated and boosted and have available therapy, you are not going to die [of Covid], no matter how old you are.” That should be reassuring to people like my parents, who are now in their early 80s.And, yes, please use the formal end of the pandemic as a new beginning for yourself personally. Invest in yourself to get into the best possible health to feel better, happier and stronger now, as well as to weather any medical storm in the future.But most of all, go enjoy all the things that a major emergency or the threat of severe illness wouldn’t let you do. Call if you have any problems.I wish my patient well. I wish us all well.",health,0.0
501,525,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/health/over-the-counter-birth-control-fda-advisers/index.html,FDA advisers vote unanimously in support of over-the-counter birth-control pill,2023-05-10 15:56:00,"Advisers for the US Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously on Wednesday in support of making the birth-control pill Opill available over-the-counter, saying the benefits outweigh the risks.Two FDA advisory panels agreed that people would use Opill safely and effectively and said groups such as adolescents and those with limited literacy would be able to take the pill at the same time every day without help from a health care worker.The advisers were asked to vote on whether people were likely to use the tablet properly so that the benefits would exceed the risks. Seventeen voted yes. Zero voted no or abstained.Opill manufacturer Perrigo hailed the vote as a “groundbreaking” move for women’s health.“Perrigo is proud to lead the way in making contraception more accessible to women in the U.S.,” Murray Kessler, Perrigo’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “We are motivated by the millions of people who need easy access to safe and effective contraception.”The FDA doesn’t have to follow its advisers’ advice, but it often does. It is expected to decide whether to approve the over-the-counter pill this summer.If it’s approved, this will be the first birth-control pill available over the counter in the United States. Opill is a “mini-pill” that uses only the hormone progestin.At Wednesday’s meeting, Dr. Margery Gass of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine thanked the FDA for its consideration of switching Opill to an over-the-counter product.“I think this represents a landmark in our history of women’s health. Unwanted pregnancies can really derail a woman’s life, and especially an adolescent’s life,” she said.The FDA has faced pressure to allow Opill to go over-the-counter from lawmakers as well as health care providers.Unwanted pregnancies are a public health issue in the US, where almost half of all pregnancies are unintended, and rates are especially high among lower-income women, Black women and those who haven’t completed high school.In March 2022, 59 members of Congress wrote a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf about OTC contraception.“This is a critical issue for reproductive health, rights, and justice. Despite decades of proven safety and effectiveness, people still face immense barriers to getting birth control due to systemic inequities in our healthcare system,” the lawmakers wrote.A recent study showed that it’s become harder for women to access reproductive health care services more broadly – such as routine screenings and birth control – in recent years.About 45% of women experienced at least one barrier to reproductive health care services in 2021, up 10% from 2017. Nearly 19% reported at least three barriers in 2021, up from 16% in 2017.Increasing reproductive access for women and adolescents was a resounding theme among the FDA advisers.“We can take this opportunity to increase access, reduce disparities and, most importantly, increase the reproductive autonomy of the women of our nation,” said Dr. Jolie Haun of the James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital and the University of Utah.Dr. Karen Murray, deputy director of the FDA’s Office of Nonprescription Drugs, said the agency understands the importance of “increased access to effective contraception” but hinted that the FDA would need more data from the manufacturer.Some of the advisers and FDA scientists expressed concern that some of Perrigo’s data was unreliable due to overreporting of “improbable dosing.”Murray said the lack of sufficient information from the study poses challenges for approval.“It would have been a much easier time for the agency if the applicant had submitted a development program and an actual use study that was very easy to interpret and did not have so many challenges. But that was not what happened for us. And so the FDA has been put in a very difficult position of trying to determine whether it is likely that women will use this product safely and effectively in the nonprescription setting,” she said. “But I wanted to again emphasize that FDA does realize how very important women’s health is and how important it is to try to increase access to effective contraception for US women.”Ultimately, the advisers said, they don’t want further studies of Opill to delay the availability of the product in an over-the-counter setting.“I just wanted to say that the improbable dosing issue is important, and I don’t think it’s been adequately addressed and certainly leads to some uncertainty in the findings. But despite this, I would not recommend another actual use study this time, and I think we can make a decision on the totality of the evidence,” said Kate Curtis of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Curtis said she voted yes because “Opill has the potential to have a huge positive public health impact.”Earlier in the discussion, Dr. Leslie Walker-Harding of the University of Washington and Seattle Children’s Hospital said the pill is just as safe as many other medications available on store shelves.“The safety profile is so good that we would need to take every other medicine off the market like Benadryl, ibuprofen, Tylenol, which causes deaths and people can get any amount of that without any oversight. And this is extremely safe, much safer than all three of those medications, and incorrect use still doesn’t appear to have problematic issues,” she said.Dr. Katalin Roth of the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences also emphasized the safety of the pill over the 50 years it has been approved as a prescription drug in the US.“The risks to women of an unintended pregnancy are much greater than any of the things we were discussing as risks of putting this pill out out over-the-counter,” she said. “The history of women’s contraception is a struggle for women’s control over their reproduction, and we need to trust women.”",health,0.0
502,526,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/health/breast-cancer-screening-age-40-uspstf/index.html,"Women should start screening for breast cancer at age 40 instead of 50, health task force says in draft recommendation",2023-05-09 11:00:00,"The US Preventive Services Task Force is proposing that all women at average risk of breast cancer start screening at age 40 to reduce their risk of dying from the disease, according to a new draft recommendation statement.It’s an update to the 2016 recommendation, in which the task force recommended that biennial mammograms, which are x-rays of the breasts, start at age 50 and that the decision for women to screen in their 40s “should be an individual one.”Some groups, such as the American Cancer Society, already have been recommending for women to start mammograms in their 40s.“Our new task force recommendation is recommending that women start screening with mammography for breast cancer at age 40 and screen every other year until age 74,” said USPSTF Vice Chair Dr. Wanda Nicholson, a senior associate dean and professor at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health.The USPSTF, a group of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide doctors’ decisions and influence insurance plans, released the proposed update to its breast cancer screening guidance Tuesday. The recommendation is not final but will be available on the task force website for public comment through June 5, along with a draft evidence review and draft modeling report.The draft recommendation is for all people assigned female at birth, including cisgender women, trans men and nonbinary people, who are at average risk for breast cancer.Nicholson said that women with dense breasts and those with a family history of cancer generally fall into this category but not women who have a personal history of breast cancer or a family history of genetic mutations, like mutations on the BRCA gene, as they are considered to be at high risk.The updates would not apply to those at an increased risk of breast cancer, who may already have been encouraged to screen at 40 or earlier. They should continue to follow the screening practices that their doctors have recommended.Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States, and rates of death are highest among Black women.The update to the recommendation “will save more lives among all women,” Nicholson said. “And this is particularly important for Black women, who are 40% more likely to die from breast cancer.”The draft recommendation comes a few weeks after a study in the journal JAMA Network Open found that the rate of breast cancer deaths among women in their 40s was 27 per 100,000 person-years for Black women, compared with 15 deaths per 100,000 in White women and 11 deaths per 100,000 in American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander women. The researchers suggested that Black women start screening at younger ages, around 42 instead of 50.The USPSTF members are calling for more research into these racial inequities in breast cancer, Nicholson said, and for all women who get abnormal mammogram results to receive equitable follow-up evaluations, additional testing, biopsies and treatment when needed.“Screening alone is not enough. Once someone screens with an abnormal mammogram, the subsequent steps in care must occur – timely follow-up, biopsies that are indicated – and Black women must have access to equitable treatment,” she said.“We’re calling for more research to look across the health systems as to why these inequities occur,” she said, adding that the draft recommendation also calls for more research into whether women with dense breasts should get additional screening and among “women who are 75 years of age and older, whether and how to screen that population.”To review and update breast cancer screening guidance, the task force members analyzed data from thousands of study abstracts and hundreds of research papers on screening programs, cancer cases and deaths in the United States.They found that screening with mammograms every other year provided a moderate benefit to women ages 40 to 74, as the benefits, such as detecting cancer early, outweigh potential harms, such as the risk of a false positive that could lead to unnecessary tests and emotional stress.The evidence is “insufficient” to determine the risks and benefits for screening in women 75 and older, the group determined.The task force also noticed that the rate of breast cancer diagnoses has been rising each year among women at younger ages.Population-based data “showed that the rate of breast cancer diagnoses was increasing at 2% annually since 2015. So more women than ever before are being diagnosed in their 40s,” Nicholson said.An estimated 12.9% of women born in the United States today will develop breast cancer at some time during their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute.“Within our recommendation, we’re calling for more research to have a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms that may be contributing to breast cancer development in all women, and in particular among Black women,” she said. “We know that Black women continue to have more aggressive tumors.”A paper published in October in the journal Nature suggests that the incidence of various cancers diagnosed in adults 50 and younger has been rising in many parts of the world since the 1990s.“The rising incidence of early-onset cancers is probably partially attributable to increasing uptake of screening and early detection before the age of 50 years, to variable degrees across certain cancer types, especially breast, prostate and thyroid cancers,” the researchers wrote.“However, increasing incidence of early-onset cancers in several organs, such as colorectal and pancreatic cancers, which might not be fully explained by screening is also apparent,” the researchers wrote. “This trend could reflect increased risk factor exposures in early life and/or young adulthood.”The draft recommendation appears to be catching up with what other organizations have been recommending for some time.It aligns more closely – but not entirely – with American Cancer Society recommendations that women ages 40 to 44 have the option to screen with a mammogram every year, women 45 to 55 get mammograms every year, and women 55 and older can switch to a schedule of mammograms every other year.“There are some similarities and some differences. So, now, the new task force recommendations has changed from screening at age 50 to age 40. And our recommendations currently are that women should begin to have the opportunity to begin annual screening if they choose beginning at age 40. The big difference there is, we recommend annual screening at that age, while the task force recommends biennial screening,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the USPSTF draft recommendation.“But the big thing is, I think, a lot of women were being screened probably starting in their 40s, and so this is consistent, I think, with how most women and practitioners have been looking at screening,” he said.Both the USPSTF and the American Cancer Society recommendations are for women at average risk. Dahut said that women should talk to their doctors about whether they might have a higher risk for breast cancer and what screening practices would be best for them, including factors like a family history of ovarian or breast cancer or dense breasts, which have less fatty tissue and more connective tissue and have been associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.“The change in guidelines by the USPSTF to endorse screening mammograms for average risk women 40 and over is warranted, incorporates more modern and ‘real world’ data into the science informing the guidelines and will hopefully prompt payers to provide better coverage for women seeking breast cancer screening,” Dr. Laura Dominici, a breast cancer surgeon at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center, said in an emailed statement. She was not involved in the USPSTF draft recommendation.“This is particularly important related to racial disparities in screening, as Black women are more likely to develop aggressive cancers at younger ages, contributing to worse outcomes,” Dominici said. “I am glad to see inequities in screening being acknowledged, but more attention to this will be needed in future guidelines.”Still, the new draft recommendation will not change how Dr. Maxine Jochelson discusses breast cancer risks and the important of screening with her patients, she said.“Unfortunately, the fact that they’re still recommending every other year rather than yearly screening, and in particular in the younger population, is very disappointing,” said Jochelson, chief of the breast imaging service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in the USPSTF draft recommendation.“You are going to miss earlier cancers if you’re waiting longer, and younger women and Black women often have more aggressive cancer,” she said. “I’m going to still tell them to have yearly screening.”",health,0.0
503,527,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/health/human-pangenome-scn-wellness/index.html,Scientists have updated the human genome to make it more equitable and inclusive,2023-05-10 11:13:00,"Scientists have pieced together a new draft of the human genome that better captures humanity’s genetic diversity.The new “pangenome” incorporates the DNA of 47 individuals from every continent except Antarctica and Oceania. The scientists involved say it will improve our ability to diagnose disease, discover new drugs and understand the genetic variants that lead to ill health or a particular physical trait.Until now, geneticists have used a single human genome, largely based on one individual, as a standard reference map for the detection of genetic changes that cause disease. This has likely missed some of the genetic diversity between individuals and different populations around the world.“This pangenome reference represents an incredible scientific achievement, providing an expanding view of humanity’s DNA blueprint, with significantly greater human diversity than previous reference sequences,” Eric Green, the director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute, which funded the project, told a news briefing.“Having a high quality human pangenome reference that increasingly reflects the diversity of the human population will enable scientists and healthcare professionals to better understand how genomic variants influence health and disease, and move us towards a future in which genomic medicine benefits everyone,” Green said.The pangenome, a digital amalgamation of sequences that can be used to compare, construct and study other human genome sequences, is still a draft.  Researchers hope to include 350 people by the middle of 2024. The scientific milestone was detailed in several papers published Wednesday in Nature and its partner journals.“You can imagine this as a new road map to drop off your kids at school. While you only take the same road every day, your neighbour might take a slightly different road on a side street,” said Benjamin Schwessinger, an associate professor at The Australian National University who wasn’t involved in the project.“This new approach of a ‘pan-genome’ maps out these alternative routes that make us humans so distinct from each other,” Schwessinger said in a statement.While each person’s genome varies only slightly — by about 0.4% compared to the next person on average — the human genome is massive, consisting of 3.2 billion pairs end to end. This means that there’s still many important genetic differences between individuals and populations around the world.The four building blocks of DNA — adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) — form specific pairs and the binding of these base pairs forms the structure of DNAGenomic variation can be small, consisting of differences of just one or a few DNA bases, or it can be large structural variants, that are 50 base pairs or larger. These larger, structural variants can have important health implications, such as in the functioning of the immune system.The new reference incorporates more diverse genetic sequences and adds 119 million base pairs to the library of 3.2 billion previously known base pairs that make up the human genome, deepening our understanding of human genetic diversity and making it more complete.“The pangenome reveals the architecture of variation and how it affects genes and will have a major impact on genomics research,” said Benedict Paten, an associate professor of biomolecular engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and associate director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.“It also reveals new biology … we’re getting a better picture for how some of the most complex regions of the genome vary. Until now, the composition of these fast evolving regions has largely been invisible to us,” Paten said.The first draft of the human genome was released in 2001 and was only fully completed in 2022. It has been an invaluable tool for researchers, launching a new era for scientific discovery, technological innovation and genomic medicine, said Karen Miga, assistant professor in the biomolecular engineering department at the University of California, Santa Cruz and associate director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.“Understanding and cataloging these differences between genomes will allow us to understand how cells operate, their biology and how they function, as well as understanding genetic differences and how they contribute to understanding human disease,” Miga said.The original human reference genome was predominantly based on anonymous volunteers who responded to an ad placed in the Buffalo Evening News in March 23 1997, with one donor accounting for 70% of the sequence, according to the NHGRI.The 47 anonymous individuals included in the first draft of the pangenome project were among those who participated in the 1000 Genomes Project, a catalog of common human genetic variation that was completed in 2015.  The team is in the process of recruiting new individuals to represent some populations not included in the 1000 Genomes Project, particularly people of Middle Eastern and African ancestry.Other projects aimed at broadening genomic databases have “often missed the mark in demonstrating respect” for communities in lower-income countries and indigenous people, who say their samples and data are being used to further the goals of scientists and institutions in rich countries, a Nature paper published last year on the pangenome project noted.The team was keen to avoid any similar mistakes. Barbara Koenig, professor emeritus of medical anthropology and bioethics at the University of California, San Francisco, said ethical considerations and “the principle of justice” were a key part of the endeavor.",health,0.0
504,528,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/health/dea-extends-telehealth-controlled-medication-wellness/index.html,"People can get controlled medications via telehealth for awhile longer, DEA says",2023-05-09 18:09:00,"As the expiration of the Covid-19 public health emergency declaration approaches, the US Drug Enforcement Administration has extended the flexibilities regarding the prescription of controlled medications via telehealth.Before the pandemic, medical practitioners were subject to the conditions of the Ryan Haight Act, which required at least one in-person medical examination before prescribing a controlled medicine, Dr. Shabana Khan, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s Committee on Telepsychiatry, told CNN in a previous story on the flexibilities.Controlled medications include stimulant medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepines for anxiety, or medications for opioid use disorder, sleep or pain. The DEA’s website has a general list of controlled substances, and an exhaustive list can be found here.One exception to this act has been a public health emergency declared by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, which has been in place for the past three years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“It was immensely helpful,” Khan said, “and allowed many Americans to get their medical care without having to come in person, so we could treat patients completely remotely.”With the public health emergency set to end May 11, on March 1 the DEA issued two proposals that would establish some flexibility in the telehealth framework moving forward, Khan said: The proposals would allow telehealth practitioners to prescribe one 30-day supply of buprenorphine — a medication for opioid use disorder — or Schedule III-V non-narcotic controlled medications without doing an in-person exam first. A patient would have to do an in-person exam before the second prescription of either type of medication, according to those proposals.The agency received more than 38,000 messages during the period for official public comment, which was open through March.Before today’s DEA extension, without a guarantee that those proposals would be approved, patients who have been getting certain controlled medications would have had to prepare so they didn’t experience a disruption in care. But now, while the DEA and HHS consider the public comments and revisions to the proposed rules, the DEA and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration have decided these telehealth flexibilities will remain in place for six more months — through November 11.“We take those comments seriously and are considering them carefully,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a news release. “We recognize the importance of telemedicine in providing Americans with access to needed medications, and we have decided to extend the current flexibilities for six months while we work to find a way forward to give Americans that access with appropriate safeguards.”Ultimately there will be a final, permanent set of regulations, according to the DEA.Additionally, “if a patient and a practitioner have established a telemedicine relationship on or before November 11, 2023, the same telemedicine flexibilities that governed the relationship to that point are permitted until November 11, 2024,” according to the DEA (PDF).This means any practitioner-patient telemedicine relationship beginning after November 11 will be subject to pre-pandemic rules unless a new final rule saying otherwise is in place by then, according to a DEA spokesperson.The DEA’s decision has been praised by the American Medical Association’s chair of its Substance Use and Pain Care Task Force, Dr. Bobby Mukkamala.“These medications, including those used to treat opioid use disorder, are a vital form of care for millions of Americans who have come to rely on safe and effective telemedicine appointments,” Mukkamala said in a statement. “Patients being treated with these medications often have challenges securing and traveling to in-person appointments. We are grateful the DEA is approaching this issue with the gravity it deserves, and we look forward to reviewing the details of the policy when they become available.”",health,0.0
505,529,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/health/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine/index.html,An mRNA vaccine that programs the body to fight pancreatic cancer shows early promise,2023-05-10 19:29:00,"When Barbara Brigham was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in September 2020, the odds were not in her favor.Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies, fatal in 88% of patients.  It is also one of the hardest to treat. Tumors can be surgically removed, but they come back within seven to nine months in 90% of patients.  Chemotherapy can help prolong life, but it too is rarely a cure. Radiation, immunotherapy and targeted therapies also don’t work.Today, nearly three years after her diagnosis, Brigham says regular scans find no trace of cancer in her pancreas.  She credits an experimental therapy – a personalized cancer vaccine – being tested by BioNTech, one of the companies that helped make the mRNA vaccines for Covid-19.Brigham was one of 16 participants in a recent test of the new technology.  The results of the study were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.Of the 16 patients who were able to complete all phases of the study, eight responded to the vaccine, which taught their immune systems how to recognize and fight off the cancer cells.  None of those eight has seen their cancer return.In blood tests, all eight responders made T-cells against their tumors, and those have persisted for at least two years despite a followup course of chemotherapy.Among the eight patients who did not respond adequately to the vaccine, just two have not seen their cancer return.“I think it’s really promising. It highlights the mRNA platform and the versatility to be able to personalize or tailor these vaccines to each patient’s specific tumor and generate these customized vaccines in a fairly short amount of time,” said Dr. Neeha Zaidi, an oncologist at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center who was not involved in the new research.“It remains to be seen, but certainly very exciting preliminary results,” she said.The study wasn’t designed to test whether the vaccines would be effective.  Researchers mostly set out to see whether the therapy would be safe and even feasible. They also wanted to see if the three-stage regimen they were testing would create the desired immune responses.The researchers were looking for any correlation between whether the vaccine worked and whether it created a clinical benefit.  Sometimes, drugs do what they’re supposed to do, but for whatever reason, they don’t treat the disease.“I think it’s definitely very encouraging to see that [an immune] response correlates with recurrence-free survival. However, it is a small study with only 16 patients in phase one. So it is a correlation. It’s not causation. We do have to test causation in a larger clinical trial,” said Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who led the study.He says plans for that research are already in the works.For this first study, doctors surgically removed the patients’ tumors and sent the tissue to a lab in Germany where scientists sequenced genetic code from the tumors and from the patients’ blood.  They compared those sets of genes to find the ones that were altered in the cancer cells.  After they identified the changed genes, they ran them through a computer program to let it pick the ones that would make the most effective targets.Then they made their personalized mRNA vaccines.  Patients got eight doses, which were infused into their bloodstream rather than injected into their muscles, as the Covid-19 vaccines are.  That’s because researchers were trying to stimulate a slightly different part of the immune system.“The type of immune response you want to elicit is slightly different from the type of immune response that you want to elicit against a virus, where it’s mostly antibody responses, and for cancer, you try to actually induce T-cell responses,” Balachandran said.Blood circulates through the lymph system, where lymph nodes and lymph organs like the spleen help make T-cells.After the eight “immuno” doses, as Brigham calls them, the patients got six months of chemotherapy.  Then they got a last booster of the vaccine.“It wasn’t easy to get through.  It was a little difficult,” Brigham said. She tolerated the vaccine doses pretty well but did go to the hospital twice during chemotherapy.Now, she has scans every three months to check her pancreas, but so far, the cancer has not returned.Not all of the participants fared as well as she did, though. Eight others didn’t develop an adequate pool of programmed T-cells in response to the vaccine, and the researchers have a theory about why.There are two main types of pancreatic cancer surgery, Balachandran says.  One involves the removal of the spleen along with the tumor.It turns out that the mRNA vaccine concentrates in the spleen, which seems to be important to developing that large pool of tumor attacking T-cells.When researchers gave the vaccine to mice that had had their spleens removed, they didn’t respond as well as the ones with their spleens intact.Seven of the study participants had had their spleens removed, and five of them were in the group that didn’t respond well to the vaccine, Balachandran said.  He notes that in this small study, the difference was not statistically significant, but it might be in a larger trial.“So this is our current working hypothesis,” he said.Brigham says she is just thankful she could participate.“I am just so grateful to have been allowed to take it,” the 77-year-old says.  She was recently able to watch her oldest grandchild graduate from college – a moment she didn’t think she’d live to see.“The opportunity and timing was so perfect. It helped me, and I hope it helps someone else.”",health,0.0
506,530,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/health/chemo-drug-shortages/index.html,Cancer drugs among top 5 most affected by shortages in the US,2023-05-11 19:43:00,"As the US faces a near-record number of drug shortages, cancer treatments are among the hardest hit.There is an active shortage of about two dozen chemotherapy drugs, the fifth most of any drug category, according to data from the end of March from the University of Utah Drug Information Service.“The fact that we have this many chemo drugs in shortage is really concerning,” said Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.Unlike some other drugs  that also rank among the top five categories for shortages, such as antimicrobials, there aren’t often alternatives for chemotherapy drugs, he said. And the shortages are affecting treatment for a broad range of cancers.“One of the key predictors of how well a patient will respond to treatment is getting a full dose on the right schedule,” Ganio said. “So when we can’t give the drug because we just can’t get the drug, that’s heartbreaking.”Overall, data from the University of Utah shows that there were more than 300 drugs with an active shortage in the US at the end of March, including nearly 50 new shortages that accumulated in the first three months of the year.The last time active drug shortages – including both newly reported and ongoing – were this high was in 2014, the data shows.“Shortages are still happening, and they’re not resolving, or they’re not resolving as quickly as new shortages are starting,” Ganio said.On Thursday, the US House of Representatives’ Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing exploring the root causes of these shortages.Increased demand is part of it. But experts say that some high-profile shortages – such as amoxicillin during the most recent respiratory virus season and Adderall for ADHD – are the exception.“They don’t really tell the story of drug shortages,” Ganio said.Instead, the hearing was more heavily focused on manufacturing issues and the broader structure of the drug market in the US.The US Food and Drug Administration, in particular, was criticized for falling behind on inspections, especially of international facilities that represent more than half of manufacturers that supply the US.A report from the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, in January 2022 noted “longstanding challenges” facing the FDA’s Foreign Inspection Program and called for more formal steps to improve it.Effective inspections of both domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities are “absolutely essential for ensuring the quality and the safety of the medicines that US citizens consume,” said Anthony Sardella, chair of the API Innovation Center, a nonprofit focused on building the supply of US-made pharmaceuticals.“They’re also extremely important in ensuring the stability of the market,” said Sardella, who was a witness at the hearing.But in a hearing Thursday of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said that the economic issues underlying drug shortages are “not in the purview of the FDA.”The FDA is “plugging holes in the dike,” he said, but it’s difficult to motivate change when it’s not profitable for drug companies.“These drug shortages are becoming more prevalent due to a warped marketplace,”  said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Florida, ranking member on the subcommittee.“The current haphazard approach of addressing crisis episode-by-episode is not working to give American families the certainty and the quality of care they need and deserve.”Hundreds of impending shortages loom, and Califf called on drug companies to alert the FDA to them.“Each company doesn’t know what the other company’s doing because they’re competing,” he said. “When there’s a shortage in one company, we need to be able to coordinate across these people.”Outside of the FDA, there is a small team of officials at the White House focused on bolstering drug supply chains and quality, a senior administration official confirmed to CNN. The team was first reported by Bloomberg News.The team, the senior official said, has been “meeting for some time” and is made up of “several” White House offices, including the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic Council.“The Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on strengthening the resilience of critical supply chains, including for medical products like pharmaceuticals,” the official said, pointing to five executive orders issued by President Joe Biden since taking office aimed at “[catalyzing] whole-of-government action toward these objectives.”Blame aside, patients remain at the heart of the issue.“There is severe patient impact happening every day,” said Laura Bray, founder of Angels for Change, an advocacy group focused on ending drug shortages. “We also can’t forget the emotional trauma that you’re putting on a family in medical crisis.”She experienced it firsthand in 2019 when her 9-year-old daughter, Abby, couldn’t get the drug needed to treat her leukemia because there was a shortage.Abby is doing well now, but 9 out of 10 oncologists say that drug shortages have led to patient harm, including death, said Bray, who was a witness at the Oversight hearing Thursday.“Patients deserve access to these medicines. The physicians and nurses and care team who are trying to solve these crises and save them deserve easy and equal access to these medicines.”",health,0.0

Lisa McClain, R-Michigan, said that the FDA has not been fully forthcoming with Congress and the public.“Why was the FDA unprepared for the crisis?” she asked in her opening statement.She said that the agency failed to prioritize food safety. “The FDA has not taken the action needed to prevent a similar crisis from happening again.”Rep. Katie Porter, D-California, said she agreed with McClain that another shortage could happen, “and that is a deadly serious problem.”“There is a lot of blame to go around,” Porter added. “It’s clear with today’s witness selection that Republicans want to blame the FDA, and I’ll level with you, I think some of that blame is well-placed. We’ve had two subsequent infant formula recalls in 2023 already, and we’re still seeing that the FDA can make further improvements on internal processes, intervene in issues sooner and follow through with more inspections to prevent further contamination.”Three major manufacturers in the US control over 90% of the formula market, and that consolidation is a “serious concern” that “contributed significantly to shortages,” according to Dr. Susan Mayne, director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, who testified Thursday.A shortage that started in 2021 was exacerbated when the country’s largest infant formula maker, Abbott Nutrition, recalled multiple products in mid-February 2022 and had to pause production at its plant in Sturgis, Michigan, after FDA inspectors found potentially dangerous bacteria.The plant inspection was tied to an outbreak of Cronobacter sakazakii that had sickened at least four infants and killed two, although investigations did not find a genetic link between bacteria samples from the facility and bacteria found in the water and powder used to mix the formula that the infants had consumed.Mayne testified that it was difficult to trace the cases and determine how big of a concern the outbreak was. The bacteria is a common pathogen in the environment “but one about which we have limited information.”The FDA has urged the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make Cronobacter infection a notifiable disease – meaning providers would be required to report cases to local or state public health officials –  so public health experts would be able to more quickly determine the source of any contamination.In addition to the bacteria, an FDA inspection of the Sturgis plant found unsanitary conditions and several violations of food safety rules.A whistleblower had alerted the FDA to alleged safety lapses at the plant in February 2021, months before Abbott’s formula was recalled. The complaint suggested that the plant lacked proper cleaning practices and that workers falsified records and hid information from inspectors.Like other FDA leaders who have been called before Congress, Mayne testified that she was not made aware of the complaint right away. She called it “a failure of escalation.”“I do wish I had been made aware of this particular whistleblower complaint, but just to reiterate, the complaint was acted upon,” Mayne said. However, she noted, it was “less than ideal” how quickly there was an FDA inspection of the plant and how quickly the agency was able to act.When the whistleblower made the complaint, there was no process within the FDA to escalate it. The process has since changed so that if a complaint meets certain criteria involving vulnerable populations, hospitalizations or deaths, leadership would be immediately informed. If a consumer complaint involves an infant death or hospitalization, it also immediately gets escalated to leadership.To prevent future shortages, Mayne testified, it won’t just be the FDA that needs to change. The industry should do more to adopt enhanced food safety measures to “deliver the safest possible” infant formula, she said.The agency would also like better regulations. There have been been two infant formula recalls already in 2023, and in neither case was the manufacturer required to notify the FDA that it had found contamination before the formula left the plant.The FDA has asked formula makers to inform the agency about positive tests, but such reporting is only voluntary. If it were mandatory, the FDA could know about problems in real time and could take action.“Our food safety experts, our compliance experts can work with the manufacturers,” Mayne said. In such a collaboration, they could quickly identify what product to focus on to prevent a shortage.The FDA has taken recent steps to improve. In February, it announced that it is restructuring its food division to be more responsive and that it is creating an office of critical foods. The FDA is also hiring specialized infant formula inspection staff, Mayne said.The infant formula supply is generally in good shape, she said, but there are still some distribution issues.The in-stock rate is near 90%, even higher than pre-recall levels. But some rural areas are having a hard time getting all the formula they need.Formula manufacturers have been producing more than is being purchased week after week to build up supply, Mayne said. The Biden administration has also worked to bring in formula from manufacturers overseas.But another shortage is not out of the question, particularly if one of the country’s main manufacturers is taken offline for any significant amount of time.“We never want to have this happen again,” Mayne said.Lawmakers have proposed significant cuts, about 22%, to the FDA’s budget for 2023. Mayne said that consumers and the industry would be “adversely affected” if the cuts go through.“Broadly, across the FDA, I can say it would be devastating,” she said, resulting in a loss of 32% of domestic inspections and 22% of foreign inspections. The cuts would also disproportionately affect its food programs, which get much of their funding from the budget, unlike divisions involving drugs that get money from user fees.“We would be unable to do what I think American consumers expect us to do,” Mayne said.",health,0.0

Going forward, prospective donors will be asked the same set of questions regardless of their sex or sexual orientation.Before the FDA began taking a second look at its guidance several years ago, gay and bisexual men had faced a lifetime ban on blood donation, a move that many said was discriminatory. The most recent policy recommended that men who have sex with men wait three months after sexual contact with other men before they could donate blood.The policy changes eliminate deferrals and screening questions specific to men who have sex with men (MSM) and women who have sex with MSM. It brings the United States in line with other countries such as the UK and Canada, which have also implemented risk-based rules.“It’s going to make a donation more inclusive. It ensures that all donors are treated equally. It enables more people the opportunity to donate blood. So anytime more people are able to enter the donor pool safely, that is a good thing. And this really is the start of a new era of blood donor eligibility,” said Susan Forbes, senior vice president of corporate communication and public relations for OneBlood, a system of blood collection centers that serves hospitals in the Southeast.Forbes said OneBlood is moving quickly to implement the new guidance, which means it will have to update its donor history questionnaire.  “So there was a lot of regulatory steps to do it, but we’re doing it as quickly as possible,” Forbes said.The new questions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, through blood donation. The FDA says it made the changes after reviewing data from other countries that have similar rates of HIV and that have implemented risk-based eligibility for blood donations, information on the accuracy of tests to detect HIV, surveillance information from a system that monitors infections passed by transfusions, and information on individual risk factors gleaned from a government-funded study.Under the new questions, anyone who had a new sexual partner and anal sex, or who had multiple sexual partners and anal sex within the last three months, would be asked to wait at least three months from their most recent sexual contact to donate blood.Anyone taking medications to treat or prevent HIV, such as PrEP, would also be deferred from donation. The FDA says that although HIV is not transmitted during sex in people whose viral levels are are undetectable, the same does not apply to blood donation. Blood is transfused directly into a vein and involves a larger volume of fluid, making it inherently riskier than sexual contact.The FDA advises against HIV medication or PrEP to donate blood.Sarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of GLAAD, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said the new recommendations signal “the beginning of the end of a dark and discriminatory past rooted in fear and homophobia,” but argued that by excluding people taking PrEP, they didn’t go far enough.“Placing potential blood donors taking PrEP in a separate line from every other donor adds unnecessary stigma. The bias embedded into this policy may, in fact, cost lives. GLAAD urges the FDA to continue to prioritize science over stigma and treat all donors and all blood equally,” Ellis said in a statement posted on their organization’s website.The FDA says the guidance to industry is a recommendation. Blood banks aren’t required to follow it, so policies may differ slightly from place to place. The FDA does have to approve the language used on donor history questionnaires, however, so most blood banks hew to its recommendations.“The FDA has worked diligently to evaluate our policies and ensure we had the scientific evidence to support individual risk assessment for donor eligibility while maintaining appropriate safeguards to protect recipients of blood products. The implementation of these recommendations will represent a significant milestone for the agency and the LGBTQI+ community,” said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.Marks said the agency would continue to closely monitor the safety of the US blood supply after the rules are implemented.",health,0.0
509,533,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/health/ringworm-treatment-resistant-us-cases/index.html,First US cases of treatment-resistant ringworm found in patients in New York City,2023-05-11 16:50:00,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting the first known cases of an antifungal-resistant ringworm in the United States and urging providers to be on the lookout for such infections.The details of the cases were reported to the CDC in February and shared in a report published Thursday. The patients – two unrelated women in New York City – first had symptoms in 2021 and 2022. One patient had no international travel history, suggesting that there is some community spread in the US.Despite the name, ringworm is not caused by a worm; rather, it is caused by one of 40 species of fungus. In this case, the infections were caused by Trichophyton indotineae, a recently discovered fungus.Cases were first concentrated in patients in South Asia, but they’ve now also been found in countries in Europe. These are the first known US cases.Ringworm can take several forms but often causes what looks like a superficial skin rash that forms a ring around otherwise normal-looking skin. It is a highly uncomfortable and itchy rash.In the case of the first patient, the 28-year-old woman seemed to develop the rash in the summer of 2021. She went to see a dermatologist in December and said she had not traveled internationally, nor had she any known exposures to someone with a similar rash.The report says the woman had “large annular, scaly, pruritic plaques” over her neck, stomach, pubic region and buttocks. Doctors put her on an oral therapy that she started taking in January 2022.When the rash did not improve after two weeks of terbinafine, a common antifungal, doctors put her on itraconazole, a liquid medicine that’s typically used to treat yeast infections in the mouth and throat. It seemed to work, and the infection cleared up after the woman took the medication for four weeks. Doctors are still monitoring her, because ringworm infections can return.The second patient, a 47-year-old woman, developed the rash on her thighs and buttocks while visiting Bangladesh in the summer of 2022. Doctors there treated her with a topical antifungal and steroid creams, but the rash did not seem to clear up. Several other family members in Bangladesh also developed similar rashes.In the fall, when the woman was back in the US, she went to the emergency room three times for help. Doctors gave her several creams and treatments typically used for ringworm, but by December, dermatologists noted that there was no improvement.She was also given oral terbinafine, but her symptoms didn’t improve. Things got better after she was treated with a four-week course of griseofulvin, a medication also often used to treat athlete’s foot and fungal infections on the scalp, but doctors are looking into other treatment options. Her son and husband, who live with her, are undergoing evaluation for similar infections.Dr. Priya Soni, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said it’s impressive that physicians were able to get the species identified with the help of their public health department.Because one of the patients had no history of travel to any area that has seen cases, she said, it’s a real signal that there’s been some epidemiological changes within the fungal species.“It may also be a little more widespread than we have noted before, so for physicians and other providers, I think it’s important to be aware that we may be seeing more of this particular species as we go into the warmer, moist summer months,” said Soni, who was not involved with either new case. “I think with globalization and just the travel that we’re going to see over the summer, this may be something that we may see more of as the months go on.”The report encourages providers to be on the lookout for these infections. Soni said one red flag would probably be if someone with a rash does not respond to terbinafine after about four weeks of treatment.The CDC urges health-care providers to contact their state or local public health department if a rash does not respond to first-line treatments so the cases can be further tested; it notes that testing techniques used by most clinical labs typically misidentify cases of this ringworm as other types.Although itraconazole seemed to work when the first-line treatments didn’t, it can be difficult to absorb and doesn’t always interact well with other medications. It can also take up to 12 weeks to work.“Antimicrobial stewardship efforts are essential to minimize the misuse and overuse of prescribed and over-the-counter antifungal drugs and corticosteroids,” the report says.The CDC also encourages doctors to educate patients about how to prevent the spread of ringworm.Soni said she would advise people to not share clothes, combs or hats with people who have a rash and to avoid close contact with those who have ringworm.Because fungi like warm, moist environments, dry your feet well between taking a shower and putting on socks and shoes.Good hand hygiene can also help, since the fungal infection is spread skin to skin. The fungus can be found in soil, so it’s important to wear gloves or wash hands well after gardening or digging in the dirt.People can get ringworm after petting a farm animal or even a dog or cat that has an infection.“Any kind of ringworm really flourishes in the warm, moist weather, especially in locker rooms, indoor pools, that kind of thing,” Soni said.With the world growing warmer and wetter, scientists say we’ll probably see more fungal infections like this. The concern, of course, will be that even more will be resistant to mainstay treatments.“We run into a little bit of a problem when you see new species that are intrinsically resistant to some of our more common antifungals,” Soni said.",health,0.0

In 2022, an outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus originated in Africa and is the cousin of the smallpox virus.In November 2022, WHO renames the monkeypox virus as mpox after working with International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to rename the the virus using non-stigmatizing, non-offensive social and cultural nomenclature.(Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Mpox is a poxvirus. It generally causes pimple- or blister-like lesions and flu-like symptoms such as fever. The disease is rarely fatal.Mpox spreads through close contact. This includes direct physical contact with lesions as well as “respiratory secretions” shared through face-to-face interaction and touching objects that have been contaminated by mpox lesions or fluids. The virus may also pass to a fetus through the placenta.Anyone can become ill from mpox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that more than 99% of mpox cases in the United States in the 2022 outbreak have been among men who have sex with men. However, mpox is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease.Mpox is usually found in West and Central Africa, but additional cases have been seen in Europe, including the United Kingdom, and other parts of the world in recent years. Those cases are typically linked to international travel or imported animals infected with the poxvirus.CDC Mpox Map and Case CountWHO Situation Reports1958 - Mpox is discovered when monkeys kept for research cause two outbreaks in Copenhagen, Denmark.1970 - The first human case is recorded in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo).2003 - An outbreak in the United States is linked to infected pet prairie dogs imported from Ghana and results in more than 80 cases.July 16, 2021 - The CDC and local health officials in Dallas announce they are investigating a case of mpox in a traveler from Nigeria. “The individual is a City of Dallas resident who traveled from Nigeria to Dallas, arriving at Love Field airport on July 9, 2021. The person is hospitalized in Dallas and is in stable condition,” the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services says in a statement.May 17, 2022 - The first confirmed US case of mpox in the 2022 outbreak is reported to the CDC in a traveler who returned to Massachusetts from Canada.May 19, 2022 - WHO reports that death rates of the outbreak have been between 3% and 6%.May 23, 2022 - The CDC announces the release of mpox vaccine doses from the nation’s Strategic National Stockpile for “high-risk people.” In the United States, the two-dose Jynneos vaccine is licensed to prevent smallpox and specifically to prevent mpox.May 26, 2022 - CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky announces that the United States is distributing the vaccine to states with reported cases and recommends vaccination for people at highest risk of infection due to direct contact with someone who has mpox.June 22, 2022 - The CDC announces a partnership with five commercial laboratories to ramp up testing capacity in the United States.June 23, 2022 - New York City launches the first mpox vaccination clinic in the United States.June 28, 2022 - The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Biden administration announce an enhanced vaccination strategy and report that more than 9,000 doses of vaccine have been distributed to date.July 22, 2022 - Two American children contract mpox – a first in the United States. According to the CDC, the two cases are unrelated.July 23, 2022 - WHO declares mpox a public health emergency of international concern, “an extraordinary event that may constitute a public health risk to other countries through international spread of disease and may require an international coordinated response.”July 27, 2022 - After weeks of mpox vaccines being in limited supply, more than 786,000 additional doses are made available in the United States, according to HHS.July 29, 2022 - New York declares a state disaster emergency in response to the mpox outbreak.August 1, 2022 - California and Illinois declare states of emergency.

A new report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows signs of improvement, but poor mental health remains a “substantial public health problem,” especially among teen girls.CDC researchers tracked average weekly emergency department visits among adolescents ages 12 to 17 for nine specific mental health conditions, suicide attempts and other suicide-related behaviors and drug overdoses.By the fall of 2022, emergency department visits for mental health conditions overall, suicide-related behaviors and drug overdoses were each at least 10% lower than they were in the fall of 2021, on average.Despite the decline, however, emergency department visits for mental and behavioral health remained at or higher than pre-pandemic baseline levels for teen girls.And rates remained significantly higher among adolescent girls compared with adolescent boys. In the fall of 2022, there were more than 4,000 visits for mental health conditions among teen girls, compared with about 2,400 among teen boys. Suspected suicide attempts were nearly four times higher among teen girls than teen boys.Emergency department visits for drug overdoses were also higher than baseline levels from 2019. Overdoses involving opioids in particular increased 27% between fall of 2021 and fall of 2022, with greater increases among teen boys, according to the CDC report.Health experts have been sounding the alarm about youth mental health for years. The CDC released a survey in February that showed teen girls were experiencing record high levels of violence, sadness and suicide risk in recent years.“America’s teen girls are engulfed in a growing wave of sadness, violence and trauma,” Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science, said at the time. However, she said, many mental health challenges are preventable.A return to school and other community settings that were more similar to pre-pandemic environments may have helped adolescents feel less isolated and more engaged, CDC researchers said in the new report.But ongoing efforts to support the mental health of adolescents are necessary, including “evidence-based, comprehensive prevention efforts” such as the 988 suicide crisis line and access to telehealth options, as well as “early condition identification and trauma-informed interventions.”",health,0.0

Each country, in turn, declares its own public health emergency – declarations that carry legal weight. Countries use them to marshal resources and waive rules in order to ease a crisis.After a heated meeting this week, WHO’s emergency committee for mpox recommended an end to the emergency, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus agreed with its assessment.“Yesterday, the emergency committee for mpox met and recommended to me that the multi-country outbreak of mpox no longer represents a public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted that advice and I’m pleased to declare that the mpox is no longer a global health emergency,” Tedros said. “However, as with Covid-19, that does not mean that the work is over. Mpox continues to pose significant public health challenges that need a robust, proactive and sustainable response.”The director-general urged countries to maintain their testing capacity and ability to respond to future outbreaks quickly.From January 2022 through April 2023, more than 87,000 confirmed cases of mpox, including 140 deaths, were reported to WHO from 111 countries or territories. More than 30,000 cases have been reported in the United States. Globally, cases have been declining for months, especially as awareness has increased and a vaccine became more widely available.Tedros said there were 90% fewer cases reported over the last three months compared to the previous 90 days.Dr. Nicola Low, co-chair of the International Health Regulations emergency committee on mpox, said that despite the number of cases falling, transmission continues to circulate.“So, there’s understandable uncertainty about the probability of a large resurgence of infection. There are also gaps in knowledge, which we acknowledge including about modes of transmission in some countries, about the effectiveness of vaccines, and continued lack of effective countermeasures, particularly in African countries where transmission and mpox cases occur regularly,” she said.As a result, Low said, the committee’s move to recommend lifting the public health emergency came “after intense deliberations and discussions,” but the committee determined that the challenges were best solved through a long-term approach rather than through emergency measures.Mpox is a less severe cousin of the now-eradicated smallpox virus. It is endemic to parts of West and Central Africa and has typically been contracted from a rodent or small mammal.In the recent outbreak, gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men have made up the majority of cases, although anyone with close, personal contact with someone with mpox is at risk.“While stigma has been a driving concern in managing this epidemic and continues to hamper access to care for mpox, the feared backlash against the most affected communities has largely not materialized. For that, we’re thankful,” Tedros said.The virus can spread through contact with body fluids, sores or items such as clothing and bedding contaminated with the virus. It can also spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, typically in a close setting.Tedros said that even though the global health emergencies of mpox and Covid-19 are now both over, the possibility of a resurgence lingers.“Both viruses continue to circulate and both continue to kill,” he said.",health,0.0
513,537,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/health/sleep-apnea-brain-damage-study-wellness/index.html,"Sleep apnea, lack of deep sleep linked to damage in brain, study says",2023-05-10 17:02:00,"Uncontrolled sleep apnea — a disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time multiple times a night — may harm future brain health, a new study found.It’s estimated 936 million adults worldwide between the ages of 30 and 69 may suffer from sleep apnea, with many more people undiagnosed. If the sleep apnea is severe and untreated, people have three times the risk of dying from any cause.People with severe sleep apnea who spent less time in deep, also known as slow-wave sleep, had more damage to the white matter of the brain than people who had more slow-wave sleep, according to the study.White matter is the tissue that forms connections between brain cells and the rest of the nervous system. When the brain is scanned, small white spots, called white matter hyperintensities, show the extent of the damage.For every 10% decrease in time spent in deep sleep, there was an increase of white matter hyperintensities in the brain similar to the effect of being 2.3 years older, said study coauthor Dr. Diego Carvalho, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.“The association with sleep apnea was only unveiled when we isolated severe cases, suggesting that mild to moderate sleep apnea may not be significantly associated with white matter changes,” he said.However, no treatment exists for such changes in the brain, “so we need to find ways to prevent them from happening or getting worse.” Carvalho said.Having more white matter hyperintensities can slow the brain’s ability to process information, pay attention and remember, experts say. Lower levels of white matter have also been connected to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and irritability.“Their findings are consistent with the literature that indicates sleep, including slow-wave sleep, plays an important role in maintaining brain health,” said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.“We have also seen associations between poor sleep quality and higher blood pressure, and high blood pressure can lead to brain lesions or stroke,” said Knutson, who was not involved in the new research.The study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, looked at 140 people with an average age of 72 participating in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. All were without dementia and cognitively unimpaired during testing and had undergone one of two types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.About 34% of the participants had mild sleep apnea, 32% had moderate and 34% had severe sleep apnea. With sleep apnea, oxygen drops, and carbon dioxide levels, blood pressure and heart rate rise, Carvalho said.“All these changes lead to increase in inflammation in the body and brain, activation of stress hormones that will raise our blood pressure and affect our metabolism, blood may get thicker,” he said. “Changes in the blood vessels can lead to stroke and poor blood supply to the brain can cause neuronal death or impairment of white matter, which can ultimately contribute to cognitive decline.”The study looked at two biomarkers for damage in the brain: an increase in white matter hyperintensities and changes in fractional anisotropy of the genu of the corpus callosum (genu FA), which measures the movement of water inside fibers that connect neurons in the brain.“Changes in the movement of the water in axons are related to problems in their integrity suggesting damage to its structure,” Carvalho said. “We used this measure to investigate early white matter abnormalities associated with vascular disease.”Dementia caused by vascular disease is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, experts say.After factoring out conditions that could impact brain changes, such as age, high blood pressure and cholesterol, the study found each drop of 10% in slow-wave sleep was equivalent to three years of aging as measured by genu FA, Carvalho said.The examination of white matter hyperintensities showed similar results, Carvalho said. The brain of a patient who had only 5% of their total sleep during the study in slow-wave or deep sleep looked 4.6 years older in terms of white matter abnormality compared to a patient who had 25% of their sleep in slow-wave sleep, he said.Some degree of white matter damage is typical in midlife, due to repeated exposure to environmental challenges such as pollution, stress and cardiovascular issues, to name a few.  A 2019 study, for example, found white matter hyperintensities in the brains of 45-year-olds.Such changes in white matter have been associated with increased risk for cognitive decline as well as Alzheimer’s disease and related types of dementia. However, having white matter damage does not guarantee serious mental decline, said Alzheimer’s disease researcher Dr. Richard Isaacson, a preventive neurologist at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases of Florida.“Having white matter disease isn’t a ‘good’ thing, but how clinically meaningful it is is hard to judge — generally speaking less is more, but that doesn’t always translate into clinical symptoms,” said Isaacson, who was not involved in the new study.In addition, the study could only show an association, not causation, so further studies are needed to understand the relationship between sleep apnea and changes to the brain, Knutson said.“It may be that a lower percent of slow-wave sleep is a consequence of fragmented sleep, particularly due to the obstructive sleep apnea, or it may be that slow-wave sleep itself is important for cardiovascular and brain health,” she said.During the first and second stages of sleep, the body starts to decrease its rhythms. Doing so leads to the third stage — a slow-wave or deep sleep where the body is literally restoring itself on a cellular level — fixing damage from the day’s wear and tear and consolidating memories into long-term storage.Years of research has found sleep, especially the deepest and most healing kind, boosts immune functioning. Slow-wave sleep is also the time when the body “takes out the trash” in the brain, Isaacson said, including beta amyloid, one of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer’s.Deep sleep is considered one of the best markers of sleep quality, because a person must typically have relatively uninterrupted sleep to achieve it. Since each sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes long, most adults need seven to eight hours of relatively uninterrupted slumber to achieve restorative sleep, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People with sleep apnea, however, can have dozens of micro-awakenings during the night as they snore, snort or gasp for breath.

Do they work?,2023-05-09 19:01:00,"Around one-third of people globally live with chronic pain — pain experienced for more than three months — and millions of people are prescribed antidepressants to relieve the condition.However, a new review of prior research published Tuesday has found that most antidepressants used to relieve chronic pain are being prescribed without sufficient reliable evidence of their effectiveness. What’s more, potential harms haven’t been well studied.A two-year study by the nonprofit group Cochrane found that only one antidepressant, duloxetine, was effective for short-term pain relief based on the available evidence. Cochrane is an international collaboration of researchers that produces the Cochrane Library, which includes a database of systematic summaries addressing key questions in health care.Sold under the brand names Irenka and Cymbalta, duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or SNRI, and also boosts levels of the feel-good neurochemical dopamine.“This is a global public health concern,” said lead author Tamar Pincus, a professor and chronic pain researcher at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom.“Chronic pain is a problem for millions who are prescribed antidepressants without sufficient scientific proof they help, nor an understanding of the long-term impact on health.”The review included 176 studies with a total of 28,664 participants and looked at 25 different antidepressants. The studies mainly investigated three types of chronic pain: fibromyalgia, nerve pain and musculoskeletal pain.The average length of the study was 10 weeks, and the studies were randomized controlled trials — regarded as the gold standard in medical research. Seventy-two of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies.The most commonly prescribed antidepressant for chronic pain globally was amitriptyline, the study said. Sold in the United States under the brand names Elavil and Vanatrip, the antidepressant was approved in 1961 by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in adults. The medication has significant side effects, so it is not commonly used for depression, but is prescribed to treat migraines and chronic pain such as diabetic neuropathy.However, the authors found most of the studies on amitriptyline’s effectiveness were small and the evidence was not reliable.Milnacipran, which is approved by the FDA for fibromyalgia, was also effective at reducing pain, the review found, but the scientists were not as confident about this drug compared with duloxetine due to limited studies with few people.Anyone taking antidepressants for chronic pain relief should speak to their doctor before stopping their medication due to concerns over the new report, the authors stressed.Antidepressants are thought to help with pain because the bodily systems that regulate mood and pain overlap, explained Ryan Patel, a research fellow studying chronic pain at the Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases at King’s College London.He said the key question for researchers to answer was not whether antidepressant drugs were effective for treating pain but “for whom are antidepressants effective?”“Even when the cause of chronic pain is the same, the biological changes that occur in the nervous system are varied and so it is no surprise that pain presents differently from person to person, and not everyone will respond to the same drugs,” said Patel, who wasn’t involved in the review.“What this comprehensive analysis demonstrates is that when clinical trials are designed poorly under the assumption that everyone’s experience of pain is uniform, most antidepressants appear to have limited use for treating chronic pain,” Patel added in a statement.Even for the antidepressant duloxetine, there was no research looking at long-term use of the drug, the review found.“Though we did find that duloxetine provided short-term pain relief for patients we studied, we remain concerned about its possible long-term harm due to the gaps in current evidence,” Pincus said.The report said future research should address any unwanted effects of using antidepressants for chronic pain, noting that the existing data on this was “poor.”“It (duloxetine) does look really good at the moment for short term pain relief, but I want to emphasize that patients aren’t prescribed duloxetine or any antidepressant for three weeks, four weeks, six weeks, they’re prescribed it for six months. So it’s really shocking that we don’t have any evidence for long term use of even duloxetine,” Pincus said.Dr. Cathy Stannard, the clinical lead for the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for chronic pain, and a pain specialist for NHS Gloucestershire’s Integrated Care Board in the UK, said that it was important to emphasize the social and psychological influences on how people experience pain and the importance of a patient’s relationship with their doctor.“There is good evidence that for people with pain, compassionate and consistent relationships with clinicians remain the foundations of successful care,” Stannard, who wasn’t involved in the research, said in a statement.“Research shows that what people want most is a strong, empathic relationship with their care provider. They want time to discuss what matters to them and they want easy access to support and to be partners in their care.”Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as support with mobility, debt management, trauma and social isolation, were also likely to help people living with pain, she added.",health,0.0
517,541,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/world/may-flower-moon-lunar-eclipse-aquariids-meteor-shower-scn/index.html,"How to view a lunar eclipse, full ‘flower moon,’ and meteor shower this weekend",2023-05-05 11:23:00,"With bright meteors blazing across the sky from the Aquariids meteor shower and a chance to see a lunar eclipse, Friday will be the time to look up to the sky for a day of spectacular celestial events.Anyone venturing out to spot a meteor with this year’s Aquariids show could see up to 20 meteors per hour, but you’ll have to be up early — the best times to try to see a meteor will be just before dawn on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. The event’s estimated peak time is at 11 a.m. ET Saturday.Alongside the shower comes the May flower moon, the first full moon of the “month of flower,” and its almost perfect alignment with the sun and Earth. That alignment will create what is known as a penumbral lunar eclipse, which is when the moon enters Earth’s outer shadow. This event will be between 11:13 a.m. and 3:31 p.m. ET Friday but won’t be visible in the Americas because the moon isn’t up then. But it will cause a dimming of the lunar surface for those in Africa, Asia and Australia.The collision of celestial events might be exciting for space enthusiasts, but together they could hinder your view. With the moon completely full, the Aquariids will have to compete with some bright light interference to be seen in the night sky.“I would suggest going out around 3 o’clock in the morning. Get a lawn chair and put the moon at your back,” said Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. “Look for these fast meteors shooting upward from the eastern horizon. Not all meteors you see will be Eta Aquariids, but they’re easy to tell because the Eta Aquariids are very fast.”During an eclipse, the shadow Earth casts is broken up into two sections: the umbra, which is the dark center, and the penumbra, the fainter outer shadow. During a penumbral eclipse, the moon stays on this outer ring, appearing as if it is dimming, but not completely darkening like a total lunar eclipse.“The moon passes through the portion of the Earth’s shadow, and because it grazes the shadow it’s not quite as much distance as when it passes through the entire shadow of the Earth,” said Noah Petro, chief of NASA’s Planetary Geology, Geophysics and Geochemistry Lab, noting that it will be hard for someone to see. “The dimming of the moon is very slight, but if someone is in a dark place, they may notice the full moon is not quite as bright as normal.”Still, Petro encouraged people in Asia and Australia to get out and see the lunar eclipse.“Any chance people have to get out and look at the moon is an excellent opportunity to connect with our moon. Eclipses (penumbral or total) are great excuses to take a look at the moon and start looking at it more regularly!”Every annual meteor shower has a radiant, the constellation from which the meteors appear to be originating. The Aquariids constellation is Aquarius, hence the shower’s name, and lies on the ecliptic, the sun’s path in the sky.The Aquariids are only visible just before dawn since the radiant rises a few hours before the sun does, limiting the evening hours in which you can see them.Those in northern areas, such as Canada, will have a smaller window to see activity, the American Meteor Society’s Lunsford said, while those in the Southern Hemisphere will have a slightly longer time frame where the radiant will be up, and the sun will still be down.The Aquariids typically produce meteors that are faster than others, including the last event of the Lyrids in April, which means they tend to produce more persistent trains, smoke trails caused by disintegration of the blazing fast meteors. A meteor’s speed is determined by the angle in which it encounters Earth, with the Aquariids mostly colliding with the atmosphere head-on, Lunsford said.Lunsford also mentioned that this year’s peak is expected to see slightly more meteors per hour, and next year even more so due to perturbation that has caused the debris trail to move closer to Earth. In 2024, Lunsford estimates that those within the Southern Tropics could see a range of 75 to 100 meteors per hour.“You don’t need expensive equipment; it is a way that you can participate in astronomy without spending a lot of money, and it’s fun,” Lunsford said. “You can actually make useful scientific contributions by counting the number of meteors you see and trying to separate them into Lyrids or non-Lyrids.“Besides, it’s like having an early Fourth of July celebration … to see a shooting star. And, who knows, you can make a whole lot of wishes if you see a bunch.”The Eta Aquariids will be hanging around until May 27, but if you missed their peak, there are plenty more opportunities to spot a meteor.Here are the remaining meteor showers of 2023 and their peak dates:• Southern Delta Aquariids: July 30-31• Alpha Capricornids: July 30-31• Perseids: August 12-13• Orionids: October 20-21• Southern Taurids: November 4-5• Northern Taurids: November 11-12• Leonids: November 17-18• Geminids: December 13-14• Ursids: December 21-22The penumbral lunar eclipse event is only viewable to those in certain parts of the world, but there are other chances to see an eclipse in your area:If you live in North, Central or South America, an annular solar eclipse will take place on October 14, when the moon moves in front of the Earth’s view of the sun, creating a crisp, fiery circle in the sky.On October 28, a partial lunar eclipse will be viewable in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America.This year will have 13 full moons, with two in August. Here’s the list of full moons remaining in 2023, according to the Farmers’ Almanac:• June 3: Strawberry moon• July 3: Buck moon• August 1: Sturgeon moon• August 30: Blue moon• September 29: Harvest moon• October 28: Hunter’s moon• November 27: Beaver moon• December 26: Cold moon",travel,0.0
519,543,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/health/job-sleep-problems-wellness/index.html,"Is your job ruining your sleep? If so, this may be why",2023-05-09 11:00:00,"Sleeping poorly due to job stress? That may be due to a lack of support from coworkers and higher-ups, a new study found.However, receiving improved psychological and social support at your job allows you to more easily shut off from the workday, thus giving you precious downtime to de-stress and improve sleep, according to the study.“This study highlights the important role that workplace environment and stress have beyond the setting of work on overall well-being,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Zee was not involved in the study.“Initiatives to improve well-being in the workplace can improve sleep, but at a personal level, what we can optimize is our sleep quality — which in turn can help to handle stress and ultimately increase resilience to daily challenges we face,” Zee said.The study, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, analyzed data on nearly 115,000 participants in the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health, the Work Environment and Health in Denmark study, and the Finnish Public Sector Study, who were followed for up to six years.Researchers looked at top-down resources — leadership qualities, such as appreciation and the ability to listen, and procedural justice, which is the perception of fairness in the workplace — and horizontal resources, such as support from coworkers and a collaborative culture. Collaboration was defined as working closely with others to achieve the best available results or to develop or apply new ideas.Sleep problems included initiating or maintaining sleep, poor-quality sleep and daytime tiredness two to four times a week that lasted one month to three months. Confounding factors, such as age and preexisting physical or mental disorders, were factored out.Within a two-year period of time, over half of the participants (53%) reported changes in their workplace environment. If changes were positive in either of the two categories — leadership and fairness or coworker support and collaboration — the odds of persistent sleep problems declined. The biggest decline occurred when a person saw improvements in all four areas at the workplace.However, if the changes at work were negative, sleep issues increased — in fact 1 in 4 people in the study with a worse job environment developed problems getting enough rest.“Our findings justify future intervention studies to examine the extent to which improvements in workplace psychosocial resources could facilitate remission or recovery from sleep disturbances and prevent development, deterioration, or prolongation of sleep disturbances among employees,” wrote corresponding author Tianwei Xu, a postdoctoral student in epidemiology at Stockholm University in Sweden.Having negative changes in the leadership and fairness sector was associated with the greatest long-term impact on sleep, more than negative changes in coworker relationships or collaboration, the study found.“This finding is plausible, considering the greater power of leaders to affect a positive working environment,” Xu and her coauthors wrote.Once the bed and bedroom have become associated with bad slumber, anxiety can increase just by entering the room where sleep is elusive, experts say. Bad sleep habits, such as eating, working, watching TV and worrying in bed can solidify that negative association.Stimulus control therapy can help overcome the connection between wakefulness and the bedroom by training the mind to see the bed and bedroom as a place for good sleep, while eliminating cues for activities that interfere with falling asleep.Can’t fall asleep? One of the first things to do: Get up if you haven’t fallen asleep within 15 or 20 minutes, experts say. Keep the lights dim and stay away from blue light emitted by electronics — watching TV or using a smartphone or computer will only send the brain a signal that it’s time to wake up. Do something mindless, like folding socks, until you feel sleepy. Only then can you go back to bed.Mind racing from work worries? Whatever you do, don’t worry in bed, said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.“Schedule a ‘worry time’ — a period of time outside of the bedroom, outside of sleep, to worry about the things that naturally creep in your mind at night,” said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study.Sleep researcher Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, vice chair for research in the George Washington University department of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, gave CNN this advice in a previous interview: “Write down a list of things you need to do tomorrow. You can even email it to yourself.”Deep breathing is a science-backed way to calm both body and mind. By changing the rhythm of your breath you slow your heart rate, reduce blood pressure and stimulate your body’s parasympathetic “rest and digest” system. One of the most popular deep breathing techniques, the 4-7-8 technique, can easily be done before you turn out the light. Try the relaxation exercise again if you wake during the middle of the night.Another proven technique is progressive muscle relaxation, experts say. Tightly tense muscles in various areas of the body for 10 seconds while breathing in. Strive to squeeze each muscle hard, but not to the point of cramping or pain. Then, as you breathe out, relax the muscle suddenly and all at once. University of Michigan Health recommends you do the exercises in a systematic order of the body from head to toe.",health,0.0
521,545,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/30/health/hangover-prevention-wellness/index.html,How to prevent a hangover,2023-05-05 06:52:00,"You had a little too much to drink last night, and now you’re nursing that dreaded morning aftermath — a hangover.What seemed like great fun at the time is now causing your hands to shake, your head to pound and your heart to race, not to mention other unpleasant symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity and excruciating thirst.Why are you suffering? Because the liquor that smoothly passed your lips is now wreaking havoc in your body, causing dehydration, stomach distress and inflammation. These ailments peak about the time all the alcohol leaves your body.There is no scientifically proven way to cure a hangover, but experts say you can prevent one — or at least keep that morning-after misery to a minimum. Here’s how.Forget a late-night meal after a night of drinking — that’s much too late, experts say. Instead, eat before your first drink and keep noshing as the night goes on.“Food in the stomach slows gastric emptying and can reduce hangover symptoms,” said Dr. Robert Swift, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island.Why does food help? Because most alcohol isn’t absorbed by an empty stomach but via the intestinal tract just below it, Swift said.“If somebody does shots on an empty stomach, for example, all that pure alcohol is not diluted by the stomach and is passed to the intestine very quickly,” said Swift, who has studied alcohol abuse since the 1990s.“If the stomach contains food, however, there are gastric juices and enzymes that mix the food and the alcohol, and only small amounts of food are passed into the intestine,” he said. “Now the alcohol is diluted in the stomach, and only a small quantity of alcohol is absorbed at any time.”The same principle applies to water and other nonalcoholic beverages, Swift said. “If alcohol is mixed with fluid, it’s diluted, so when it goes into your intestines, it’s not as irritating. You’re less likely to have inflamed intestines or an inflamed stomach lining.”There’s another benefit to downing water between drinks, said Dr. John Brick, former chief of research at the Center of Alcohol Studies, Education and Training Division at Rutgers University in New Jersey.“The primary cause of hangovers is dehydration and the loss of fluids, along with vitamins and minerals,” said Brick, who authored “The Doctor’s Hangover Handbook” and published scientific papers on the biobehavioral effects of alcohol and other drugs.Downing just 3½ alcoholic drinks can result in the loss of up to a quart of water over several hours, Brick added. “That’s a good amount of water that has to be replenished.”Dehydration from alcohol may affect a woman even more, and she is more likely to suffer a hangover, even if she drinks less than a man, Swift said. That’s because a man has a higher percentage of body water than a woman of the same height and weight, so the same amount of alcohol will be more diluted in a man, he said.“The woman will have a higher concentration of blood alcohol because her body contains less water to dilute it,” he said. “Women are much more susceptible to the deleterious effects of alcohol (and they) get more intoxicated and develop alcohol liver disease sooner in life than men do.”The alcohol we drink, called ethyl alcohol or ethanol, is the byproduct of fermenting carbohydrates and starches, usually some sort of grain, grape or berry. We use byproducts of fermentation in other ways: Ethanol is added to the gasoline in our cars, and methyl alcohol or methanol — a toxic substance — is used as a solvent, pesticide and alternative fuel source. Also called wood alcohol, methyl alcohol made by bootleggers blinded or killed thousands of people during Prohibition.That’s not all — the list of byproducts or chemicals added by manufacturers for flavor and taste can read like a list of supplies at an industrial warehouse: ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, n-propanol, isobutanol, n-butanol, isopentanol and isoamyl alcohols. While these congeners, as they are called, are added in small, nontoxic amounts, some people are overly sensitive to their effects.Overall, dark-colored beer and spirits tend to contain more congeners and thus may be more likely to cause hangovers, experts say. A 2010 study investigated the intensity of hangovers in people who drank the darker-colored liquor bourbon versus clear vodka.“Congeners in bourbon … significantly increased hangover intensity, which is not too surprising since bourbon has about 37 times the amount of congeners as vodka,” Brick said.Chemical preservatives called sulfites, known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive people, are also a natural byproduct of fermentation in small quantities. However, many manufacturers of beer and wine add sulfites to their products to extend shelf life. (Sulfites are also added to soda, cereals, sweeteners, canned and ultraprocessed foods, medications and more.)Sweet and white wines tend to have more sulfites than red, but red wines contain more tannins, which are bitter or astringent compounds found in the skin and seeds of grapes. Like sulfites, tannins can trigger allergic reactions in people who are sensitive.As a result, limiting your drinking to light beers, clear liquors and white wine might help keep hangovers at bay.In the end, however, experts say there is only one true preventive — or cure — for a hangover: Don’t drink.“There’s no simple cure because there are so many complex factors that are producing the multiple symptoms of a hangover,” Swift said. “And that’s why the only real cure for a hangover is to not drink alcohol or drink such a low amount of alcohol that it won’t trigger a hangover.”",health,0.0
526,550,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/health/what-are-zillennials-wellness/index.html,Zillennials: The newest micro-generation has a name,2023-05-10 04:43:00,"There was a time when Juliana Olarte, a 26-year-old travel publicist living in New York City, couldn’t figure out where she fit in from a generational standpoint.Her Generation Z sister, who is 16, sometimes calls Olarte “cheugy,” she said. The term is used by Gen Z to refer to “millennial things that are kind of uncool or cringey,” according to Olarte.“My sister sees me as a young millennial, and millennials see me as Gen Z,” she said.The term millennial (also known as Generation Y) refers to anyone born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z refers to anyone born from 1997 through 2012, according to the Pew Research Center.Along the blurry edge at the cusp of the two generations, between Gen Y and Z, is where zillennials live.“When I first heard the term zillennial, in college, I was like, ‘that’s me,’” Olarte said.Unfamiliar with the term? It’s a tiny group.“Zillennials refer to a small cohort born between the early 1990s and the early 2000s,” said Deborah Carr, professor of sociology and director of the Center for Innovation in Social Science at Boston University. “They’re on the cusp of Gen Z and millennial, thus the mash-up label of zillennial.”This micro-generation, loosely defined as being in their early to mid-20s, have faced and overcome much adversity in their relatively short lives, said Carr via email.“They were babies and children when 9/11 struck and don’t know life before airport security screenings, rampant domestic terrorism and other frightening threats,” she said. “They attended college during the pandemic, and missed out on important social markers.”Zillennials were born roughly between 1992 and 2002, but there isn’t one consistent cut off point that experts agree on, Carr said.Ask a zillennial, though, and they might tell you who they are.Olarte’s sister and other members of “Gen Z grew up with a phone in their hand and with social media — they didn’t miss a beat,” said Olarte. A decade earlier, “we had the iPod Touch to download music online and did YouTube-to-mp3 converters.”The different ways generations grow up with and use technology is a strong delineator in defining generations.Zillennials straddle the generations of millennials, who are considered digital pioneers, and Gen Z, who are considered digital natives who never knew life before screens.“We’ve been growing up with technology our whole lives, but we’re not TikTok dancers like Gen Z but also weren’t on MySpace like millennials,” said Sabrina Grimaldi, 23. She launched Zillennial Zine, a mostly online site for her micro-generation, in 2021.Grimaldi has a younger sibling who is Gen Z and an older sibling who’s a millennial. “My entire life, I’ve been told I’m a millennial or a new Gen Zer. I really do relate to both, but I also don’t at all,” she said.Her website’s most popular articles have covered such topics as what to wear to the Harry Styles and Taylor Swift concerts; “the best cozy Nintendo Switch games;” and recipes inspired by the Utah dirty soda trend on TikTok, which involves pouring creamer into soda, Grimaldi said.Among the celebrities she considers part of her zillennial cohort are Zendaya and American singer-songwriter Sabrina Carpenter.“We are kind of this weird, in-between ground nobody talks about that’s also young and figuring things out, at the beginning of our careers and discovering the world as an adult,” she said. “The most misunderstood thing about us is probably our existence.”In addition to a shared relationship with technology, members of a generation or birth cohort often share critical life experiences, said Carr.For the “Greatest Generation,” that includes being called to serve during World War II, she said. For baby boomers, having grown up together as young adults in the tumultuous 1960s is a commonality. Gen X was born after boomers, from the early 1960s to the late 1970s.Gen Z attended high school during the pandemic and missed out on major youth milestones. For Americans, that might be prom and tradtional graduations.“Some generations reject the labels given to them by others and some generations embrace the name if they feel it fits them and their values or differences,” said Jason Dorsey, a generations researcher and president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, a generational research firm.“We find that zillennials often push away from the negative millennial headlines that they are trying to avoid or not replicate, such as the clickbait stories on acting entitled as adults or having overly high expectations,” he said via email, noting that zillennials also push away from teenagers and teen trends that feel too young.Some millennials, too, shun the label they’ve been given because they believe it has a negative connotation and sells them short, Dorsey said.“In fact, contrary to many popular memes of millennials not working, they are often the largest generation in a company’s workforce and frequently the largest generations of managers,” he said.While zillennials often feel they don’t fit in with either Gen Z or millennials, Dorsey said the middle zone they occupy has its own advantages.“At our research center, we’ve seen cuspers like zillennials often end up having an advantage because it tends to make them more aware of both generations before and after their own,” he said.His firm’s research has shown Gen Z to be more connected to social causes than millennials, with zillennials similarly more interested than millennials when it comes to social issues.People in Gen Z “care a lot about environmentalism, trying to reduce their carbon footprints and reduce their plastic waste.” Grimaldi said.From a young age, zillennials have learned the effects of climate change, said Carr. “They are very mindful of the threats to the planet—yet also know they can play an important role in reducing their carbon footprint (Think, Greta Thunberg),” Carr said.But the stereotypes society creates for generations are just stereotypes, Carr said.“We need to remember that every generation of young people has their own struggles and that they’re coping the best they can with the world that past generations have created for them,” she said.Philip Cohen, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, calls generational labels meaningless.“Marketers and fadfluencers will want to be the first to name a ‘generation’ or ‘microgeneration’ for clicks and followers,” Cohen wrote via email. “But it is meaningless to do so before we know what it is we’re studying and why.”“Social science does not pay much attention to the discourse over ‘generations’ because it is mostly superficial hype,” he said.Try telling that to a zillennial, however.Grimaldi thinks it’s up to every generation to band together to support the next group of people growing up in society after it — all the better to help ensure a brighter future for all. And her generation, she said, is already on it.“Every time a new generation pops up there’s this argument about who sucks and why they suck, and I think as zillennials we are trying to stop that as much as we can,” said Grimaldi. “We don’t have to hate on every new upcoming generation.“We’re all collectively raising these new generations,” she said. “Let’s focus on building a better future together.”",style,0.0

Traces of the virus that causes Covid-19 can be detected in people’s feces when they are infected, even if they don’t have symptoms.The airport announced Tuesday that the CDC’s partner Concentric by Ginkgo, the biosecurity and public health unit of Boston-based synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks, has installed an automatic device that will regularly collect wastewater samples from various international flights arriving at SFO. Those combined samples of wastewater then will be sent to laboratories for testing.“As we know from the COVID-19 pandemic, pathogens can spread quickly across the globe, impacting travel and trade,” Dr. Cindy Friedman, chief of the CDC’s Travelers’ Health Branch, said in a news release Tuesday. “Testing of airplane wastewater can provide early detection of new COVID-19 variants and other pathogens that can cause outbreaks and pandemics. CDC appreciates the collaboration with SFO to further enhance these efforts.”SFO will be the first airport to launch this pilot program with the CDC, Airport Director Ivar Satero said in the announcement. The airport also has been involved in supplying wastewater samples to the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center to help identify emerging coronavirus variants, but those samples were taken from the airport’s wastewater treatment plant.Testing aircraft wastewater involves collecting sewage from individual commercial passenger planes.“You can pull it off the airplane in under two minutes, quickly put it into a lab network, which we manage all of that,” Matt McKnight, general manager at Ginkgo Bioworks, told CNN in January.Once those wastewater samples arrive at a diagnostic lab for testing, scientists scan them for traces of known or unknown viruses, such as emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. When samples test positive for the virus, scientists conduct genome sequencing – which usually takes about five to seven days – to identify exactly which variant that virus is. Then, scientists may analyze their results and submit their findings to the CDC.Monitoring sewage for traces of coronavirus variants is a “validated” scientific process – no longer in its pilot phase – and airplanes are a logical next step, McKnight said.The United States’ declaration of a public health emergency due to Covid-19 is set to end Thursday, but White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said that it will continue to be important to monitor wastewater for emerging variants.“If you think about what data is really valuable today, wastewater surveillance is really the best way to assess infections in the community,” Jha said, noting that test positivity no longer presents as fulsome of a picture “because people just aren’t testing as much” due to the relaxing of testing requirements and a rise in testing fatigue, among other factors.“So, when I look at data every day on trying to assess where we are with infections, I look at wastewater data. That continues. That will continue, and wastewater now covers the majority of Americans,” he said. “When I’m trying to assess severity of illness … it’s hospitalizations and deaths.”McKnight said in a statement Tuesday that even though the public health emergency declaration is ending, “we must continue to leverage the biosecurity tools developed and scaled up over the past few years to keep track of the evolution of the virus and other emerging pathogens.

In the new report, researchers examined the exposure that some of the survey’s participants had to gun violence from 1995 to 2021.Researchers from Harvard University, the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford analyzed the answers of 2,418 participants – including Black, Hispanic and White people who were born in 1981, 1984 and 1996 – and found that witnessing or becoming a victim of gun violence varied by race or ethnicity and age.By the time the participants turned 40, about 56% of Black respondents and nearly 55% of Latinos said they had seen someone else get shot, compared with nearly 26% of White respondents, the report says.While only 6.4% of all respondents said they had been shot by age 40, the report shows a disparity among the racial and ethnic groups. About 7% of Black and Latino participants said they had been shot, compared with 3.1% of White participants.Researchers said changes in society were key factors on whether and at what stage a person was exposed to gun violence. Those who were born in 1987, they said, had the lowest incidence of being shot because they were teenagers when gun violence was “at its lowest point in the past 3 decades.”The findings may not be representative of the entire country as they are centered in the experiences of people in Chicago, the report says, but violence rates and trends in the city – America’s third largest – may be parallel to those in other major cities.The report does not offer details on the consequences of gun violence exposure, but a commentary by Dr. Jonathan Jay that was published Tuesday along with the new study says exposure to it has lasting impacts for youths and their loved ones.Indirect or direct exposure “can influence mental and physical health outcomes over the life course” and “it is crucial to continue scaling up public health programs to halt the violence surge and deal with its aftermath, especially through community-based outreach programs and trauma-informed services,” said Jay, an assistant professor of community health sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health who was not involved In the new research.",health,0.0
529,553,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/health/veterans-ptsd-psychedelics-wwii-wellness/index.html,My grandfather hid the emotional toll of World War II from his family for decades,2023-05-09 13:16:00,"For decades after returning home from World War II, my grandfather did not talk about his wartime experiences.Frank Murphy flew 21 perilous missions as a navigator of a B-17 for the Eighth Air Force’s 100th Bomb Group, nicknamed “the Bloody Hundredth.” The day his plane was shot down in 1943, two of the men in his crew died, and my grandfather considered himself lucky to have parachuted out of his burning aircraft and be captured by the Nazis.For the next 18 months, he would endure deplorable conditions as a German prisoner of war, take part in a harrowing death march in subzero temperatures and by the time US Gen. George S. Patton’s troops liberated him, he had lost over 50 pounds and was riddled with dysentery, pneumonia and lice.Everyone could see the physical toll of war on his body, but we didn’t know about his invisible wounds.That is until 2001, more than 50 years after returning home, when my grandfather wrote a memoir, “Luck of the Draw: My Story of the Air War in Europe,” for our family. He originally self-published the book for our family but as I got older, I felt his story needed to reach a wider audience. After several years of gathering his original materials and photographs, I partnered with St. Martin’s Press to release the book in February and it is now a New York Times bestseller.In his book, he wrote, “I often wonder why Providence allowed me to survive when so many others did not.”My mother and his other three children said that their dad never spoke about the war during their childhood. It wasn’t until my mom read his book that she truly knew what he had gone through.Even my grandmother Ann, his wife of 50 years, told me that she did not even know that her soon-to-be-husband had been a prisoner of war until right before they were married.Researching my grandfather’s time during the war, I’ve often wondered if he had post-traumatic stress disorder. I may never know whether he had PTSD or not — but in the 78 years since World War II ended, it’s so vital that the national conversation around this important topic is moving forward.It’s had different names throughout history. After World War I, it was “shell shock”; post-World War II it was known as “combat fatigue,” and after Vietnam it was called “post-Vietnam syndrome.” In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association officially recognized it as post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.Post-traumatic stress disorder “is a psychiatric disorder that may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, series of events or set of circumstances. An individual may experience this as emotionally or physically harmful or life-threatening and may affect mental, physical, social, and/or spiritual well-being,” according to the American Psychiatric Association’s website. “Examples include natural disasters, serious accidents, terrorist acts, war/combat, rape/sexual assault, historical trauma, intimate partner violence and bullying.”Now professionals such as psychologist Shauna Springer and psychiatrist Frank Ochberg are advocating calling it post-traumatic brain injury.“I refer to it as an injury because I’ve seen that there’s a biological component to being exposed to trauma as well as a psychological component that has always been with us,” Springer, chief psychologist at the Stella Center, told me. “And now I think we’re on the cusp of evolving the term further.”Post-traumatic brain injury has always existed, Springer said, and people are finally talking about it.“It’s kind of like saying that because the divorce rate was so much lower in previous generations that everybody had these great marriages,” she said, “but actually that was a factor of how much stigma there was about divorce and how dependent women were financially at that time without their own career options.”Forty percent of medical discharges during WWII were for psychiatric conditions, most for combat stress, according to the National World War II Museum In New Orleans.But veterans didn’t always mention their trauma when they came home from the war.“When your grandfather and my grandfather served in World War II, they didn’t talk about it,” Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told me.“They came home and too often, you know, their therapy was drinking,” he said. “There was a generation of folks who had tremendous trauma and pain, and that overflowed into their families in ways that we still can’t even quantify.”My grandfather was in the infamous Stalag Luft III prison camp, where “The Great Escape” took place. In his memoir, he writes about going to bed hungry, freezing and terrified of never knowing when the war would end.“A prisoner of war experiences real-time feelings of helplessness and you’re on-your-own that cannot be imagined unless you have been there,” my grandpa relates in “Luck of the Draw.”“It is difficult to put into words the sense of powerlessness and vulnerability one experiences when standing completely defenseless before a formidable armed wartime enemy of your country, knowing that the entire might of the United States is of no benefit to you.”I have his book to remind me, but it’s hard to imagine what else he must have gone through, and the struggles he went through alone, once he was back home.With so many US troops fighting abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 20 years, the problems my grandpa faced haven’t gone away.About 16 veterans commit suicide each day in the United States, according to a report by the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Asked for comment by CNN, the VA did not specify how many of those suicides were related to post-traumatic stress.I became active in the fight for our veterans when I joined the board of directors for the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force near Savannah, Georgia, in 2015 in honor of my grandfather’s service.I found allies in the cause when I joined the board, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry, who has been a vocal supporter of our nation’s veterans, was a pilot in the Air Force before entering politics and eventually becoming the US secretary of energy. His father, like my grandfather, served in the Eighth Air during WWII.“My instinct here is warriors are very proud, and showing weakness in any form has historically been frowned upon,” he told me.Perry’s attention to the emotional toll of war became heightened when he met Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell. Luttrell had just returned home from a harrowing experience participating in Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan in 2005. (It went on to become a best-selling book and a 2013 film starring Mark Wahlberg called “Lone Survivor.”)  Perry and his wife took Luttrell into their home and got him the psychological support he needed.At same time, Perry was introduced to Amber and Marcus Capone, a couple who had started an organization called Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, which provides resources, research and advocacy for US military veterans seeking treatment with psychedelic-assisted therapies.They started the group after Marcus Capone returned home from multiple combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and was having suicidal thoughts.“He didn’t understand why he couldn’t get better,” Amber Capone said. “He was trying so hard. I just thought of our kids and them living the rest of their lives without a father and how this would impact generations to come, and I just thought, I can’t stop fighting for him.”Six years later, VETS says it has provided funding for more than 700 veterans to get access to psychedelic treatments at centers outside the country due to issues with legalization.This is one of the reasons Perry has devoted years to supporting veterans and bipartisan legislation for psychedelic therapy for veterans.“I know this whole concept, Rick Perry’s name and psychedelics in the same sentence, five years ago I would’ve kind of looked at you and said, ‘What are you talking about?’ ” Perry told me. “But I know kids that were really sick that are now about as close to normal as you can get.”The legalization of psychedelic treatments varies in the United States. Only a handful of states such as New York, California and Arizona have active legislation proposed to decriminalize plant-based hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms,” and dimethyltryptamine, which is found in some plants used to brew ayahuasca.While Oregon and Colorado are the only two US states to have decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms for those over 21, other states such as Texas and Maryland are conducting clinical trials with MDMA and ibogaine for those suffering from issues such as PTSD and depression.Dr. David Rabin, a neuroscientist and board-certified psychiatrist, has been studying the effects of chronic stress on mental and physical health for nearly 20 years.“We know that hugs feel good. We know that music makes us feel good if we like listening to our favorite songs, right? That is intuitive, but we don’t necessarily remember to breathe when we’re stressed out,” Rabin said.“Psychedelic medicine is interesting because it works when it’s used properly,” he said. “It works as a therapy amplifier because it molecularly seems to do something in the brain that amplifies the neural pathways of safety that are set up by the therapeutic environment.”Springer cofounded the Stella Center, a network of clinics that offer ketamine infusion therapy and dual sympathetic reset for those suffering from post-traumatic stress. Dual sympathetic reset is a procedure involving a local anesthetic injected next to a mass of sympathetic nerves in the neck called the stellate ganglion to help regulate an overactive sympathetic nervous system, according to Stella’s website.“For some, it’s medication; for some, it’s a service dog,” said Rieckhoff of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “And I think everybody’s got to figure out what their right prescription is to meet their unique situation.”Another individual bringing resources to veterans and their families is ABC News journalist Bob Woodruff.While reporting in the field in Iraq in 2006, Woodruff had a near-death experience that changed the course of his life. An improvised explosive device struck him and his cameraman, and Woodruff was subsequently kept in a medically induced coma for 36 months.During his recovery, he and his wife, Lee Woodruff, were inspired to launch their nonprofit, the Bob Woodruff Foundation, after getting to know veterans who were dealing with the impact of hidden injuries such as traumatic brain injuries.“I would say almost every American wants to do something for veterans who served, but many don’t really know exactly where that support should go because it’s very complicated,” Bob Woodruff said. “We just kind of help people who want to do something, find the right direction to help people.”To date, the foundation says it’s invested over $124 million in these programs and has given over 585 grants to veterans and their familiesAs for the future, Perry said it’s about continuing the conversation.“I think mental health is the most undiagnosed and unknown malady that we have in modern society, potentially,” he said. “It was there all along.”",health,0.0

We send our heartfelt sympathy to her loved ones, friends and family,” Valentini wrote in a social media post.Zeman first joined the cast of the long-running daytime drama in 1977, according to Imdb.“She leaves behind a lasting legacy for her Emmy-nominated portrayal of the bad girl turned heroine and will always be remembered for her kind heart and radiant spirit,” read a post from the “General Hospital” Twitter account. “We are devastated by the news of her passing, and send our deepest condolences to Jackie’s family, friends and loved ones.”Born in Englewood, New Jersey, Zeman completed her high school studies at the age of 15 and received a dance scholarship from New York University.She danced and modeled professionally while pursuing her studies before landing a role on “One Life to Live” in 1976.What was supposed to be three days of work ended up as more than a year portraying the character of Lana McClain, and the role gave Zeman a taste for daytime television.She then snagged the role as nurse Bobbie Spencer on “General Hospital” that would make her famous.Zeman had acted in commercials and as a Playboy bunny to help pay the bills prior to her big break on the soap opera.“I did a lot of traveling when I worked for Mr. Hefner and I loved that,” she said during an interview with “The Locher Room” that was streamed nine months ago on YouTube. “It taught me how to do interviews, it taught me how to be on TV, you know, a lot of things that later on when I became an actress and I had an opportunity to promote my shows I was very comfortable with that.”Zeman also appeared in Broadway and off-Broadway productions and movies, including “Young Doctors in Love” and “National Lampoon’s Class Reunion.From 2010 to 2022, she portrayed Sofia Mason on the drama, “The Bay.”The actress loved her time on “General Hospital” and was beloved in return by not only viewers, but also her costars on the show.Rick Springfield, who portrayed Dr. Noah Drake on the soap, told CNN in a statement he was “incredibly stunned and brokenhearted to hear of Jackie’s passing.”“Such a truly kind soul with no touch of the diva and only sweet things to say about everyone,” Springield said. “She was the one (along with [producer] Gloria Monty) who helped launch my 80s career when after the screen test along with several other hopeful young men Gloria asked Jackie who she thought would make a good Noah Drake and God bless her if Jackie didn’t say me.”“Love to your spirit as it ascends sweet girl,” he added. “You left your mark on many of us and you will not be forgotten.”",entertainment,0.0

Yet the Irish actor has revealed that fans are actually “underwhelmed” when they meet him.Speaking in a rare and wide-ranging interview with Rolling Stone UK for its latest issue, released Thursday, Murphy opens up about his uneasiness with fame and being in the spotlight.“I don’t really partake. I don’t go out. I’m just at home mostly, or with my friends, unless I have a film to promote. I don’t like being photographed by people. I find that offensive,” Murphy said.The 46-year-old believes his fans are underwhelmed at his lack of “charisma” and “swagger.”“I think it’s the Tommy Shelby thing. People expect this mysterious, swaggering… it’s just a character. I do feel people are a little bit underwhelmed. That’s fine, it means I’m doing my job,” continued Murphy, adding the 1920s Birmingham gangster of Shelby “couldn’t be further from me.”Discussing fame, Murphy added: “It can ruin experiences, because it fetishises everything: You can be walking down the street and someone takes a picture … but that’s part and parcel of it.”Despite this, Murphy never shies away from taking on Hollywood’s big roles.In July, he will join Oscar-winning film director Christopher Nolan, starring in his latest blockbuster “Oppenheimer.”The movie, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, is about atomic bomb creator J. Robert Oppenheimer.Murphy will star as Oppenheimer, with the movie focusing on the 1945 Trinity Test in New Mexico, where the world’s first nuclear device was detonated successfully.Nolan told Rolling Stone UK: “Cillian has this extraordinary empathetic ability to carry an audience into a thought process. He projects an intelligence that allows the audience to feel that they understand the character and see layers of meaning.”The pair have a long history of working together, with Murphy appearing in “The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception” and “Dunkirk.”“I always hoped I could play a lead in a Chris Nolan movie. What actor wouldn’t want to do that?” Murphy added.“I was a Chris Nolan fan. That’s how I was when I met him for the first time … So, it feels absurd that I’ve been in six of his films,” the actor said.",entertainment,0.0

TJ and his friend Ji-Young, a Korean American muppet who debuted in 2021, talk to the actor about the word of the day: confidence.Confidence, Penn explained, is “when you believe in yourself and your abilities, or in the abilities of others.” TJ marvels at Grover’s confidence as he attempts to jump over the Sesame Street sign while riding a unicycle and balancing a tall stack of books. And when Penn shares with TJ and Ji-Young that he leans on others when he doesn’t feel confident, TJ opens up about his own experiences.“I’m learning Tagalog. It’s a language my Filipino family speaks and I have confidence because I can always ask my lola for help when I don’t know a word,” TJ says.TJ is 4 years old and a second generation Filipino American, a spokesperson for Sesame Workshop told CNN. He enjoys entertaining his little sister, gardening with his grandparents and spending time with his other family members when they visit from California.“He loves it when they all get together so he can help his mom make lumpia with all the veggies he picked, and so he can play basketball and have a dance off with his cousins,” Sesame Workshop said.The character of TJ is voiced by puppeteer and performer Yinan Shentu and created in part by Bobby Pontillas, a Filipino American animator. Pontillas wrote on Instagram that he collaborated with Louis Mitchell, Sesame Workshop’s creative director of character design, on the character. TJ’s appearance, Pontillas said, was based on two of his friends’ children.Rosemary Espina Palacios, Sesame Workshop’s director of talent outreach, inclusion and content development, also celebrated TJ’s arrival on Sesame Street.“I’m so proud to help bring some Filipino representation to the neighborhood, and just in time for API Heritage Month to show the range in our diaspora,” she wrote on Instagram. “His first segment with @kalpenn and Ji-Young is all about confidence, something I personally feel can help unravel the model minority stereotype.”TJ is the latest addition to a diverse cast of new characters on “Sesame Street.” In addition to Ji-Young, the program’s first Asian American muppet, the show introduced two Black muppets in 2021: Wes and his father Elijah.Last year, Ameera, a muppet character who uses a wheelchair, made her debut on “Ahlan Simsim,” the version of “Sesame Street” that airs in the Middle East and North Africa.",entertainment,0.0

A horde of celebrity cameos provide occasional pop along the way, but beyond Muppets completists the 10-episode series provides a little too much reason to sound like Statler and Waldorf.The deft balance that defined “The Muppets Movie” back in 2011 is mostly lacking in this Disney+ show from “The Goldbergs” producer Adam F. Goldberg, in part because the human characters and ongoing story built around them fall short. That begins with former NBC later-night host Lilly Singh as Nora, the aspiring record executive who realizes that the band owes her label an album that was never delivered, prodding them to veer off the road and into the studio.The show then proceeds to set up a rather tedious triangle involving Nora (with whom Animal is also instantly smitten), who is caught between an Electric Mayhem fan (Tahj Mowry) who loves the group and an oily record executive (Anders Holm).Deriving the episode subtitles from various songs (a device also employed by “Daisy Jones & the Six”), “Muppets Mayhem” certainly doesn’t scrimp on celebrity appearances or playful flourishes, from employing animation to an extensive flashback showing why vocalist Dr. Teeth (who objects to the designation “front man”) didn’t go into the family business.The number of stars who fleetingly participate underscores just how much built-in goodwill still resides within the Muppets name. When there are plans within the show for an Electric Mayhem documentary to boost album sales, directors Kevin Smith and Peter Jackson (after his ode to the Beatles) drop by.All the gags about rock stars being impulsive and eccentric, however, feel like one long inside joke, and the situations involving Nora – when she isn’t wrangling her uncooperative stars – are for the most part as cartoonish as the antics of Dr. Teeth, Animal, Lips, Janice, Floyd Pepper, and Zoot.Hungry for streaming content, Disney (which has owned the Muppets since 2004) has tried various wrinkles to keep rekindling the franchise following the aforementioned movie and its sequel, with a “The Office”-like series for ABC, and “Muppets Now” and the special “Muppets Haunted Mansion” in 2020 and 2021, respectively, both for Disney+.“Muppets Mayhem” is an inoffensive addition to that library, but in terms of hitting memorable creative beats, its “Electric” characters don’t come close to catching lightning in a bottle.“The Muppets Mayhem” premieres March 10 on Disney+.",entertainment,0.0

Here’s why,2023-05-09 08:41:00,"Jamie Foxx was hospitalized weeks ago but there’s still not much publicly known.Anyone who has followed Jamie Foxx’s career closely, however, shouldn’t be surprised by that.On April 11, Foxx was hospitalized in Atlanta, Georgia, where he had been filming the Netflix movie, “Back in Action.”CNN has reached out to reps for Foxx multiple times for information on both what happened and the actor’s status, and has been unable to get additional details from them.There has been practically no information released other than his family initially asking for privacy and a post last week on Foxx’s verified social media account.“Appreciate all the love!!!” the post reads.“Feeling blessed.”The desire for privacy is in keeping with how the “Ray” star has always lived, despite a career that puts him in the spotlight.A perusal of interviews with Foxx over the years yields plenty of information about his thoughts on his roles, a multitude of jokes, some information about his childhood and very little insight into his actual personal life.Foxx reportedly dated fellow superstar Katie Holmes, the ex-wife of Tom Cruise, for half a dozen years – a relationship neither ever confirmed on the record despite being photographed over the years during what appeared to be romantic dates or moments where they were affectionate with one another.In 2016, former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” cast member Claudia Jordan appeared to confirm Foxx and Holmes were dating during a podcast appearance saying, “He is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy.”Jordan later clarified her comments, telling “Entertainment Tonight” she “misspoke.”“I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,” she said. “I’ve never seen them together.”Two years later, Foxx was being interviewed by SportsCenter host Michael Smith about participating in an NBA celebrity basketball game when Smith asked the star, “Did you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine’s Day? Like some real Love & Basketball?”Foxx abruptly ended the interview by taking off his headset and walking away.Foxx and Holmes reportedly split in 2019.So the silence surrounding Foxx’s “medical complication,” to use his family’s words initially, seems in keeping with how the performer conducts himself.Celebrities have handled such situations in a variety of ways, from Jeremy Renner’s very public recuperation following being run over by a snow plow to Chadwick Boseman’s colon cancer diagnosis not becoming public until after the “Black Panther” actor’s death.Those who know Foxx have been circumspect when they do talk about his current state.During an interview on the “Impaulsive” podcast released last week, Kevin Hart said he was “fortunate” to have a close enough friendship with Foxx that he can check on him.Hart said Foxx is “getting better” and also touched on why not much has been shared about him publicly from Foxx’s inner circle.“They’re being tight for reasons just about where he is because Jamie’s always been a private person to a certain degree,” Hart said.Fox network has announced that that Nick Cannon will be filling in as guest host on “Beat Shazam,” a musical game show that Foxx hosts with his daughter, Corinne.A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Foxx was transported to the hospital via emergency vehicle.",entertainment,0.0

She had been filming “Dead to Me” and the show paused production so she could start treatment.Applegate added that she will miss the show, telling Vanity Fair that she loves her coworkers and crew, but that the past year has been a “struggle.”“I miss the experience of it, but at the same time, because it was such an incredible struggle this last year, I’m relieved that I no longer have to push so hard to get through my day,” she said.",sport,0.0

I hate it but I love you guys,” he said.Wallen said he is also no longer appearing at the Academy of Country Music awards on Thursday, and will be performing at the 2024 editions of the music festivals that he was previously scheduled to perform at this year.Wallen’s representatives confirmed in a news release that the new tour dates will be announced soon, and a 30-day refund will be offered for current ticket holders.Wallen’s vocal cord troubles first became apparent in April when he abruptly canceled a Mississippi tour stop when he informed concertgoers that his voice is “shot” and he was “unable to sing,” per his doctors.Leaving on a positive note, Wallen promised his listeners on Tuesday that he’ll see them soon and will be back “better than ever.”",world,0.0

(A Disney adult can be defined in many ways depending on one’s level of fandom, but the term tends to refer to a grown person that is a dedicated Disney fan.)Johansson shed some light on her level of Disney devoutness in a new Variety interview published on Tuesday, where it was revealed that the actor still visits Disney World at least 10 times a year and was described as somebody who “geeks out” when speaking about Disney movies.“We had annual passes to Disney World, and I have a real passion for the Disney parks,” Johansson said, adding that the obsession with Disney began when her family lived in Florida for two years when she was younger.She went on to share that when she was growing up, “it was a great time for Disney animation — ‘The Little Mermaid’ and ‘Aladdin’ and ‘Lion King’ with the incredible soundtrack. Like, I will be pre-buying tickets to ‘The Little Mermaid.’”“I actually need to text my sister about that,” she added.The star even said her dream job is to have a “corner office” on the Disney studio lot when she appeared on Bruce Bozzi’s “Table for Two” podcast in 2022.Johansson has appeared in nine Disney-owned Marvel films as the Black Widow, since 2010, and is still attached to headline Disney’s Taika Waititi-directed “Tower of Terror” movie based on the iconic  theme park ride.Johansson sued the studio in 2021, alleging Disney breached her contract by releasing “Black Widow,” a 2021 Marvel film she starred in, on home streaming platform Disney+ the same day it was released in theaters.The actor claimed in the suit that the same-day streaming release would reduce her financial stake in the film because she agreed her salary would largely be based on the film’s box office numbers. When Bob Chapek, then-CEO of Disney, released a statement in which he revealed her $20 million salary, the legal battle escalated.Ultimately, Johansson and Disney came to a settlement in the fall of 2021, the terms of which were not publicly disclosed, and in what is perhaps the ultimate sign of pure Disney devotion, Johansson said in Tuesday’s interview that she harbors no bad blood.Remaining steadfast, she said, “I believe in the magic of Disney.”",entertainment,0.0

547,571,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/entertainment/writers-strike-column/index.html,Writers strike: Studios want writers to trust them on streaming. Here’s why they don’t,2023-05-10 15:22:00,"When Indiana Jones tells Marion Ravenwood “Trust me” in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” she tries to punch him in the face (again). Writers striking against the major studios have a pretty good idea how she felt. Because when studios say, “Trust us,” Hollywood’s talent has a long history that explains why they don’t.Among sticking points in the negotiations between the Writers Guild of America and the association representing studios (otherwise known as the AMPTP) is the question of residual payments, and what writers receive for work playing streaming services. The guild has asked for more transparency about streaming data, and to share in success from popular shows, as they have when a TV show ran long enough to sell its reruns into syndication.More than a week into its first strike in 15 years, the guild representing writers is again worried studios aren’t being forthcoming about their profits, a source of acrimony that prompted plenty of lawsuits in the past. And if studios were stingy about dispensing such information before, when there were regular Nielsen ratings to analyze, they’ve become even more opaque in the age of streaming, seldom providing hard data regarding how many people are watching TV shows and movies.Journalists, notably, have also been frustrated by the dearth of such information. While Netflix finally began making available guidance on its most popular shows in 2021, streaming services have generally remained reluctant to quantify their performance.In that respect streaming has merely added new wrinkles to an old problem – namely, the lack of trust in the talent-studio relationship. That dynamic is summed up by an old joke generally attributed to Mel Brooks, noting that studios have carved the words “The money is here. We dare you to find it” at the entrances to their lots. (CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery is an AMPTP member.)In the 1990s, a change in federal regulations cleared the way for studios to own major TV networks (and vice versa), triggering a series of lawsuits over programs like “Home Improvement” and “The X-Files.” Those shows were produced by the same company that broadcast them, prompting their creators to fret about sweetheart deals that failed to deliver fair-market value.Streaming has fueled renewed angst and anger about whether writers are fairly compensated when shows become hits. While the studios provided counter-offers to several of the writers’ contract demands, according to the guild questions about streaming residuals were flatly rejected.As the Hollywood Reporter reported, the WGA has sought viewership-based residuals “to reward programs with greater viewership,” according to a document released by the guild. Yet as the trade paper noted, “This would require viewership transparency, something that streamers have proved to be unwilling to provide, even to the stars of shows and movies.”The negotiations come as studios have seen the economics of streaming tested as they spend heavily to attract subscribers. At the same time, more consumers are dropping cable and satellite subscriptions (or “cord cutting”), clouding the future for linear networks.That disconcerting shift in the studios’ business model still doesn’t address the issue of talent sharing in streaming hits, and the financial benefits that flow from a show like “Stranger Things” or “Succession.”Speaking to Variety at a charity event, writer-director Judd Apatow summed up the problem, saying, “We have a system now that that does not reward success for a lot of these projects. If you make something and a billion people watch it, you don’t make more money than if it was a disaster.”The entertainment business has changed dramatically since the last writers’ strike ended in 2008, which preceded Netflix’s serious entry into the production game as well as the introduction of streaming services by Apple, Amazon, Disney, and other studios.In Hollywood labor disputes, there’s a tendency to get bogged down fighting the last war. But streaming, and the sense writers, actors and directors aren’t receiving everything they’re due from it, is really another Hollywood reboot. Like the upcoming Indiana Jones sequel, it’s the same guy in new clothes.Writers still want studios to open up their books, which they have historically been reluctant to do. Or as a former US president who once headed the Screen Actors Guild famously said – quoting a Russian proverb in regard to US-Soviet relations – “Trust, but verify.”",entertainment,0.0
549,573,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/07/tv-shows/succession-season-4-episode-7-recap/index.html,"As ‘Succession’ preps for a merger and election, Shiv and Tom steal the show",2023-05-07 22:29:00,"Editor’s note: The following contains major spoilers about the seventh episode of “Succession’s” fourth season, “Tailgate Party.”Well that sure went South quickly.While there were plenty of developments around the proposed deal between Waystar Royco and GoJo, as well as political posturing and horsetrading in advance of a presidential election, the heart of the seventh episode of the final season of  “Succession,” “Tailgate Party,” resided in the on-again, off-again relationship between Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) and her estranged husband Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen).The hour began with the two enjoying the renewed heat between them, even exchanging naughty texts. Yet if reconciliation seemed to be in the air as they hosted a high-powered event together – “We had a little break and we’re back,” Tom said, rehearsing how they’d explain things – the episode closed with the pair engaging in one of the most brutal verbal spats TV has ever witnessed.Trouble started brewing quickly, beginning with Shiv’s perplexed (and priceless) reaction when Tom gave her a scorpion as a gift. The situation escalated as Shiv squired Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård) around the party, smiling along as he alluded to post-merger changes that would include showing Tom the door.Shiv had been playing an angle, serving as Matsson’s insider and informant as he jockeyed with her brothers, who have sought, awkwardly, to torpedo the deal. Her resolve was tested, however, when Matsson balked at spelling out her role and subsequently admitted that he had been fudging subscriber numbers in India, hoping to hide those discrepancies in the rush of the Waystar acquisition.With both of them already agitated, Tom and Shiv finally unloaded on each other, in what played like the mother of all Emmy-campaign reels for their respective third nominations (Macfadyen won last year):“You’re a hick,” she told him.“You’re broken,” he said.“I don’t like you. I don’t even care about you,” she snapped.“It’s not my fault that you didn’t get his approval,” Tom said, regarding her fraught relationship with her father, before Shiv delivered the final, finishing blow: “You don’t deserve me. And you never did.”Obviously, there was a lot else going on within the hour, from Matsson dismissing the Roy boys as “failsons” to Gerri (J. Smith-Cameron) threatening Roman (Kieran Culkin) with unleashing the very-private text messages he had sent her in order to secure a favorable financial settlement after the previous week’s bloodbath. Plus, there was the little matter of trying to grease Connor (Alan Ruck) with an ambassadorial post in order to get him to drop out of the presidential race, and Greg (Nicholas Braun), a.k.a. “Gary” to Matsson, notifying employees about layoffs via a painfully stiff Zoom call.All of that paled, however, next to the epic Tom-and-Shiv roller-coaster ride. Those scenes played like a gift to “Succession” fans and Snook and Macfadyen, who, with apologies to that scorpion, put enough sting in their zingers to deserve every accolade that goes with them.",entertainment,0.0

As it turns out, a lot can happen in eight years, as the series jumped into a strange, new world.HBO’s dark comedy did, indeed, take a giant leap into the future, one that finds Barry (Bill Hader) and his now-partner Sally (Sarah Goldberg) living off the grid in the middle of nowhere, having embraced religion while hiding out in a house surrounded by pastel nothingness.Seemingly bored out of her mind, the only acting Sally now gets to do involves working as a waitress named Emily at the local diner, taking out her hostility on a fellow employee who harbored salacious fantasies about her. As for Barry (a.k.a. Clark), he’s home-schooling their young son, while opening up just enough to begin sharing some stories about his days as a Marine.“Barry” has always taken chances, but this time-flip at the midway point reflected one of its most daring yet, stranding its main character and the woman who ran away with him in a life of domestic drudgery. Enough time has passed that the awful Marvel-like movie on which Sally was serving as an acting coach has spawned three sequels, as evidenced by a “Megagirls 4” billboard featuring her former student.Still, “Barry” saved what promises to be its most significant wrinkle for the end, offering a path back to reconnect the characters, as acting coach Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler) emerged after being missing and presumed dead for eight years. Why? Because he got wind of the fact that Warner Bros. (like HBO and CNN, part of Warner Bros. Discovery, so you know, synergy) was working on a movie about his former student Barry Berkman, and as usual found himself unable to resist the siren call of Hollywood.Seeing his name and picture in the newspaper, Barry had an instant and ominous reaction: “I’m gonna have to kill Cousineau.” Which is where things stand, for now.“Barry” hasn’t quite been killing it this season, at least, not as unabashedly as it had in the past. The time jump felt understandably disorienting, especially given the fantasy sequences in which the program has indulged along the way.Those flourishes, however, and especially this latest batch of them, reinforced that there’s nothing quite like this very dark comedy in terms of sheer unpredictability. Barry’s final line thus offered not just an opportunity to go tie up loose ends, but further evidence, if any was needed, that while such narrative gambles are indeed tricky, they’re a fundamental part of this show’s legacy.",entertainment,0.0
569,593,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/puyi-watch-auction-patek-philippe/index.html,Last Chinese emperor’s luxury watch expected to fetch $3 million,2023-05-09 00:30:00,"A wristwatch once owned by China’s last emperor, Aisin-Gioro Puyi, is expected to fetch over $3 million when it goes on sale in Hong Kong this month.The eye-watering valuation is partly due to the rarity of the Patek Philippe Reference 96 Quantieme Lune, one of just eight known to exist. But according to Phillips auction house, which is handling the sale, the seven-figure estimate is also down to the 86-year-old watch’s remarkable history — one that saw it taken to Siberia during the former ruler’s five-year imprisonment in the USSR.The 1.2-inch-diameter platinum timepiece features an Arabic numeral dial, pink gold hands and a “moon phase” function that shows how visible the moon is from Earth at any given time. Some of its internal mechanisms date to 1929, though the model was not sold by Patek Philippe — a Swiss watchmaker known for fitting complicated movements into slim cases — until 1937.It is not known how Puyi acquired the timepiece, though records show it was initially sold via a luxury store in Paris. Phillips added that historical documents prove the former emperor took it with him to a Soviet prison camp in Khabarovsk. He later gifted it to Georgy Permyakov, a fluent Mandarin speaker who served as his tutor and Russian translator during his time in detention.Puyi, whose life formed the basis of the Oscar-winning 1987 movie “The Last Emperor,” ascended the throne as a mere toddler in 1908. He was forced to abdicate less than four years later when a republican revolt overthrew the Qing dynasty, though he was permitted to continue living in the imperial palace in Beijing (and was briefly reinstated as emperor in 1917).In 1924, he fled Beijing and formed an alliance with Japan, which later installed him as the emperor of its puppet state, Manchukuo, in northeast China’s Manchuria region. After Japan’s defeat in World War II, Puyi was captured by Soviet forces and held as a prisoner of war. According to Phillips, he gave the watch to Permyakov in 1950, just before the former emperor returned to China to face trial for war crimes.According to a press release, Phillips spent three years researching the object’s history and confirming its provenance — a process that Thomas Perazzi, the auction house’s head of watches for Asia, described in a statement as an “unprecedented research project with a worldwide team of watch specialists, historians, journalists and scientists.”In its catalog listing, Phillips cites Puyi’s nephew Yuyan (who was incarcerated alongside him) recalling in his memoirs that his uncle wore the watch “day to day” while in Manchukuo. The catalog also says that Puyi had previously gifted the watch to his nephew, but later asked for it back in order to give it to Permyakov.Almost a decade after returning to China, Puyi was pardoned and lived as a civilian in Beijing until his death in 1967. Permyakov, meanwhile, kept the watch until he died in 2005, after which it was passed to his heirs before being consigned to Phillips by its current owner in 2019. The timepiece has already been displayed in New York, Singapore, London and Taipei, and will travel on to Geneva before returning to Hong Kong, where it will go on sale at Phillips’ new Asia headquarters on May 23.The watch is being offered alongside several other of Puyi’s former possessions. Among them are 15 watercolors, attributed to Puyi’s brother-in-law Gobulo Runqi, and a red paper fan also given to Permyakov, featuring a poem inscribed by the former emperor.One of Puyi’s manuscript notebooks, which Phillips says “provides a never-before-seen glimpse into (his) mind,” is also being sold alongside his copy of Confucius’ “The Analects,” with the two items expected to together fetch over $25,000.The sale will be followed by a two-day watch auction at Phillips featuring some 240 timepieces. Among the historically notable items featured is a limited-edition Omega Speedmaster Apollo XI 1969 once presented to NASA astronaut Charles “Pete” Conrad Jr., the third person ever to walk on the moon.",style,0.0
570,594,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/south-korea-photo-booth-studios-trend-intl-hnk/index.html,This Y2K pastime is becoming a big hit among South Korean youth,2023-05-03 22:10:00,"A group of girls giggle as they try on a pair of pink glasses, plush pig hats and bunny ears. At another counter of the studio, one carefully straightens her hair. Together, they cram into a photo booth, pose, and then marvel at the photo strips the machine drops below. They tape one onto a wall filled with images of other young patrons.It’s a familiar scene playing out at several hundred small photo studios that have recently opened in Seoul. The spaces — with no staff visibly present — typically house three to six booths and are open 24 hours a day.Since the pandemic, the studios have become one of the trendiest destinations among South Korean Gen Z. On the main thoroughfare of Hongdae, the city’s busiest district, they’re found on every block — sometimes, only a few feet apart.20-year-old university student Choi Hui-je told CNN he visits a studio every time he goes out with friends, which is around five to seven times a month. Once, he recalled in a phone interview, he went five times in one week.“It’s a necessary stop. We go for food, karaoke, café, and then the photo studio,” Choi said.19-year-old Jenny Dall’alba, a student in the southern city of Busan, estimates she’s gone more than 70 times over the past few years.“This is not a fad but a must-go-to every time,” she said.Many around the world may have their own memories of hopping into similar booths. In the early 2000s, they surged in popularity thanks to the development of digital technology and coveted sticker versions.But two decades later, in the age of social media and post-pandemic, they’ve taken on a whole new life in South Korea.With over 245 locations in the Seoul Metropolitan area and 200 more around the country, Life4Cuts has a major share of the market: the brand estimates 2 million people visit their studios every month.On Instagram there are more than 1.1 million posts with the hashtag Life4Cuts (in Korean) — with everyone from K-pop stars to influencers posting the outcome of their shoots.Some are seen copying poses from viral TikTok videos or mimicking anime characters’ famous moves. Choi himself likes to channel the expressive memes of pink beaver character Zanmang Loopy from the 2003 South Korean animation Pororo the Little Penguin.Dall’alba, who keeps all her photos together in a pouch, says she enjoys getting creative by choosing different props and frames. She adds that her friends like to pose with K-pop group members that are baked into each frame and go multiple times to make sure to get a photo with every star.There are also Instagram accounts dedicated to teaching visitors poses to try the next time in a studio.Booths nowadays have better lighting and features like timelapses which have contributed to their popularity.Business owners see the studios as a safe investment opportunity.Kim Joo-hyun opened his Busan-based Life4Cuts studio in 2020, when his restaurant began struggling during the pandemic. With no government permit required to operate, he was able to set up a shop in less than a month, with a relatively moderate investment of 180 million won ($134,000).“There is a widespread notion that you won’t lose money opening them,” Kim said over the phone, adding that it doesn’t take much physical work and he’s seen a profit margin of 50%. And while Kim is concerned with growing competition, he is also actively searching for another location to open a studio.Kim was initially skeptical of whether the studios would be a passing fad, but as people started bringing their family, older relatives, and even dogs into the booth he’s since changed his mind.“(Customers) can buy small but guaranteed happiness,” he said, for little money at about 4,000 won or $3 a pop. “The day-to-day life may be difficult but they can enter and exit with a smile on their face.”The tangible aspect of the photos may be what’s particularly appealing to Gen Z. But Choi says there’s something deeper — the pandemic reminded him and others of how precious life is.“We know well our youth will not last. It’s to remember the precious moments.”",style,0.0
571,595,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/elizabeth-siddal-tate-britain-untold-art-history/index.html,She was a ‘supermodel’ of the Pre-Raphaelite period. Now art historians are course-correcting the short life of Elizabeth Siddal,2023-05-08 15:09:00,"Even if you’re not familiar with Elizabeth Siddal, you likely know the 19th-century paintings she modeled for, artworks in which she slipped into others’ tragedies.There’s Siddal as Ophelia drowning in the lush riverbank among forget-me-nots, or as the poet Dante Alighieri’s dying beloved, glowing with the ecstasy of reverie. You’ve perhaps also heard the melancholic retellings of Siddal’s own arc: muse with a turbulent love life; fragile health; life cut short at 32 due to the opiate laudanum poisoning her blood.But you might not know Siddal’s own groundbreaking work as an artist and poet: her vibrant, emotionally expressive paintings, or her ballads of yearning. A new exhibition at the Tate Britain in London, “The Rossettis,” seeks, in part, to change that. The show, which focuses on Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who became her husband, his poet sister Christina, and Siddal, brings together more than 30 of Siddal’s works, the most seen together in 30 years.Siddal was the only woman to exhibit work with the short-lived but highly mythologized Pre-Raphaelite movement, which formed in 1848 and prized the period of 15th-century Italian artmaking that saw the medieval era give rise to the Renaissance. And though Siddal later became known for her modeling — for Rossetti, John Everett Millais and other artists — scholars and curators are shifting the attention to her rarely shown surviving art, which numbers some 60 works on paper and a handful of paintings. (Some of her lost works are shown for the first time at the Tate through photographs taken after her death).Tate curator Carol Jacobi says both the “physical fragility” and sparse number of works have led to few shows dedicated to Siddal. “But it is also the fact that she is very much eclipsed by the much more famous artists that were around her,” Jacobi explained in a video call. “And we cannot deny that, particularly for historical women artists, it’s still a bit of a battle.”Siddal’s works eschewed realism and delighted in beauty and fantasy. Her art often depicted emotionally charged scenes from poetry, like the jewel-toned painting “Lady Clare,” based on an Alfred Tennyson ballad in which the titular character finds out her life has been a lie. In another piece, “The Macbeths,” Siddal paints herself and Rossetti as the ill-fated couple, driven mad by prophecy.Most of the artist’s works are watercolors and drawings. Her only known oil painting — a delicately rendered self-portrait on a circular canvas — is among those lost to time.Reframing the focus on Siddal as a pioneering artist in her own right, rather than on her proximity to male luminaries, is an overdue course-correction. It’s also one many institutions are taking with famous “muses” of art history; photographer Dora Maar, who rose to fame as Picasso’s “Weeping Woman,” and painter Suzanne Valadon, who danced across Renoir’s scenes, are two such artists who have received important retrospectives in the past handful of years.In Siddal’s case, this path to recognition has not been linear. Curator and scholar Jan Marsh has been championing Siddal as a key member of the Pre-Raphaelites since the 1980s, when feminist theory overhauled frameworks around women artists. (Marsh has contributed an essay to the exhibition catalog). Still, myths and misconceptions about Siddal persist, as the ingredients of a tragic heroine’s life fill in the gaps of knowledge around her.“A lot of the stories that are told about Elizabeth are not really stories about Elizabeth — they are stories about Dante Gabriel: his love affair and the inspiration of his art, and the Elizabeth that he creates in his poems and his pictures. And so she gets eclipsed in lots of different ways,” Jacobi said, pointing to the fact that much of what is known about Siddal comes from Rossetti biographies. “I think it’s still really hard to get at that real person.”Television and film interpretations have run with this narrative, from the 2009 BBC miniseries about the Rossettis called “Desperate Romantics,” to the 1967 drama centered on Dante Gabriel, “Dante’s Inferno.” The Ken Russell-directed film, which begins with Siddal’s exhumation, “distills the mainstream idea of Elizabeth, and how powerful the ‘haunted woman’ is as a myth,” Jacobi said.Siddal deserves more than the oversimplified tales about her life. Though she had several months of art schooling and intentionally pursued her creative development, the myth that she was simply discovered by the Pre-Raphaelites while working in a hat shop has stuck, taking away her agency, as Jacobi and Marsh point out. Her physical maladies and opiate addiction have also likely been exaggerated. (Being in fragile health was a gendered cultural signifier in Victorian times, and laudanum, then a sleeping agent and painkiller, was a cure-all for everything.)Even her death, speculated as suicide, is poorly understood. Marsh writes Siddal more than likely died from an opiate overdose while in post-partum psychosis after her daughter was stillborn, but that there has been little concrete evidence she was an addict.And while many art historians have waved away Siddal’s work as largely influenced by her husband, Jacobi says they often worked collaboratively, and that he was taking just as many ideas from her.Her prescience might have been more readily apparent had Siddal lived to see the next era of art unfold — one that she influenced without her knowledge.In one of her drawings, “Lovers Listening to Music,” from 1854, she abandons any narrative in a scene of an affectionate couple — likely based on herself and Rossetti — serenaded by two figures with instruments.“It’s very unusual because there is no story; it is simply a mood, a reverie of love,” Jacobi said.Three years later, Dante Gabriel repeated the musical motif in “The Blue Closet,” which is presented in the Tate’s exhibit adjacent to Siddal’s drawing. His painting in turn greatly influenced the artist William Morris, a key figure in the aesthetic movement, which reveled in beauty and art for art’s sake, rather than realistic scenes of life or moralizing allegories.In hindsight, there’s a “direct genealogy” from Siddal’s approach to aestheticism, a movement which included artists such as James Whistler and Aubrey Beardsley and writers such as Oscar Wilde, Jacobi said. “But of course, she wasn’t part of that story, because she died.”Through “The Rossettis,” Jacobi would like to put forth the real narrative of Siddal: A working-class woman who struck out to be a painter and poet during a highly restrictive era for someone of her gender and social standing. Her work, like that of many women creatives, was not exhibited by mainstream institutions  — the Royal Academy of Arts, at the time — and in fact, she rebelled against their tastes.“She was painting in (her) own way… largely self-taught — that is the story of a modern artist,” Jacobi said. “And I think she was just 30 years before her time.” Top image: Rossetti’s portrait of Siddal as Beata Beatrix. The painting, of Beatrix’s death, is based on Dante Alighieri’s 13th-century poem “La Vita Nuova.”",style,0.0
572,596,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ramata-toulaye-sy-interview-banel-and-adama-cannes-2023-spc-intl/index.html,"Meet Ramata-Toulaye Sy, the director competing for the Palme d’Or with her first film",2023-05-08 05:29:00,"When the lineup for the Cannes Film Festival was announced on April 13, it featured plenty of familiar names: Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes; Cannes stalwarts including Hirokazu Kore-eda, Ken Loach and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Towards the end of the list was Ramata-Toulaye Sy – not yet a familiar name, but that could be about to change.A surprise addition to the official selection, French Senegalese director Sy has joined a small club of filmmakers to compete for the Palme d’Or – the festival’s top prize – with their first feature. (The last time this happened was in 2019, when Mati Diop and Ladj Ly – both with connections to Africa – won second and third prizes respectively.)As debuts go, it’s a daunting one. Few places possess a more glaring spotlight than Cannes, and premiering a movie there is a trial by fire that tests the nerves of even the most experienced filmmakers. (There’s a reason reviews are embargoed until after actors and directors have walked the red carpet.) For Sy, who has only previously attended the festival as a student, it’s a leap into the big leagues. But anyone who’s watched her short film “Astel” will have seen she possesses talent in abundance.Her feature film “Banel & Adama” features a young couple (played by Khady Mane and Mamadou Diallo) at odds with their community in northern Senegal, the region where Sy’s parents were born. Cast with non-professional actors who perform in local language Pulaar, the director said the film draws on her dual nationality and the storytelling traditions of both Europe and Africa, combining “everything I know, everything I am and everything that I love.”Ahead of the film’s premiere later this month, she spoke on a video call to discuss her festival debut, streaming versus cinemas and the state of African filmmaking.The following interview was conducted in French via a translator, and has been edited for length and clarity.CNN: Competing for the Palme d’Or with your debut feature is a huge achievement. What can you share about submitting your film to Cannes?Sy: The film has been wrapped for a month and a half. We sent a version to Cannes which was not completely finished – there was still color grading to do, a bit of mixing. As soon as they saw it, they called us and said they wanted the film for Un Certain Regard (a separate competition, where new voices are more common). I was really happy because it’s a great selection for a first-time feature. But the day before the press release, Christian Jeune (Cannes deputy general delegate) called me at midnight and announced that the film will be in competition. It was a big surprise for me and all the team.Where did the idea for “Banel & Adama” come from?I studied at La Fémis – a film school in France – in the screenplay department and it was my end-of-studies screenplay in 2014 to 2015. Then it sat in a drawer for a long time because I wasn’t ready to direct yet and I was more interested in (screen)writing. I think I needed time to find my voice and navigate the film industry. I started (directing) with a short film, “Astel,” in 2020 and then straight into a feature film in 2022.What can you share about the story at this stage?It’s a tragedy. At first, “Banel & Adama” feels like a classic love story; Banel and Adama are a happily married couple living in a remote village in the region of Fouta (northern Senegal). They are fiercely in love. But this love affair is going to bring chaos in the village, because in their community there is no room for passion. Little by little, we realize that this love story focuses more on Banel than Adama – it turns into the story of a woman trying to fulfill herself.Why set your first feature in Senegal?Even though I was born and raised in France, I have a deep bond with Africa, and the (West African) Fulani culture and traditions. For me, it is important to tell stories that take place in Africa because this continent has to be seen and needs to be recognized more than it does today, with more universal and different stories – not just stories about how poor the continent is, the war, the terrorism. For me, doing my first feature in Senegal is like a political gesture.You were born and raised just outside Paris, and live between Paris and Dakar, Senegal today. How has straddling two countries shaped who you are as a person and your voice as a filmmaker?Having both these nationalities has helped me find my way and has helped me to form my worldview. With “Banel & Adama,” I really confront my double identity. It’s a film with several genres: storytelling with griots – African tales – but also Greek and European tragedy, Afro-American magical realism and poetry.Could you talk me through the process of casting non-professional actors?We had the same casting director (as “Astel,” Iman Djionne) who started casting five months before shooting. I really needed people who have the physiognomy of the Fulani and who speak this language. We did several castings in several cities and villages.Banel was the most complicated character to find. We found her very, very late and it was I who found (Khady Mane) by chance when I was walking in the street. The first thing I saw were her eyes. Banel is quite a mythical and mystical character. In (Khady’s) eyes, there was something quite mysterious – a certain madness. Maybe it’s me imagining, because in real life Khady is a very shy person. But those eyes attracted me, so I asked her to audition the next day.With the rise of streaming platforms, there’s perhaps never been greater access to world cinema and African stories. Where do you stand on streaming? Should Netflix come along and say, ‘Here’s a huge check,’ would you consider it?It’s not me who decides, but rather the international sellers. Of course it’s better to see films at the cinema. Nothing can be more beautiful than the experience of watching on a big screen in a dark room surrounded by strangers. But when you don’t have access, it’s more important to see them anyway. Today, a cinema ticket in France is around €15 ($16.50) – it’s super expensive. There are plenty of families who can’t afford that. In Africa, people have more access on streaming platforms than cinemas. The most important thing is that people see the films.Senegal has one of the richest cinematic traditions in Africa. What factors do you think have contributed to that?The Senegalese film scene was very active between the 70s and 90s and then it began to disappear as cinemas started to disappear. Gradually, there were very few screens left. Since the 2010s cinemas have returned. Canal Olympia has opened one movie theater with one screen in Dakar, Cinema Ousmane Sembène followed, and Pathé recently opened a cinema with seven screens. I think the golden age of Senegalese cinema is coming back into force – and this time with more women. I’m very happy to be part of it.Will you be premiering the film in Senegal any time soon?Of course! Pathé Afrique is our African distributor. We’ll have an event in their brand-new venue in Dakar.And will you screen the film in the Fouta region?I hope so. It is going to be more difficult because of the infrastructure that we’d have to bring over there, like projectors and screens. But yes.Returning to Cannes, what are you most looking forward to?The projection in the Grand Theatre Lumière. I’m scared and I’m very excited. Two thousand people in the room, with the press, with the jury. That’s going to be something – it makes you dream.“Banel & Adama” will have its world premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, which runs from May 16-27.",style,0.0

SeaLegacy was started by Nicklen and Mittermeier to use storytelling to protect the ocean.According to a paper published in 2020, investments of $175 billion per year will be needed to conserve and ensure sustainable use of the ocean, to meet United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 – “Life Below Water.”“As a small group of photographers, we’re just going to raise a drop of that,” Mittermeier said in a press release. “The hope, however, is that we’re going to shine a spotlight on the ocean.”The ocean faces many problems; more than 17 million metric tons of plastic entered the ocean in 2021, a figure that is projected to double or triple by 2040, according to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022. It also faces threats from warming, overfishing, and acidification.“The health of our ocean determines the health of our planet. When we protect the sea, we are not only safeguarding the countless species that call it home, but we are also ensuring our own survival,” said Teron.Curated by Kathy Moran, former National Geographic deputy director of photography, 100 for the Ocean features prints from world-renowned photographers including Steve McCurry, Jimmy Chin and Joel Sartore.Teron added that the purpose of 100 for the Ocean resonated with many photographers, who saw it as an opportunity to create a lasting impact through their art.",style,0.0

For others, it’s an enticing snack.On Thursday, an art student from Seoul National University found it to be the latter, when he removed the fruit — an iconic work by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan — from off a wall at the Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, South Korea where it was displayed. Then he proceeded to devour it.“The student told the museum he ate it because he was hungry,” a museum spokesperson told CNN in a phone call.Entitled “Comedian,” the work became one of the art world’s biggest viral moments when it sold for $120,000 at Art Basel Miami Beach in December 2019. Two other editions of the piece also sold at the fair.After chomping down the fruit, the student taped the peel back on to the wall. The peel was later replaced by the museum with a fresh banana.“It happened suddenly, so no special action was taken. The artist (Cattelan) was informed of the incident but he didn’t have any reaction to it,” the museum spokesperson added.The work is part of Cattelan’s solo exhibition WE that is currently running at the Seoul-based museum until July 16. The banana itself is regularly swapped out every two to three days, and is not for sale.Cattelan is known for satirical pieces that challenge popular culture, often provoking debates around conceptual art.This wasn’t the first time someone thought the artwork was ripe for picking.After the first edition of “Comedian” sold back in 2019, performance artist David Datuna unceremoniously plucked the banana on display at the Perrotin gallery at Art Basel in Miami and gobbled it up as stunned onlookers watched.Datuna relished in the stunt, posting to Instagram at the time saying “I really love this installation. It’s very delicious.” Later he defended the act, calling it an art performance at a press conference and not an act of vandalism.Prior to the headline-making sale of artwork, Perrotin told CNN the bananas are “a symbol of global trade, a double entendre, as well as a classic device for humor,” adding that Cattelan turns mundane objects into “vehicles of both delight and critique.” The artist did not provide potential buyers with instructions on what to do when the artwork starts to decompose.The artwork is also embroiled in a copyright battle. In 2022, Joe Morford, an artist from Glendale, California, alleged that Cattelan plagiarized his own 2000 artwork titled “Banana & Orange” — which sees the titular fruits affixed with duct tape onto painted green backgrounds on a wall.According to court documents, Morford, who is representing himself, had registered the artwork with the US Copyright Office and posted the work on his website, Facebook and YouTube accounts long before Cattelan created “Comedian.”Cattelan’s lawyers have argued that Morford has “no valid copyright,” to the elements of the artwork — the banana and the duct tape stuck against a wall.Another one of Cattelan’s viral artworks was a solid 18-carat-gold toilet “entitled” America, valued at around $6 million. It had been first installed at New York’s Guggenheim in 2016 and was open to use by visitors. Later in 2019, it was stolen from the birthplace of Winston Churchill at Bleinheim Palace in England where it was being exhibited. It has never been found.Top image caption: “Comedian,” a 2019 artwork by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, is seen in Seoul, South Korea.",style,0.0
576,600,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/project-562-matika-wilbur-hyphenated/index.html,Photographer Matika Wilbur set out to take portraits of every Native American tribe — these are the results,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","Over a decade ago, when Matika Wilbur began photographing all 562 federally recognized tribal nations in the US (a number which has since grown to 574), she wanted to make a comprehensive portrait of contemporary Indigenous life — one that not only corrected harmful, persistent stereotypes, but could be used as a positive resource for the youngest Native American generation.“Project 562 is rooted in narrative correction work,” Wilbur explained in a video call. “When I started, I was looking at uncovering contemporary Indigenous identity and really looking at what it looks like to be a Native person right now.”What Wilbur didn’t know at the time was that the series, and now recently published book, “Project 562: Changing the Way We See Native America”  — would catalyze her homecoming. Wilbur, who is a member of the Swinomish and Tulalip tribes in the Pacific Northwest, was living in Seattle in 2012 just before she began the project. By its end, when she had logged 450,000 miles on the road, Wilbur became pregnant, and she and her husband decided to return to live in Tulalip.“I made a very conscious decision to move home, so that my baby would have that relationship with this place,” Wilbur said. “So her afterbirth could be buried here, where her grandmother’s cedar tree is and where her ancestors are. I realized that was very important to me.”Project 562 is staggering in its scope, representing the Miccosukee Tribe in the Everglades all the way to the Siberian Yupik people far off the Alaska coast.The portraits — from elders and teens to multiple generations posing together — have a sense of intimacy and warmth, with each image accompanied by her collaborators’ own accounts of their lived experiences. Through its interviews, the project delves deeply into kinship and love, displacement and reconnection, the generational impacts of colonialism and racism, environmental justice and activism, and inclusion and belonging.As time went on, Wilbur felt deeply changed by the work, gaining a greater understanding of herself in relation to the land on which she was raised.“We do have these systemic ways of developing our children to have relationships with the place that they come from, and to… teach them to become stewards,” Wilbur said. “As I started traveling, I started to put together and realize the different ways that these different communities do that. For me, it felt intrinsic, because I grew up fishing, I grew up on canoes, I grew up going to the longhouse, I grew up going to ceremony. And all of these things made me a person of the tide, but I wouldn’t have told you 10 years ago, that that was how I identify.”And the more she traveled, the more she understood how “site-specific” her identity was, Wilbur explained. “I would meet the people of the blue-green waters and the people of the tall pine trees or the people that live within the four sacred mountains, and I would get to go to ceremonies and witness cultural protocol that made their communities deeply, intrinsically, inextricably connected to the land that they come from. That was profound for me.”Below are some portraits featured in “Project 562,” and the stories behind them.CHEYENNEDr. Henrietta Mann has been an educator for more than five decades, architecting Native American studies programs for multiple universities. She was recently honored with a National Humanities Medal by President Biden and appears on the cover of “Project 562.”“I wanted to have a matriarch on the cover,” Wilbur told CNN. “I really have thought a lot about rematriation (restoring sacred principles), and the work of rematriation and how important it is to uplift our women who have worked for decades, like Auntie Dr. Henrietta Mann who dedicated her life to the betterment of Indigenous people.”COLVILLE, YAKAMA, NEZ PERCE, SIOUX, SAMOANHannah Tomeo is an athlete and a Northwest Indian Youth Conference Princess. Wilbur photographed her in the Methow Valley outside of the multiday conference, which is hosted by a different tribe in the region each year. At the 2016-2017 event, Tomeo and Wilbur were both keynote speakers.“Running has been my absolute passion and my stability, but I felt as if no one wanted me to succeed in high school,” Tomeo told Wilbur for “Project 562.”“My teacher told me it was in my genetics to be an alcoholic; my basketball coach would drug test only me on the team; my track coach told me I would just be another stupid Indian runner with no chance in the real running world. I let those words motivate and push me until I earned the fastest times in the school, but they still wouldn’t let me race.” Tomeo was replaced in races with no explanation until she finally quit, she explained. “My spirit had officially been broken. I never thought I would run again. Then my dad gave me these words: ‘You can either be a quitter or come back a success story. Your choice.’”“That summer I trained harder than ever and came back strong. I made it to State. I made first team and placed in the Nike meet in Boise and at Footlocker in California… My story isn’t over.”TULALIPDarkfeather Ancheta (left) and her sister Bibiana have become “like sisters” to Wilbur, she noted in the book. Here they are pictured with Bibiana’s son, Eckos.“I had a dream about them standing there like (in the photograph) in front of Tulalip Bay,” Wilbur told CNN. “So I called them and asked them if I could take their photo in the way that I’d seen in my dream.”“Our communities still have these kinship systems and these familial ties where an auntie is like a second mom. She is the protector and equally invested in the growing of the child… I wanted to try to create an image with this image that really showed and encapsulated, you know, the way that we take care of our babies, the way we love our babies.”KĀNAKA MAOLIJoshua Mori is a farmer, teacher and founder of community, wellness and agriculture nonprofit Iwikua in Kauaʻi, Hawaii. Wilbur photographed him with one of his three children on his aquaponic farm, a method for water-based farming that uses fish as a natural fertilizer.“My work is about wanting to take back the food system and really attack colonialism at the source,” Mori told Wilbur for “Project 562.” “At our root source, our diet, which affects everything in our bodies — how we feel, how we think, how we love, how we procreate. Food, in my opinion, affects all of that. So we’re doing aquaponic farming, which is just taking a traditional model of a food system and just shrinking it down to modern technology. We take our traditional Native knowledge and integrate it with modern technology to make it more accessible.”“The kids learn when they come out here traditional hale building (house building), traditional farming, working in kalo patches, and also modern farming techniques,” he added. “They learn how to spearfish and fish traditionally. Also, star navigation. How to use all of the tools, really, how Hawaiians became Hawaiians.”YUP’IK, IÑUPIAQDrew Michael is a traditional Yup’ik mask-maker and identifies as Two Spirit, or having both masculine and feminine spirits. Michael and his twin brother were adopted and raised by non-Native parents in Alaska and spoke with Wilbur about reconnecting to his Indigenous identity. Wilbur photographed him in his home.“Growing up, I did not have a good sense of my culture or identity as a Yup’ik and Iñupiaq man… I did not have access to that until I took a carving class with my father,” Michael told Wilbur in “Project 562”. “I was able to create my own piece, my own representation, almost a copy of a mask in a book from an exhibition. That was the first time that I was introduced to my culture, and I felt like I was starting to own it a little bit. As I learned more about masks, why they were used, who used them, and then the ceremonies and rituals, I started to see and learn about myself through the masks.”“I know especially in Yup’ik culture, people were Two-Spirited, and typically they would be healers because they could see into both worlds, the masculine and feminine, and can almost hold hands with both… so, since I am Two-Spirited, and I also do masks and other forms, I try to talk about different healing within my work.”DINÉThe Mitchells have been married for more than six decades. Robert, a former railroad worker, now raises livestock on their land. The couple prefer to speak in Navajo, so their daughter-in-law translated for Wilbur. Wilbur spent her 30th birthday with them, and was treated to dinner, cake and gifts in their home.“There’s not a lot of Native people that you meet anymore that just speak their language. And so for me, it was a profound experience, to be in a home where they’re still living very traditionally, and taking care of sheep, and speaking their language,” Wilbur told CNN.“In my time on the road, I approached it in really the only way that I know how — which is as a Native person. You don’t show up empty-handed, you bring food, you stay a while. You leave traditional gifts behind, you stay in touch with folks, and so I felt really fortunate to get to meet these folks and to get to be in their home for a little while.”Out of frame, she said, there was a touch of chaos taking place. “There’s a drawn-back version of this portrait, where there’s a sheep licking me as I’m taking this photo and there’s two horses trying to eat my light… and that’s why they’re laughing.”SAN CARLOS APACHEJohn Sneezy, who identified as Two Spirit, was a Grass Dancer at powwows for more than three decades, but was not able to perform in the Traditional Cloth category — which Wilbur notes is danced by women — until 2016, when he participated in the Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirit Powwow (BAAITS). Wilbur photographed him in San Francisco. He died before the book published.“Our young Two Spirit people in Indian Country experience a lot of violence for their identity. John would say, ‘I dance, and I wear women’s regalia, and I want to be shown in your book like this,’” Wilbur recalled to CNN. “John called me and told me that it was really important to him that we continue to uplift stories about Two Spirit people, so that our young Two Spirit relatives feel safe and seen and heard.”“John had spent his whole life wanting to dance in a woman’s Apache dress, but didn’t feel safe to do so until he traveled to the Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirit Powwow, which I think says a lot about the way that members of the LGBTQ+ community are treated in some of our communities. It’s really important in national conversations about Indigenous identity that we make sure to acknowledge our Two Spirit relatives and create space for representation. And John would want me to share that with you.”“Project 562: Changing the Way We See Native America” is available now.Top image: Amanda Attla (Athabascan, Yup’ik) from Huslia, Alaska.",style,0.0
577,601,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/drag-queen-us-history-explainer-cec/index.html,The US has a rich drag history. Here’s why the art form will likely outlast attempts to restrict it,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","To many, the stereotypical image of a drag queen is one of a gay man dressed in exaggerated feminine getup, oversized wigs and heavy makeup. But drag’s image – and history – is far more complex.Drag is a grand dame in a glittering gown, commanding the stage with a power ballad or disco classic. Drag is also an underground performer twirling onstage to Madonna’s “Papa Don’t Preach.”It’s the glitzy cast of “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” and small-town performers with dedicated local followings. It’s a queen named Meatball dressed as a ghoulish exaggeration of George Santos, singing the “Greatest Showman” anthem “This is Me,” and a king named Mo B. Dick in a firetruck-red pompadour and drawn-on goatee. It’s cisgender and trans men, trans and cis women and nonbinary people. Its performers are gay and straight. It’s masculine and feminine; it’s neither or both.“Drag is the theatrical exaggeration of gender,” said Joe E. Jeffreys, a drag historian and adjunct instructor at New York University, who noted that the artform constantly subverts “what people think they know about gender.”At its core, drag is an art form that for over a century has affirmed and uplifted LGBTQ people who perform and enjoy it. But this year in particular, some US states have attempted to impose legislative measures that would impact where and when drag can be performed. In Tennessee, where the most restrictive measures to date were passed in March, people who perform in drag in an area where children could see them could be charged with a misdemeanor or felony. (The ban was temporarily blocked hours before it was expected to be implemented.)Drag has become increasingly visible in recent years through mainstream shows like “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and popular public events such as drag brunches, drag bingo and drag queen story hours, in which drag performers read children’s books to young audiences, often at libraries. Outside of the impact recent legislative measures will have on drag performers, many fear that trans people could also be wrongly criminalized for expressing their gender in public. And all of these bills are being introduced amid a wider campaign in many states to roll back the rights of queer and trans people.Drag probes and questions gender and social norms, provoking audiences to do the same – and that is “inherently political,” Jeffreys said.LGBTQ historians and performers say drag will endure in spite of any fearmongering and hate. Survival, they say, is baked into the art form’s long, defiant legacy.Drag is likely as old as gender norms – it’s a “part of the human condition,” said Larry La Fountain-Stokes, a professor of Spanish, American culture and women’s and gender studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who also performs in drag under the name Lola von Miramar.“As long as people have been using clothes or marking gender in different ways, you’ve had people transgressing and challenging those conventions,” he said in a phone interview.New York’s Harlem neighborhood is thought by many to be the birthplace of drag balls in the 1860s. There, Black queer and trans residents donned dresses and wigs to perform in a safe, creative environment. (One theory about the origin of the term “drag” is that it referenced the way gowns “dragged” across the floor; another is that it derived from Polari, a slang-y language used frequently by queer British men, Jeffreys said.)One of the first known people to call themselves a “queen of drag” was William Dorsey Swann. A formerly enslaved man, Swann in 1882 began hosting guests, many of them former slaves, for drag dances at his Washington, DC home.When Swann confronted police in a cream satin gown after they raided one of his parties in 1888, he was arrested and charged with “being a suspicious character.” He was arrested several more times throughout his life after protecting queer friends during raids, according to Channing Gerard Joseph, an LGBTQ historian and Princeton University instructor who has said he’s the first academic to highlight Swann’s contributions to drag history.Swann’s drag dances and subsequent arrests were some of the first recorded acts of resistance in the burgeoning queer liberation movement in America, in which drag has played an essential role for more than 100 years, said Nino Testa, an associate professor of professional practice in women and gender studies at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.“The pleasure was the resistance,” Testa said in a phone interview. “The celebration of queer joy when it’s been denied in all these other spaces is activism.”Drag performers were often stars of the vaudeville scene of the early 20th century, Jeffreys said. “Female impersonator” Julian Eltinge was a particularly popular performer who published a magazine and launched his own makeup line, Jeffreys said. Those who perform exaggerated forms of masculinity, now often referred to as drag kings, also commanded stages across the US, proving masculinity could be prodded as much as femininity.The term “homosexuality” came into greater circulation in the ’30s, Jeffreys said, as did “pansy acts” – hyper-feminine queens whose routines included innuendos about same-sex desire. And even though the ’50s were a “dark period” for queer and trans people, Jeffreys said, some drag acts like the Jewel Box Revue found national success and catered to mainstream audiences.Even after the counterculture movement took over the ’60s and sizable LGBTQ communities were forming in major cities, dressing in drag in public could still be dangerous. Police regularly raided gay bars in the US – until the late ‘60s, Jeffreys said, it was illegal for bars in New York to serve a drink to a “known homosexual.”Despite the pervasive danger of living authentically, drag performers in this era also experimented with the traditional drag format. Queens founded their own drag houses – and chosen families in the process; for many Black and Latino queer and trans people this was a reaction to the racism they faced within the gay pageant scene. This was also the era when lip syncing became the norm, Jeffreys said, and drag became less binary – “genderf**k” drag was used to describe some performers who weren’t easily defined as masculine or feminine.Offstage, many queens led collective efforts to aid queer and trans people. When the AIDS crisis worsened in the ’80s, groups like the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in San Francisco raised money to house AIDS patients and pay for their health care. Others gladly hosted events or lent their talents to fundraising efforts.“We had to get out on the street and save our own lives,” said Joan Jett Blakk, a drag queen who ran for US president in 1992.Blakk, then an advocate with AIDS grassroots organization Act Up and political group Queer Nation, never ran to win – she wanted to do “something different with drag and tie activism in,” she said in a phone conversation.“It’s great to think that you made a little dent in history,” Blakk said. “But I’m surprised we have to get back out in the streets again and keep going.”Trans drag performers have played a key role throughout the history of the art form – “you can’t tell the story of drag without trans people,” Testa said.As drag grew in popularity in the ’60s and beyond, many trans women found themselves performing because rampant transphobia and homophobia made it difficult to find other work. Drag was often a form of financial survival, said Testa.Devin Antheus, who coauthored the photo book “Legends of Drag” with Harry James Hanson, said many of the queens he and Hanson photographed and interviewed began performing in the ’60s and ‘70s, before terms like “trans” came into popular use.Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, two trans women of color best known for participating in the 1969 Stonewall protests, used several terms to describe themselves throughout their lives, whether it was drag queen, “transvestite,” which then wasn’t widely considered a slur and was more commonly used than “transgender,” or trans, La Fountain-Stokes said.“People of our generation and after grew up in a realm where identity categories are very important and delineated,” Antheus said over the phone. “And for a lot of the girls, both queens who currently now identify as trans and those who don’t, back in the day, there weren’t such precise divisions when people were in internal spaces … they all rolled together.”And yet, even within the LGBTQ community, trans women who performed in drag were often ostracized, particularly among some cisgender gay drag queens, according to Esther Newton, an anthropologist who authored the seminal 1979 book “Mother Camp” about Midwestern drag queens.Some trans drag queens who received hormone injections were “strongly deplored by stage impersonators who (said) that the whole point of female impersonation depends on maleness,” Newton wrote.That sentiment has not entirely disappeared. In 2018, RuPaul Charles, one of the world’s best-known drag queens and host of the Emmy-winning reality series “RuPaul’s Drag Race” franchise, said that he would “probably not” allow trans women who’d undergone gender-affirming procedures to compete on the series. (Despite this, several contestants had already come out as trans while appearing on the show or after their season aired, like Monica Beverly Hillz, Kylie Sonique Love and Peppermint.)“Drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once it’s not men doing it, because at its core it’s a social statement and a big f-you to male-dominated culture,” RuPaul said  in an interview with The Guardian,  positioning the “trans movement” and the “drag movement” as two dichotomous groups.RuPaul later walked back his comments, and the series has seen several trans contestants since, including Season 15 winner Sasha Colby. Many “Drag Race” cast members have graduated to appearances on Broadway,  sold-out tours and recording careers. But “Drag Race” has also skewed viewers’ definition of drag – no drag kings have ever competed on the series, Testa noted, and the judges have long imposed somewhat traditional beauty standards upon contestants.Drag’s growing popularity hasn’t come without challenges.While recent legislative attacks like Tennessee’s restrictions on public drag performances took some LGBTQ researchers and performers by surprise, Jeffreys said they shouldn’t be shocked.“As soon as anything gets that level of visibility, there’s going to be pushback,” he noted.Drag performers and scholars said they believe drag is being scapegoated as a distraction from serious issues in the US, including gun violence, poverty and institutional racism, all of which disproportionately impact LGBTQ people, particularly Black trans women.And as bills aim to limit drag performances in public, advocates fear how they might affect trans people who are not drag performers. Antheus said that if police interpret the law to apply to trans people wearing gender-affirming dress in public, they could potentially criminalize trans people’s very existence. The rights of trans people have already come under attack in more than half of US states, many of which have introduced bills that would restrict trans young people from receiving gender-affirming health care or from participating in a sport that matches their gender.There’s no evidence that exposure to drag “harms” children, as many conservative lawmakers and drag ban supporters claim, Testa said. These lawmakers falsely claim that drag performers “groom” or sexualize children, of which there is also no evidence. Drag acts containing sexual innuendos and adult themes take place in age-restricted bars or at events children aren’t allowed to attend or that require parental consent.What drag does do is expose people of all ages to alternative ways of thinking about gender and sexuality, La Fountain-Stokes said, and encourages spectators to consider their own identities more critically.“Queer people have always found creative ways to resist the violence of their experience and norms that have tried to restrict our ability to live freely in the world,” Testa said. “Drag is a process of that resistance. These communities formed as a response to harassment, exclusion and violence. I’m hopeful in the sense that we’ve done this before – we never stopped doing it.”Drag has survived for as long as it has because it’s always been a vessel for expression for queer and trans people who’ve had to carve their own paths. It’s why Alaska Thunderf**k, the blonde bouffanted winner of the second season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars,” first got into drag – to make art that wasn’t bound by rules. That, she said in an email, and to have pure, unadulterated fun.“The great thing about drag is that the second you think you’ve got it figured out, it changes and turns into something else,” Alaska wrote. “That’s why we’ll always survive.”Top image: An attendee at Wigstock, a festival that celebrates drag and queer and trans culture, poses for the camera.",style,0.0
578,602,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pretty-yende-king-charles-coronation-spc-intl/index.html,South African opera star will perform at coronation of King Charles III,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","“Pretty, are you sitting down?” South African soprano Pretty Yende was performing in Vienna last December when she received a call from her manager. She had just been booked for the biggest gig of her life: a performance at the coronation of King Charles III.On May 6, the world will witness the crowning of Charles III at Westminster Abbey, in London. The 2,000-strong congregation will include royalty and global leaders, and 12 new pieces of music have been commissioned to mark the occasion.As one of three soloists at the ceremony, it’s thought that Yende is the first African to be invited to perform solo at a British coronation.“I was overwhelmed, shocked, happy. All the emotions were just rushing in,” she said, remembering the invitation.But given the 38-year-old’s remarkable journey, it’s surprising that she was surprised at all.The story of how Yende reached the pinnacle of her career is an inspirational one. Born in a tiny, rural town formerly known as Piet Retief, now eMkhondo, in Mpumulanga, South Africa, she had a happy, conventional religious upbringing. Her most direct link to music was church hymns.Yende says that as a shy child, she always wanted to please her family. When her grandmother first invited her to sing in public, she knew how uncomfortable it would be to stand in front of people, but she obliged. It became the first step on the road to performing in front of massive audiences.Yende never considered a career in music – she intended to study accountancy at university. Then she saw opera for the first time on TV at the age of 16. “Hearing this music and the power of it, sounded like something supernatural. I did not believe human beings could do it,” she recalled.“I remember recording it and imitating it,” she said. “I would play the recording the whole day. My gosh, my family were in trouble, because I wouldn’t stop practicing and shouting.” Her parents allowed her to study music at university on the condition that she would switch back to an accountancy degree if singing didn’t work out.She started making a name for herself in South Africa while still a student at the University of Cape Town, and in 2011, Yende graduated from the Young Artists program at the Accademia at the Teatro alla Scala, in Milan, Italy, and began entering opera competitions.“The very first opera competition that I did was in Vienna, Austria, where I won everything possible,” she remembered. “They called my name so many times I was like, ‘No, God please let this one go to someone else.’ I felt unworthy … hearing the kind of finesse that my peers had.”Her career took off internationally in 2013, with her debut at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Yende has since interpreted roles in Puccini’s “La Bohème,” Mozart’s “The Marriage of Figaro” and Rossini’s “Le comte Ory,” while performing in major opera houses in Milan, Paris and London.Yende’s career has involved a number of firsts, including becoming the “first Black person to have a new production of ‘La Traviata’ in Opera Garnier in Paris,” in a production conceived especially for her, according to an interview with Observer.It has not been all plain sailing. She continues to address the question of opera’s Eurocentrism, and hopes to use her fame and talent as an opportunity to break stereotypes.“The biggest challenge has always been being the different one in the room. When I was the first Black in the Accademia of La Scala it was a bit uncomfortable,” she remembered.“Sometimes I would enter the rehearsal room, and I could see in the room looks like, ‘Why are you here?’ And I would just smile. But once I start making music, all of us in that room agreed that I’m not there by mistake.”Opera has featured strongly in the life of King Charles, who is a patron of over a dozen musical organizations. In 1981, when the then-prince married the late Princess Diana, Kiri Te Kanawa, an opera singer from New Zealand,  performed at the wedding. On May 6, the program will also feature performances from bass-baritone Bryn Terfel and baritone Roderick Williams.The coronation will not be the first time King Charles has watched Yende perform; he saw the soprano sing at the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra’s 75th anniversary gala, held at Windsor Castle in April 2022.Nevertheless, the invite to the coronation is a rare honor. “It’s historic, it’s generational,” Yende said.She will perform “Sacred Fire,” a new work by classical and film composer Sarah Class that Buckingham Palace has said “evokes a bridge between the angelic and human realms” with its imagery from the Bible.“It’s a vision of the freedom and protection of all beings, and of the abundance and beauty of our natural world,” said Class in a statement.Over 26 million Britons watched Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral and more than 20 million people in the UK tuned in to watch her coronation in 1953, according to the BBC.For the new King this is a defining moment: a historic spectacle, but also an opportunity to reinforce the Crown’s relationship with the British people and the Commonwealth.There has been opposition from some who argue that someone from one of Britain’s former colonies should not be singing at the coronation, but Yende is unperturbed.“My gift is a place where … people from all walks of life are able to find a place of healing, and reconciliation to move forward into the future,” she said.There will be many millions watching the coronation from around the world, including Yende’s family in Mpumalanga. It will be a historic moment for the continent, but most importantly it will be a cherished occasion for the singer who so nearly became an accountant.“I have feelings of excitement and joy for this upcoming engagement, just like any other,” she says. “I’m preparing and really looking forward to it.”",style,0.0
579,603,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/judy-blume-legacy-are-you-there-god-margaret-cec/index.html,Judy Blume’s books were formative for generations of readers. Here’s why they endure,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","When Pip Harry first got her period at 11, her mother handed her pads and a copy of Judy Blume’s “Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret.”The seminal coming-of-age novel, which tells the story of sixth grader Margaret Simon who’s anxious for her body to mature and conflicted about religion, has been a cultural touchstone for generations of girls and women. Harry’s mother read it when it was first published in 1970 before sharing it with preteen Harry in the ’80s. The book’s straightforward account of puberty felt radical, and Harry breezed through the whole book in one sitting.“It was a very frank portrayal of what it was like to be a teenager,” Harry, who lives in Sydney and is now a young adult author, said during a phone interview.A few years ago, Harry decided to reread the novel – this time with her own 11-year-old daughter. Harry was struck by how strong the voice of protagonist Margaret was, and while her daughter was put off by some plot points around bullying and gender roles, she thought the book was sweet and could relate to Margaret’s spiritual uncertainty.Kelly Fremon Craig’s film adaptation of “Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret” hits US theaters this weekend, transporting longtime fans back to their childhoods and introducing a whole new crop of young people to Blume’s perceptive characters.“Margaret” isn’t the only Blume title being adapted for our screens. Her adult novel “Summer Sisters” is set to become a Hulu limited series, the children’s classic “Superfudge” is being adapted into an animated film for Disney+ and the young adult novel “Forever” is being reimagined for Netflix. Meanwhile, “Judy Blume Forever,” a documentary that explores author’s life and impact on pop culture, was released last week on Amazon Prime Video.This Judy Blume renaissance is a testament to her enduring popularity. Her frank and straightforward portrayals of young people have captivated the attention of countless readers. Her books have sold more than 90 million copies globally. And though a lot has changed for young people in the decades since beloved titles such as “Margaret,” “Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing” and “Tiger Eyes” first hit shelves, kids and teenagers are still reaching for her books.What set Blume’s work apart was the way in which she spoke to the questions and concerns of young people. She pulled no punches when it came to the awkward and uncomfortable. And she signaled to kids that it was okay to have questions, even if grown-ups didn’t want them to have the answers.The honesty in her writing was personal – she knew what it was like to have key information withheld.“I was an anxious child. I felt adults kept secrets from the kids,” Blume says in “Judy Blume Forever.” “I hated those secrets.”Her books laid everything bare. Along with tackling menstruation in “Margaret,” Blume referenced masturbation in “Deenie” and wet dreams in “Then Again, Maybe I Won’t.” She explored teenagers having sex for the first time in “Forever.” But there was more to her books than these titillating tidbits. “Margaret” is ultimately about a girl wrestling with her belief in God, while “Tiger Eyes” is about a girl coping with the unexpected death of her father.“She just put it on the page when a lot of people were not,” Harry said.The same candor that endeared readers to Blume’s writing also made her books targets of censorship and outrage. Her novels faced frequent challenges and bans through the ’80s and ‘90s, and as recently as March, a Florida school district removed “Forever” from shelves.Young people often turned to Blume for information they weren’t getting from their parents. Deborah Beckwin, who read many of Blume’s novels growing up in Alabama in the ’80s and ‘90s, recalls asking her mother about sex on one occasion and coming away unsatisfied. Her parents were medical professionals and gave her some information about what it meant to get her period, but the unspoken understanding was that sex was something to be avoided – something she attributes in part to her evangelical upbringing.Blume’s books gave Beckwin the context she was looking for, and she now considers the author one of her “literary aunties.”“If you’re lucky, you’ll have the cool auntie who’s gonna give you the skinny – who’s gonna give you straight dope about stuff that your parents feel weird to talk about,” she said. “I’m sure she was like that for millions of kids.”V.T. Nayani feels similarly. Nayani, a filmmaker who grew up in Toronto as the daughter of Sri Lankan refugees, said her body developed earlier than many of her peers, but she didn’t feel like she could talk to anyone about it. Blume’s novels allowed her to explore some of her questions without judgment – and helped her understand there was nothing to be ashamed of.“It’s almost like I was in conversation with her characters privately, and I was able to have the conversations that I maybe was embarrassed or afraid to have in my friend circles,” she said.Thousands of children felt so seen by Blume that they wrote letters to her, asking the author their most burning questions and confiding in her. Often, Blume would write back. Those intimate correspondences, some of which are shared in “Judy Blume Forever,” capture just how comfortable so many kids felt opening up to her.“First of all, how do you know all our little secrets?” Lorrie Kim, who started writing to Blume at age 9 and is now an author herself, said in one of her letters. “In reading ‘Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret,’ I found that Margaret’s problems were very like my own, for my mother is Buddhist and my father Christian. Also, I am not yet growing, and several of my fourth grade classmates wear bras.”With the endless entertainment options at our fingertips now, it might seem surprising that kids still delight in Blume’s stories.Her low-stakes tales about an older sibling exasperated by a rambunctious little brother (“Tales of A Fourth Grade Nothing”) or an imaginative 10-year-old girl in post-WWII Florida (“Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself”) can feel relatively quaint today. But they still resonate, said Lessa Kanani’opua Pelayo-Lozada, president of the American Library Association.“As a children’s librarian and as a teen librarian, I’ve seen the enduring allure and love of Judy Blume,” she said. “Those same kinds of experiences that I related to (in ‘Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing’) all still ring true with children today, and I think that just speaks to Judy Blume’s writing, as well as her understanding of the experience of life.”Perla Lozoya, a fourth grade teacher in El Paso, Texas, sees this every year when she reads Blume’s “Fudge” series with her class. Her students “absolutely love” the books, which take place in a world not unlike our own. But unexpected events keep readers on their toes – the characters swallow turtles and get trapped in elevators, and pet birds utter catchphrases like “bonjour, stupid!”Blume’s vibrant characters and zany scenarios, along with her conversational prose, succeed in engaging even those students who otherwise haven’t shown an interest in books, Lozoya said.“Her books have made a lot of my students fall in love with reading,” she added.Whether you’re a Judy Blume superfan or whether you’ve never read her books, you’ve likely felt her influence on pop culture.There are numerous books, TV shows and films today that capture what it’s like to be a young person in all its tenderness and uncertainty. It was Blume who blazed the trail, said Davina Pardo, who co-directed the documentary “Judy Blume Forever,” in a conversation over Zoom. Blume’s characters talked openly about periods and female sexual pleasure, and expressed thoughts both mundane and profound. The way she depicted the interior lives of girls was revolutionary.“That has led to a whole slew of work by all kinds of creators where the girls’ experience matters,” Pardo said.Those creators include YA author Mary H.K. Choi, “Girls” creator Lena Dunham and PEN15 co-creator Anna Konkle – several writers featured in “Judy Blume Forever” – who nod to Blume as an inspiration. Blume also paved the way for writers like Alex Gino and Jason Reynolds, who center the experiences of queer and Black children (and whose books face challenges and bans today).Harry, the Sydney-based young adult author, said Blume has also had an enormous influence on her career. Blume’s fearlessness in addressing periods inspired Harry to write more openly about menstruation in her novel “Are You There, Buddha?,” which is a direct homage to “Margaret.” But in Harry’s novel, the main character considers newer products like period underwear and menstrual cups and begs Buddha for her period to not arrive. Her protagonist is also deeply concerned by climate change, like many young people today.“I’m trying to reflect what it is actually like to be a young person in today’s society,” Harry said.Society has changed since Blume’s most popular novels were first published – some of those changes can be seen in newer editions of “Margaret,” which reference pads and “Tampax” instead of sanitary belts. But there are some things that haven’t changed – feeling like your parents don’t understand you, feeling insecure around your peers, wondering whether your worries are normal.Blume may not have imagined that young people would still be reading her books so many years later. But as Reynolds puts it in “Judy Blume Forever,” she didn’t have to.“I think she wrote her books to be timely,” he said. “And they were so timely that they became timeless.”Top image: Books written by Judy Blume, at her bookstore in Key West, Florida, in January 2023.Watch: Judy Blume Forever (2023)Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok offer a look back at Judy Blume’s life and career, from her correspondences with young readers to her battles against censorship.

Gone were the requests for attendees to wear grand robes or ceremonial attire in favor of a more relaxed, pared down look.Members of the royal family, however, arrived in traditional regalia. The Prince of Wales wore a ceremonial dress uniform of the Welsh guards, while the Princess of Wales looked resplendent in official robes — worn over an Alexander McQueen ivory silk crepe dress peppered with silver bullion embroidered roses, thistles, daffodils and shamrock motifs symbolizing the different nations of the United Kingdom.According to CNN royal experts Max Foster and Lauren Moorhouse, Kate was also wearing a pair of drop-pearl earrings set in diamonds, once belonging to Princess Diana, as well as a lavish silver bullion laurel-shaped headpiece by Jess Collett and Alexander McQueen.The esteemed British designer is a fan favorite of the Wales’. Sarah Burton, the creative director of Alexander McQueen since 2010, custom created Kate’s striking wedding dress in 2011. At the coronation this morning, Princess Charlotte was similarly sporting McQueen — matching her mother in a white silk crepe look and identical satin floral embroidery, as well as a similar silver headpiece.The Queen Consort’s outfit had a nod to tradition while incorporating more modern and personal touches. Upon arriving at the Abbey, Camilla wore a crimson velvet and ermine Robe of State. Underneath, her ivory, silver and gold embroidered coronation dress was by British designer Bruce Oldfield.First Lady Jill Biden wore periwinkle blue Ralph Lauren skirt suit accessorized with a coordinating hair bow and was accompanied by her granddaughter Finnegan Biden in a chic pale yellow cape dress by Markarian, in what could be seen as a sartorial nod to show solidarity with Ukraine. Inside the Abbey, the pair were seated next to Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska in an icy blue dress and coat pairing.British actor and “Love Actually” star Emma Thompson arrived at the ceremony in a monochrome red rose-printed overcoat from Emilia Wickstead, accessorized with her Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) medal.Thompson, who has been known to subvert royal dress codes after she received her MBE award at Buckingham Palace in 2018 in a pair of Stella McCartney for Stan Smith trainers, was seen outside Westminster Abbey this morning in a more opulent type of footwear: Roger Vivier black satin pumps with a crystal heel and buckle.Elsewhere, Australian musician Nick Cave looked chic in a classic three-piece black suit and Gucci horsebit loafers, while Katy Perry (scheduled to headline the coronation concert in Windsor on Sunday) opted for a pink skirt suit and pearl choker by Vivienne Westwood — the late British designer who died in December 2022.The distinctive necklace design may also be a nod to Queen Camilla’s own fashion legacy. Camilla has numerous three-strand pearl pieces, including the aquamarine piece she has worn consistently since the 1990s.Perry was accompanied by British Vogue editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, who arrived in a statement icy blue waistcoat and polka dot tie.Next to arrive were world leaders, politicians, and international members of government. Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau was spotted braving the rain on his way to Westminster Abbey. His wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau cut through the gray weather with a blush-toned satin Ted Baker dress complete with organza sleeves. Akshata Sunak, wife of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak — who arrived in a classic morning suit — opted for a similarly uplifting cornflower blue puff-sleeved dress by Claire Mischevani.  Lady Louise Windsor received seasonal the memo, too, with her meadow-flower couture dress from Suzannah London.Princess Anne appeared in military uniform heavy with gold braid to perform her role as “Gold Stick in Waiting” responsible for the monarch’s personal safety. No stranger to a military uniform, Anne is colonel of several international regiments.Across the event, international royalty used the moment to celebrate their country’s traditional garments. Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko of Japan appeared in a morning suit and muted patterned silk kimono with an obi belt respectively.The theme of traditional dress was continued by King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema of Bhutan. King Jigme Khesar wore a Bhutanese Gho, while Queen Jetsun Pema wore a lilac-colored kira — a customary wrap dress typical in Bhutan.There were an array of jewel-toned looks on display, too. There were an array of jewel-toned looks on display, too. Often heralded as one of the world’s best dressed royals, Queen Letizia of Spain didn’t disappoint, stepping out in a custom, amethyst-hued Carolina Herrera pink suit complete with ruffles and embroidered details.Similarly, Masenate Mahot Seeiso — Queen of Lesotho, seen arriving with Lesotho’s King Letsie III — opted for an arresting, sapphire-blue paisley gown with a sculptural, off-the-shoulder bodice. South African soprano Pretty Yende wore a striking sunny yellow Stéphane Rolland gown, finished off with a 138 carat yellow and white diamond necklace by Graff and 35 carat white diamond earrings.Top image:  Katy Perry during the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla in Westminster Abbey.",style,0.0

The monarchy is an institution where impartiality, political neutrality and professionalism are to be maintained at all costs, even in clothing, lest hemlines, color palettes and even silhouettes become ciphers waiting to be cracked. Was Diana really seeking revenge when she wore an off-the-shoulder black cocktail dress back in 1994? Did the late Queen Elizabeth II subtly show support for the European Union in a conveniently colored blue and yellow hat? Was Harry’s admission of shopping in TK Maxx (the British equivalent to TJ Maxx) intended to make him more endearing to the masses?But one member of the royal family has so far succeeded in maintaining a low sartorial profile, even as her distinctive personal style has undergone a significant shift. King Charles’ wife, Camilla — who on May 6 will become the 29th Queen Consort crowned at Westminster Abbey in London — has honed her public image in part using the soft power of fashion. From country casuals like puffer coats, knitted sweaters and linen summer skirts to more regal looks in velvet, suede and satin, Camilla’s style evolution is a tale of two halves: Before royal engagements and after, though she has long loved fashion.

Prince Charles, the then 30-year-old eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II — and future King — was touring the state on behalf of his mother.As he finished his regular 6.30 a.m. swim, Charles was intercepted by Jane Priest, a bikini-clad 26-year-old model who giggled as she placed her hands on the bashful royal’s shoulders and, to his surprise, planted a kiss on his cheek.The “Bond” moment — which was caught on camera — was not as spontaneous as it may first appear. In a 2013 documentary, royal photographer Kent Gavin admitted to asking Priest to “run up and kiss” Charles to create a photo opportunity.But in a 2012 interview with London’s Evening Standard newspaper, Priest explained how the rendezvous, intended to “make Charles more accessible,” did not go exactly as planned.“When he saw me, he dived into the water, so I thought I’d follow him in, but as I went in, he got out,” Priest told the newspaper. “So I followed him out, hair ruined, make-up ruined, and I felt like such an idiot. I actually went and put my hands on his chest to give him a kiss and Charles said: ‘No, I can’t touch you, I can’t touch you.’”Nevertheless, the photo opportunity — which was heralded as showing the transformation of a once awkward young man into a desirable prince — certainly made waves, appearing on front pages across the globe. It remains one of the rare occasions a British prince has been photographed in swimwear, and certainly in such short shorts.In recent years, men’s micro-shorts have enjoyed something of a renaissance. No longer considered a sartorial taboo, viral street-style snaps of actors Paul Mescal and Milo Ventimiglia have demonstrated that short-shorts deserve to become a summer staple once again. In 2020, a public demand for more men in 5” inseam shorts swept TikTok with hundreds of dedicated videos — today the phrase boasts over 52 million views.The 1979 image also bestowed overnight fame on Priest, then a young mother of one, who went on to have a successful modeling and television career. “Here was one of the most powerful men in the world and he was absolutely adorable,” she recalled to the Evening Standard. “I was totally overawed for those couple of minutes.”Sign up for CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what’s happening behind palace walls.",style,0.0

It’s about showing how selective cancel culture is within liberal politics, in the most blatant way so far.”She added that “slippery tactics and double standards like this” contribute to an erosion of trust toward liberals.Jamil, whose body positivity Instagram account “I Weigh” has more than a million followers, previously criticized the Met Gala in October, calling the theme a “disappointing double standard” in the industry and pointing out that Lagerfeld’s comments were recent.",style,0.0
585,609,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/remember-when-prince-butt-suit-1991-vma/index.html,Remember when Prince bared his butt at the 1991 VMAs?,2023-05-03 10:17:00,"It was a performance that pushed the boundaries of live television, not least because of the writhing, semi-naked dancers and Romanesque colonnades aflame. But all the pyrotechnics and simulated sex were eclipsed by a sight more shocking still — Prince’s butt, bared for all to see amid a tangle of lemon yellow lace.The full moon moment occurred at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, during a performance of the track “Get Off. ” Like a pair of frosted windows, Prince’s pert derrière was framed in a pair of high-waisted cutout pants, which the singer paired with a matching tailored bolero jacket and pumps. It was a shock for everyone watching — at home and in the studio. “The camera seemed embarrassed,” reported the Chicago Tribune of the performance, “constantly cutting away to avoid whichever lurid scene it was stumbling across.”That shock factor has waned over time. During the 2010s, in particular, cheeky moments popped up in many a pop star’s performances. High-cut, butt-baring thong bodysuits were a mainstay in Miley Cyrus’ wardrobe during her 2014 “Bangerz” tour. In 2019, Lizzo’s VMA set featured a giant inflatable peachy posterior while her backup dancers bent over in an array of assless chaps.But according to Stacia Lang — Prince’s costume designer between 1990 and 1993 — the controversial pants actually offered less exposure than they appeared. In the latest episode of “The Prince Mixtape,” a CNN podcast dedicated to the American music icon and his legacy, Lang explained that she used a thin, net-like fabric called marquisette to suggest exposed buttocks. “There was a beautiful, white, pure, really heavy French lace that we took right away to the dyers and had that dyed bright citron yellow,” she said.  “And also (the dyer) had to dye up several fabrics that would create the illusion that his rear end was showing.”It was also one of two design ideas Lang put forward to Prince, who she recalls opting for the more conservative option. “It was just funny because he crossed out with a graphite pencil the one with more exposure. And I thought, ‘Well, this is a guy with some modesty.’”But the result, according to Lang, was still electric. “There was a lot of buzz backstage,” she remembers. “George Michael was talking. I think so was Cindy Crawford. It was crazy because people just couldn’t believe that that happened.”Widely revered and consistently revisited, Prince’s sartorial reputation is today perhaps as fondly remembered as his music. But such a legacy isn’t created overnight. “His style was iconic,” said Marie France, the star’s costume designer in the 1980s, on the podcast. “But (at) the same time, I think, very elegant, not just bizarre.”According to Lang, the magic formula was his playfulness, immovable sense of self and admiration for the garment-making process. “His persona, his clothing meant so much to him,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons why I enjoyed being with him and working with him so much… And he respected what we did.”Listen now as “The Prince Mixtape” podcast explores how one of America’s music icons became the superstar we know today.",style,0.0
586,610,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/met-gala-2023-trains-trend/index.html,Extravagant trains pulled up at this year’s Met Gala,2023-05-03 03:47:00,"At the Met Gala in New York City last night, celebrities pulled out all the stops to honor the late designer Karl Lagerfeld, the focus of the Costume Institute’s spring exhibition “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.”Among the A-Listers in attendance, trends included a focus on florals (such as Chanel’s classic camellia) and fans (an accessory favored by Lagerfeld), as well as riffs on suiting, tweed and a classic black-and-white color palette. There was also a series of increasingly elaborate trains coating the red carpet — each serving as a fashion moment and a shrewd sartorial move, perhaps, by guaranteeing their wearer space to breathe (and pose!) among their peers.Actor Jeremy Pope (pictured above) had perhaps the most notable and on-theme trains — his custom Balmain cape, which featured Lagerfeld’s profile in black and white, swept the floor at 10 meters (nearly 33 feet) long, according to the fashion house’s Instagram. The garment necessitated more than 5,000 meters (over 16,400 feet) of silk chiffon and 70 seamstresses.Arriving fashionably late, Rihanna closed out the red carpet in a silky white custom Valentino gown that served as a homage to the bridal looks that often closed out Lagerfeld’s Chanel shows. The look, according to Valentino’s Instagram, included a 5-meter (16.4-foot) train and silk faille cape with 30 camellia flowers.Honoring Lagerfeld’s personal style and vintage Chanel corsets, “Wednesday” star Jenna Ortega’s custom Thom Browne look highlighted “disrupted precision and deconstructed tailoring,” according to a press release.Ortega wore a cropped black chiffon tweed jacket with a matching coat draped over a black beaded tulle mini pannier skirt. The jacket and skirt were also embroidered with gold bullion and pearl chains.Glenn Close, meanwhile, stunned in a sequined Erdem Eau de Nil gown. Erdem Moralioglu, creative director of the brand, designed the dress with Lagerfeld in mind: The crystal embroidery was inspired by the haphazardly-draped jewelry featured in Lagerfeld’s first Haute Couture show for Chanel in 1983, according to Erdem’s Instagram.The floor-spanning cape was influenced by model Devon Aoki’s look in a subsequent couture show from 1999. And the collar and cuffs were odes to Lagerfeld’s signature look.Rita Ora and Gigi Hadid donned similar dark and sultry looks for the event. Ora wore an Atelier Prabal Gurung black silk tulle gown that featured a long chiffon skirt with multiple hand-embroidered silk organza and satin flowers — and accessorizing with foot-long chains attached to her nails. Hadid’s Givenchy by Matthew Williams gown was “inspired by some of Karl’s favorite things,” Williams said during Vogue’s livestream from the carpet, citing fans and florals.“Karl was always looking forward and not so nostalgic, so we wanted to make something new and also that spoke to the craftsmanship of the Atelier Givenchy,” Williams added.And Florence Pugh debuted both a new buzz cut hairdo and a custom Valentino gown. “For the event, the face of the Maison … made her entrance in a white silk taffeta backless dress with a black silk chiffon bow detail, designed especially for her using 64 meters of silk,” the house said in an Instagram post. “To go along with the look, Florence wore a Valentino black feather crown.”",style,0.0

The British model and actor arrived at the after-party for the 2023 Met Gala in honor of fashion powerhouse Karl Lagerfeld in full Lagerfeld cosplay.The look, which came complete with a white feather wig, was a more playful rendition of the evening’s theme. Wearing a strapless black Karl Lagerfeld dress, a floating white shirt collar and cuffs, as well as the designer’s signature fingerless leather gloves, Delevingne’s outfit straddled costume and couture.In recent years, celebrities have revived public interest in the after-party — proving it is anything but an afterthought. The rules are a little looser, the cameras fewer, and in recent years: the outfits more exciting. It’s the perfect place for an A-lister to slip into something more comfortable, whether that means shorter, softer, or even sillier. Janelle Monae arrived in a bikini, while Billie Eilish wore a New York Knicks cap and a tracksuit. An outfit too uncouth for the red carpet? Save it for the after-party, the not-so-secret realm where celebrities can let their hair down — or stuff it into a fun wig.Nailing Lagerfeld’s shock of white hair was of great importance for Delevingne, who was a close friend and muse to the designer for a decade. Her feathered wig was a custom piece by stylists Anthony Perez and Danielle Priano and  took over six hours to create, as each faux feather (made from silk) was hand-sewn on. At the Met Gala, her homage was less obvious —choosing an enveloping white shirt cape and black aviator sunglasses,  alongside a gray tousled wig as a nod to the late Lagerfeld.“(There’s been) a lot of emotions,” she told Vogue at the event, “honestly, I cried on the way here a little bit… I owe him so much and it’s an amazing way to remember him.”",style,0.0
588,612,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/kim-kardashian-pearls-met-gala-2023-kylie-kendall/index.html,Kim Kardashian is ‘dripping in pearls’ with lustrous Lagerfeld tribute at Met Gala,2023-05-02 06:33:00,"As a nod to late designer Karl Lagerfeld’s penchant for pearls, Kim Kardashian’s Met Gala look was drenched in them.“I thought, ‘What is more Karl?’ You know, the iconic Chanel pearls is what I always thought of. So we wanted to just be dripping in pearls,” Kardashian said of her custom Schiaparelli ensemble on Vogue’s livestream from the red carpet in New York Monday night. (Technically, the carpet was more of a rich cream color.)Numerous strands of pearls laid atop a tan corset, with more still functioning as Kardashian’s full-length skirt. While it was widely-praised as an elegant example of a trend prevalent among the Gala’s invitees, some social media users compared the look to the near-naked photoshoot Kardashian partook in during the first season of her reality show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”Members of the Kardashian-Jenner family have been Met Gala mainstays in recent years. At last year’s event, Kardashian made headlines when she wore the dress Marilyn Monroe wore when she sang “Happy Birthday” to President John F. Kennedy in 1962. Her 2021 Met Gala look wasn’t any less provocative; she wore a “faceless” Balenciaga gown that completely covered her in black from head to toe.This year, Kardashian’s half-sisters Kylie and Kendall Jenner were also in attendance. Kylie wore a bright red custom Jean Paul Gaultier gown under an oversized red and baby blue coat, both pieces from designer Haider Ackermann.Kendall — who walked on Lagerfeld’s Chanel runways on multiple occasions — glittered in a black sequin Marc Jacobs leotard with floor-length sleeves and knee-high boots.“Karl’s been a hero of mine since I was 17 years old looking at Chloe collections,” Jacobs said on Vogue’s livestream during a later interview.“He was like, to me, the true fashion designer,” Jacobs said of Lagerfeld’s “unbridled creativity” and disregard for limitations.",style,0.0
589,613,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/icon-3d-printing-architecture-initiative-99-project-olympus-spc-intl-scn/index.html,"A 3D-printing company is preparing to build on the lunar surface. But first, a moonshot at home","01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","Jason Ballard, the CEO and co-founder of 3D printing architecture company ICON, doesn’t mince his words. “There are certain people who are content to build a really ugly or uninspiring world,” he said. “We’re not. The day I walk outside and see something ugly being built by one of my robots – that’s a nightmare scenario for me.”Ballard, a quick-talking Texan in a 10-gallon hat, has a vision for the future of architecture.  Others are buying into it. Since launching in 2017, Austin-based ICON has received close to half a billion dollars in funding, won a contract with NASA and paired up with influential architects like Bjarke Ingels. If all goes according to plan, ICON will be building on the moon before the end of the decade.But first, the CEO wanted to discuss a moonshot much closer to home.ICON made its name creating houses using a high strength concrete it calls “Lavacrete,” printed in layers to form walls. A large machine ICON named the “Vulcan” does the printing, fed by an on-site mixing system dubbed “Magma.”The company’s first house was unveiled in 2018, and since then its operations have scaled up, from a collection of six homes in 2020 to a 100-home community north of Austin currently under construction (the largest printed community in the US). At each stage, the footprint of properties has increased, from 350 square feet to over 2,000 square feet, as the technology has advanced and 3D-printed homes have moved from prototype to novelty to relatively mainstream.A thread running through ICON’s work is building homes for disadvantaged people, including accommodation for the long-term homeless, often in collaboration with non-profits. Creating affordable housing is also an objective, which led the company to launch design competition Initiative 99 last month.Initiative 99 seeks submissions for homes that can be 3D-printed for $99,000 or less. Ballard described it as “a call to arms for the global architecture and design community” to get to grips with “one of the most pressing industries in need of a rethink.”A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2021 found about half of Americans reported affordable housing was a “major problem” in their area. One estimate from late 2020 calculated the US had a housing supply deficit of 3.8 million units.Peggy Bailey is vice president of housing and income security at progressive US think tank the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Bailey explained that in the US, many people struggle to pay for their accommodation. “Even before the pandemic and economic downturn, 23 million people lived in 11 million low-income households that paid more than 50% of their income for rent,” she told CNN via email.“Innovative ways to build housing are a promising step toward creating more affordable housing,” she added, while cautioning, “the housing affordability crisis isn’t due to a single issue or event. Multifaceted problems require multifaceted solutions.”The idea for Initiative 99 came from an internal exercise ICON has run every six months for the past five years, to see what can be constructed for $99,000 with the technology available. “This year we hit an inflection point,” said Ballard. “The results were very compelling. It immediately dawned on all of us (that) we’ve got to tell everybody about this.”The ICON CEO said Initiative 99’s $1 million prize fund will be the largest ever for an affordable housing competition. The competition will launch on May 23 and run for a year, with stages for concept development, schematic design and design development. There will be multiple winners and their designs will be built by ICON.Ballard hopes the competition receives entries tailored to meet cultures and contexts around the world, addressing specific needs and challenges.Bailey suggested the success of 3D-printed housing could hinge on how it is perceived by prospective residents. “One thing to keep in mind with any innovation in housing development, including 3D-development … is that the housing must fit in the rental market and be of the quality and style that any person would want to live in,” she said.Ballard said all ICON’s projects feed into one another: for example, the systems monitoring and support software it will use in the Initiative 99 homes was developed as part of its Project Olympus initiative, which is investigating building 3D-printed structures on the moon.Lunar concept designs, created in collaboration with Bjarke Ingles Group, were released in 2020, and in November 2022 ICON was awarded a $57 million contract by NASA, which will culminate in testing on the moon.Instead of Lavacrete, ICON is experimenting with using lunar regolith, the mineral-rich dust and rock that covers the moon’s surface. The regolith can be melted with a laser and turned into a ceramic-like material that is hard, durable and radiation-absorbing, explained Ballard.Parts of the construction system have been tested in a vacuum, and will next be tested in simulated lunar gravity, before being sent to the moon in 2026 or 2027, he added. The CEO stressed there are no plans for a lunar base yet, but ICON’s tests will represent a significant step in that direction.Some of ICON’s lunar ideas could find a civilian context too. Ballard is conscious that Lavacrete contains cement, which has a large carbon footprint, and said that ICON is researching ways to utilize locally sourced building materials on Earth that can compete with concrete.Patti Harburg-Petrich, principal at engineering consultancy Buro Happold, noted that some companies are already printing with materials other than concrete. The firm consulted on Mighty Buildings’ award-winning Mighty House, in California, which utilized prefabricated, 3D-printed composite stone material for its walls.She argued there was a strong case for 3D-printing’s sustainability credentials. “Oftentimes 3D-printed homes can be built faster and more sustainably when compared to traditional construction,” Harburg-Petrich said via email, pointing to a reduction in building materials wasted in construction.In recent years, there has been growing ambition around 3D-printing. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D-printing technology by 2030, and the city is home to the world’s largest 3D-printed structure by volume – a two-story local government office built by Apis Cor in 2019.The first multi-story 3D-printed building in the US was unveiled in September 2022, and the tallest 3D-printed building in the world is a 9.9 meter (32.5 foot), three-story house in Saudi Arabia, completed last November – both realized using printing technology by Danish company COBOD.Ballard says ICON is also planning to print multi-story buildings, and has triplex and quadplex designs in the works. ICON is developing the next generation of its Vulcan printing system, capable of building much bigger projects, Ballard said, adding that the company aims to eventually create a system in which three or four machines can be operated by a single person. “You should expect it to be a lot faster, you should expect it to be a lot more autonomous,” he added.This thinking comes as the design and construction sectors in the US face a skilled labor shortage, noted Harburg-Petrich. Along with more affordable and transportable 3D-printing systems, in the future, “we also need a workforce that is adaptable to 3D-printed construction technology,” she said.3D-construction at scale, with an emphasis on affordable housing, is where Ballard wants to take ICON. In the case of Initiative 99, the winning designs will be released for free, meaning anyone with the tools can create the houses themselves.“I feel like the future can be amazing,” said Ballard. “But I’m also haunted by this understanding of history and human behavior, because it’s not guaranteed to be amazing. We have to make it so. And we’re going to have to take some risks to make it so.”",style,0.0
590,614,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/marina-tabassum-architect-bangladesh-hnk-spc-intl/index.html,Meet the award-winning architect building flat-pack homes for flood victims,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","Among the stretching plains of Bangladesh’s river deltas, the Khudi Bari looks small.The two-story structure resembles a free-standing treehouse, with a pitched roof covering a platform that balances on spindly legs. Its name means “tiny house” in Bengali, and its thin bamboo frame looks frail against the rolling yellow fields and the swirling tides splashing against the river bank.While the humble dwelling looks fragile, it’s the landscape that is delicate. Along these river deltas, the map changes every few years, with riverbank erosion causing islands, known as chars, to rise and fall with the seasons.“A lot of people lose their land. A lot of towns have vanished into the water,” said Marina Tabassum.  The award-winning founder of Marina Tabassum Architects (MTA) wanted to find a solution for these landless people, who are frequently forced to move to escape flooding.“They need to move the moment the sand bed starts to vanish,” said Tabassum. “The idea was that they should be able to move with their structure.”Lightweight and modular, the Khudi Bari is designed to be folded down, packed up and relocated, while still able to withstand heavy wind and rain – a steady presence in a transitory lifestyle.Bangladesh is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change, and experiences severe monsoons and flooding for several months every year.“The coastal areas of Bangladesh, where we are facing the sea level rise and the changing biodiversity and ecology, those areas need a lot of attention,” said Tabassum.She and her team began researching the needs of these communities back in 2018, but it wasn’t until the pandemic hit – and many other projects ground to a halt – that they had time to fully explore the idea of what this temporary structure might look like.Working through a variety of ideas, the team chose bamboo as the principal material. Locally available, cheap, durable, and lightweight, it is easy to move and carry. Fastened with steel joints and metal corner braces for strength, the structure can be easily assembled and disassembled with minimal labor.Unlike many other temporary structures, the Khudi Bari has two levels. The ground floor is built on compact earth, and walls can be made with any locally found material, such as corrugated iron or woven bamboo, or it can be left open for agricultural storage. The second floor, which can sleep up to four people, is six feet from the ground and accessed by a stepladder, offering a safe space to shelter during flooding.Tabassum’s compassion for the landless perhaps comes from her own family history and upbringing. The grandchild of immigrants, Tabassum’s family hails from Malda, in West Bengal, India. They left their hometown during the Hindu-Muslim riots that began after partition in 1947 – and the war and famine of Bangladesh’s early years, after gaining independence in 1971, was the backdrop of Tabassum’s childhood.These early experiences have informed her architectural practice. “Architecture grows from the land, so if you want to root it in its place, then you have to have a deep understanding of where it’s located,” she said.Throughout her nearly three-decade career, she has designed some of the country’s most noted landmarks, including the Museum of Independence Monument, and the Aga Khan Award-winning Bait Ur Rouf Mosque.Tabassum said that during her university studies, the curriculum was filled with works designed by foreign architects – so she was determined to create “a language of architecture which is of Bengal, of Bangladesh.”Influenced by the work of late American architect Louis Kahn, and his student, Bangladeshi architect Muzharul Islam, Tabassum’s style is one of simplicity, playing with light and dark and the contrast of lines and shapes to create dynamic spaces that blend interiors with the natural world beyond.In addition to the Aga Khan Award in 2016, Tabassum’s work has been further recognized, winning the Soane Medal in 2021, and most recently, celebrated in a solo exhibition at the TUM Museum of Architecture in Munich.Her work focuses on local, historical materials, like red brick and bamboo – which has the additional benefit of reducing costs and carbon emissions associated with transport and the supply chain.Shying away from commercial projects, Tabassum takes inspiration from her father, who was the only doctor in the neighborhood where she grew up, and pursues architecture that supports the community, and responds to crisis and need.“I really love designing public projects, especially places where people gather,” she said. “A city and its health is defined by how good your public spaces are. That really contributes to the mental and physical health of the inhabitants – in that respect, I think we still have some way to go.”To facilitate the distribution and building of the Khudi Bari, Tabassum founded a non-profit branch of her firm called FACE (Foundation for Architecture, Community, Equity) that could help provide proper shelter and living conditions for marginalized groups such as climate refugees, nomadic communities, and low-income populations.In 2021, the Khudi Bari project received a grant from the Embassy of Switzerland in Bangladesh to fund its first 100 tiny houses, which cost roughly $450 each to build. Through community workshops and engagement events in rural communities, Tabassum said the team selects families who are “more deserving” of a new home.The beneficiaries range from widows trying to provide for their children, to those struggling to make ends meet because of lifelong disability. So far, FACE has built 40 of these tiny homes, in the southern coastal chars of Chandpur, as well as the northern, flood-prone communities of Kurigram and Sunamganj.“The idea is not to build the entire village,” said Tabassum. “We are building these houses to see how the buildings react to the climate, but at the same time, how people appropriate it.”FACE is not just building these tiny homes for the sand-shifting communities on the chars. On Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar, around one million Rohingya refugees live in Cox’s Bazaar. Refugee camps are not allowed to build permanent structures or lay foundations, so Tabassum’s team has adapted the modular Khudi Bari to create homes and community space there. “Everybody has a right to good architecture,” she added.“Because of the climate crisis, because of the sea level rise, and all the different unpredictable phenomena that are happening around us, it’s important to not create something too permanent,” Tabassum said. “I don’t believe that every building needs to last a hundred years.”“Architecture of people, where people live, it’s always been something which is a constantly evolving process,” she added. “It never sought permanence. And so it’s sort of ephemeral in its quality and its character.”",style,0.0
593,617,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/mary-quant-dies-scli-intl/index.html,British fashion designer Mary Quant dies age 93,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","British fashion designer Mary Quant, credited with turning the miniskirt into a worldwide phenomenon, has died age 93, her family announced in a statement via the PA news agency.Quant died peacefully at her home in Surrey, south of London, on Thursday morning, according to the statement.Her family called her “one of the most internationally recognised fashion designers of the 20th Century and an outstanding innovator.”Quant launched one of the first global super brands, shaping a new era in fashion. The miniskirt, named after the Mini Cooper, became a defining staple of the Swinging Sixties.For women who came of age wearing them, Quant’s designs represented freedom, empowerment, and the rejection of their parents’ aesthetic standards.Her clothes, as she made clear in Sadie Frost’s 2021 documentary “Quant” about her life, were not meant for an elite of “stately ladies,” but offered a colorful break from the stiff sartorial codes of the previous decade, including the polished style of Christian Dior’s first collection, “the New Look.”Whether Quant did in fact invent the miniskirt is a hotly debated topic – the documentary also mentions French designer André Courrèges as the possible creator of the garment. But she was responsible for turning the increasingly shorter skirt into the era-defining garment of the 1960s, breaking down social codes in the process.And Quant’s fashion empire stretched beyond the miniskirt, as she helped popularize other groundbreaking trends such as her very own Vidal Sassoon bob; the “Chelsea girl” coquettish aesthetic; Peter Pan collars; colorful tights, created to complement her bold and bright collections; her use of PVC for outerwear (something that previously had only been worn by fishermen); male knits repurposed as womens’ sweater dresses; and dress pockets.Alexandra Shulman, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, paid tribute to Quant Thursday, posting on Twitter: “RIP Dame Mary Quant. A leader of fashion but also in female entrepreneurship- a visionary who was much more than a great haircut.”Quant worked on the advisory council for London’s Victoria & Albert Museum from 1976 to 1978 where an exhibition of her work was held in 2019.The museum said in a statement Thursday: “It’s impossible to overstate Quant’s contribution to fashion. She represented the joyful freedom of 1960s fashion, and provided a new role model for young women.“Fashion today owes so much to her trailblazing vision.”",style,0.0

He had contributed to the magazine for more than 50 years.He pioneered some of the magazine’s most influential features, including “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions,” where a benign question leads to numerous unexpected sarcasms, or the Mad fold-in, the magazine’s inside back page, which when folded, cleverly turned one work into another previously hidden image.Started in 1964 to parody the glossy fold-outs of Playboy and National Geographic, the fold-in became a hit, and an influential symbol of mayhem.“A humble and kind creator, Al’s presence, his astute social commentary, and his endless amusement at life’s ups and downs shaped the fabric of the magazine,” Mad said in a statement Monday.“Al Jaffee was an incredibly gifted man who touched our hearts and never failed to make us laugh,” said Jim Lee, chief creative officer and Publisher of DC. “He garnered the highest accolades and praise in the world of illustrations and comics.”Jaffee collected several accolades for his clever parodies and satire throughout his long career, including Reuben Awards’ Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, awarded in 2008.He was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Society of Illustrators’ Hall of Fame in 2014, and an archive of his work is held at Columbia University, the magazine said.“Al was, at heart, a rascal,” said John Ficarra, former Mad editor-in-chief who worked with Jaffee for more than 35 years. “He always had a playful twinkle in his eye and brought that sensibility to everything he created.”Receiving his Guinness World Record in 2016 for the longest career as a comic artist, Jaffee said of his time at Mad Magazine: “There are so many things in this place that through the years I grew to love, the Mad staff in particular was very tough, but very fair and very good.“When they told me that something that I was doing was only working 90% and something has to be done about the other 10% it literally drove me crazy but I couldn’t argue with them because they were right. So it’s been one of the most pleasant trips I’ve been on and I didn’t have to check my luggage.”Former Mad art director Sam Viviano said in the magazine’s tribute on Monday that the cartoonist was revered and respected.“It was an event when Al would visit the Mad offices to drop off a Fold-In,” Viviano said. “The entire staff would gather for an hour just to listen to him talk about his amazing life and career.”Suzy Hutchinson, Mad’s current art director, added: “Al embodied the true spirit of Mad, and so many humorists, cartoonists and creatives will find inspiration in his work for generations to come.”“He was a national treasure, and it was an honor to work with and learn from such an ingenious, caring, and wholly creative soul, the best of the Original Gang of Idiots.”",style,0.0
597,621,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/male-pattern-baldness-experience-acceptance/index.html,The art of growing bald gracefully,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","There are three important days in every bald(ing) man’s life: The day you realize you’re losing your hair, the day you realize you should shave off what remains, and the day you finally do. Growing bald gracefully is about reducing the gap between these milestones as far as possible. I learned this the hard way.Before recounting my decade of denial and deceit, here are the bare-headed facts: I suffer from a type of baldness I call “the Prince William.” It combines an expanding circular patch on top (“the Friar Tuck”) and receding corners (“the Jude Law”). The two must eventually meet. Or, to put it another way: The bridge between my last strongholds of follicle activity has grown ever thinner, my hairline drifting apart like two continental landmasses. What once resembled Pangaea is now little more than a footbridge over the Bering Strait.My mother was the first to notice this tectonic shift. “You’re thinning,” she observed, hovering over my then-25-year-old self at the family table. It seemed fitting that the woman who delivered me into this world should also discover my first sign of aging. After all, losing your hair is coming to terms with the possibility of looking like a big baby again. (Although my mom recently confirmed via WhatsApp that I had a full head of hair at birth. “I don’t do bald babies,” she added, unhelpfully.)What followed will be familiar to men around the world. Realization is a creeping process of denial eroded by moments of shock and, later, resignation. Denial was believing that what wasn’t in the mirror (namely a birds-eye view of my head) didn’t exist. Shock was encountering a photo of myself, taken from above, and wondering, ‘Who’s that balding guy standing exactly where I was?’ Resignation was seeing an acquaintance across a bar, his greasy comb-over fooling only himself, and muttering to my wife: “Just don’t let me get like him.”I almost did. Another five years would pass until I conceded defeat. I moved to Hong Kong and found a miracle barber who proved that coolness isn’t a hairstyle alone. A budding breakdancer (and bald by choice: hair is something of an impediment to head-spinning), he was adept at arranging my remaining locks in a way that maintained the illusion.We had an unspoken understanding. But when I moved again last year, my attempts to explain his magic to new hair stylists became increasingly embarrassing. It felt like I was making them accomplices in my deception. “Just make it look… better?” I’d say, before removing my glasses and hoping what emerged would sustain me for another month or three. Successive barbers played along. But I, too, was fooling only myself.Instagram’s algorithms discovered my situation and began populating my feed with clips of extreme toupée makeovers. Hints from loved ones were even less subtle — like when my wife returned from a work trip brandishing a gift, only to reveal a bottle of UV-protective scalp spray. Who said romance is dead?In the meantime, I began making self-deprecating jokes and became more comfortable discussing my fate. Invariably, friends offered the same three condolences in reply: 1) That “at least” I can grow a beard, 2) that I have a “good-shaped head,” whatever that means, and 3) that, if I’m lucky, I might end up resembling the universal gold standard of attractive bald White dudes: Bruce Willis.If you find yourself reassuring a balding man that he looks like Bruce Willis, I promise you he’s heard it many times before. It is reassuring, nonetheless.As your hair thins, small clumps start sticking out in new and unexpected directions. Human hairs crave company — and when their neighbors depart, they don’t know where to go.I’d spend cumulative hours trying to convince individual strands to stick back down. Then one winter morning, as I fussed over a group of errant strays, a moment of clarity: I had grown more insecure about my hair than what lurked beneath.That evening I purchased clippers, took them to the bathroom and unceremoniously gave myself the only hairstyle I’ll have for the rest of my life. A full 10 years after diagnosis, male pattern baldness had secured its final victory. A chapter of my youth ended in a pile of limp offcuts on the shower floor.My wife told me I look much better than before. But she has to say that. My editor meanwhile assured me that I look more “athletic,” (indeed, my streamlined form may have knocked a few seconds off my swim time). Other benefits, I told myself, include quicker post-shower drying, no money spent on haircuts and time saved getting ready each morning.Soon after completing the deed, I sent a selfie to my friend Anton. “Welcome to the sexy zone, comrade,” he wrote back.Anton was the first among my friends to go bald. While I had the luxury of holding out until aged 35, he was an angst-prone 18 when he first found clumps of hair on the pillow. The denial phase lasted only until his early 20s, when it was shattered at a theater workshop by a teacher who instructed the class to “tilt over until you can see Anton’s bald spot.” He then performed what Anton described as a “little tap on the top of my head.”“I was like, ‘What the f**k?’” he recalled over Zoom. “I didn’t say it, but I felt assaulted. Not only because he tapped me on the head, but because I didn’t even know I was bald! That was the first I’d heard about it.”He soon found looking at photos of himself depressing. He too was assured that “at least” he had a beard and a “good-shaped head” — again, whatever that means. Someone told him he looked like Jason Statham, who is just the British equivalent to Willis. For Anton, going bald was “a very lonely” experience, especially at such a young age.“There is something especially isolating about something happening to you that is socially acceptable to laugh at,” he said. “There wasn’t a sense of anyone feeling anything other than, ‘Sucks to be you.’”For the record, Anton looks great bald — and I’m not just returning his compliment. Unlike me, he’s got some muscle on him. As a boxing instructor, he suits the skinhead look. In a 2012 study, which I cite simply because I approve of the results, University of Pennsylvania researchers found that images of men with their hair digitally removed were perceived to be “more dominant, taller and stronger” when compared to the original photographs.“Holding on to your hair is a lot less attractive than just getting rid of it,” Anton said. “You can look sharper. You just change the image of yourself in your mind’s eye, then you suddenly appreciate it for a different aesthetic value.“It’s taken me 35 years, but now I’m very fond of how I look,” he added. “I got to a point where I realized any criticism of my appearance isn’t based on anything other than an impression of what other people might think.”I am not massively worried about being considered less attractive. Nor am I concerned about looking older or being called a “slaphead,” as we’re disparagingly known in Britain. It’s the loss of identity I struggle with.My hairless head will, forever more, be my distinguishing physical attribute. To strangers I am now, officially, “that bald guy.” Who ordered the lasagna? That bald guy at table seven. Where’s the bathroom? On the left, just past that bald guy. Does the queue start here? No, it goes back to that bald guy.My fear that all hairless men look the same is reinforced by the fact that people keep saying I look like my dad. No one had ever noted this resemblance before. Now, suddenly, we’re like two shiny-headed, bearded peas in a pod. There is a certain poetic justice here, and I suffer regular flashbacks to the bald jokes I’d tell at my dad’s expense. He assures me he didn’t take them personally.My dad started balding at 16. By the time he was my age, his naked head was competing with the mullets and perms of the 1980s. But he appears genuinely impervious to his baldness. “I can’t remember ever being sensitive about it my whole life,” he told me over Zoom. Maybe boomers just don’t like talking about their feelings, but I believe him.“I wasn’t a cool or attractive teenager in the slightest,” he recalled. “But I managed to build up a good social life because I could make people laugh. I took a decision, fairly early on in life, that I’d only get anywhere if I relied on my wit, charm and personality. Baldness was pretty low down on my list of priorities.”Whether he’s to blame for my hairline is matter of debate. Studies of identical twins have found that heredity factors account for around 80% of men’s predisposition to baldness, though the genetics are poorly understood. An old wives’ tale dictates that hair loss is passed down via the mother, and thus your maternal grandfather’s hairline is the best predictor of your own. There is no conclusive evidence for this, however, and my dad sees “no observable pattern” in our family (his generation included one Friar Tuck, one Jude Law and one full head of hair).Lifestyle factors can play a part, and I often wonder whether my fate was hastened by eating trans fats and not sleeping enough, or by living in Beijing during some of its most grimly polluted years. But my hairline’s retreat was likely predestined. As such, I am at peace with it. Although I didn’t grow bald gracefully, I can still aspire to be bald with grace.Anton’s advice for me and fellow newcomers to his “sexy zone” is as follows: Moisturize your head daily, shave it every few days and wear hats to protect against the sun and heat loss alike. If you have a beard, keep it groomed; if you’re muscly, be aware of intimidating people and disarm them with a smile. And remember, he concluded, the way you carry yourself matters more than what is — or isn’t — sprouting from the top of your head.My dad’s advice is a little blunter: “If I were you, I would concentrate on developing your wit, charm and personality.”",style,0.0
598,622,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/mom-botox-advert-blog-gbr-scli-intl/index.html,‘Back to school’ Botox blog promoting injections for moms banned,"01:58 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","A Botox blog promoting injections to mothers on the school run has been banned by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for exploiting women’s insecurities and perpetuating “harmful” gender stereotypes.The action was taken following a complaint to the ASA, the UK’s regulator of advertising, about a promotional page on www.glowday.com, a British aesthetic treatment comparison site.Publishing its ruling online Wednesday, the ASA described the investigation in detail.It said that one of the two web pages it was investigating featured an image of a woman with a child carrying a rucksack, under the heading “Back to school Botox.”Below it, the text stated: “The start of the new school term has an extra edge of anticipation for us Mums this year. It feels like the beginning of normality … with women bearing the brunt of it all – so it’s great we might finally be turning a little attention back to ourselves.”Visitors to the site were invited to choose from a wide selection of “medically-qualified practitioners,” all of whom it said were “insured, checked and verified.” The site included links to providers offering treatments, adding that Botox was the “most popular poison of choice.”It continued: “Glowday has more bookings for treatments in September, then [sic] ever before! Over a quarter of women say lockdown has aged them and are turning to non-surgical aesthetic treatments to put the spring back in their step and perhaps feel more like themselves on the school run.”A picture of a women wearing a dress and high heels was underneath it, followed by a section titled: “Why are Mums having Botox?” The response, according to the article, was: “All these women really want is to look like the very best version of themselves, and feel confident and self-assured. And that’s exactly what aesthetic treatments can do for us.”Botox, a drug made from a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, works by weakening or paralyzing specific muscles or by blocking certain nerves. Originally a treatment for strabismus, or crossed eyes, in the late 1960s and 1970s, the injections were later harnessed by the cosmetics industry for their skin-smoothing properties and were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat frown lines in 2002.Under the ASA’s guidelines, prescription-only medical treatments – including Botox – must not be advertised to the public. Glowday was found to be in breach of this.The ASA said: “We considered the ad exploited women’s insecurities around aging, and perpetuated the harmful gender stereotype that women should look a certain way. We concluded it was irresponsible and breached the (UK Advertising) Code.”The regulator added that the website “went beyond the provision of factual information and instead promoted Botox to the general public.”Responding to the ban, Glowday told the ASA that the article was originally published in September 2021 and had since been removed.It argued that the article was based on research data which surveyed more than 1,000 women aged 26 to 55, many of whom had been involved in childcare and home schooling during the pandemic and school holidays.Glowday said it reported a rise in treatment following the pandemic and school holidays “because caregivers finally had the opportunity to care for themselves.”In a statement to CNN, Hannah Russell, founder and CEO of Glowday, insisted it was not advertising Botox because users cannot purchase or book treatments directly on the site.Instead, Russell said the company aimed to “provide consumers with unbiased information about a whole range of aesthetic and skin treatments.”Russell said: “The irony of the ASA ruling is that whilst thousands of unregulated, unaccountable non-medic injectors continue to dangerously administer fillers and toxin and promote their services across social media and the internet, without recourse, responsible companies like Glowday and its accountable practitioners that are challenged.”A spokeswoman for Glowday added that the content aimed at mothers “wasn’t an advert or a promotion” but a “written article from our editor about a trend.”Holli Rubin, a psychotherapist, body image specialist and mental health practitioner based in London, told CNN: “Women, especially mothers, do not need any additional pressure placed on them – they feel it from all sides – social, emotional, financial, and aesthetic.“Women fail to put their needs above those they work with and take care of and this advertisement just reinforces that in order to value themselves they must partake in these procedures. It is a shame that this messaging continues to be so pervasive today.”",style,0.0
600,624,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/beauty-skincare-climate/index.html,The $500 billion beauty industry’s ‘green’ ambitions are a patchwork at best. And they’re falling short,"01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","The escalating climate crisis is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal.Strategy and consulting firm Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021 found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.This shift in consumer preferences has propelled many beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away from single-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and “greenwashing,” where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.Companies often use marketing language like “clean beauty” to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”In a 2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change” their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde — it claims to never use in its products.)“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”The industry’s plastic packaging is a particular sustainability challenge — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used 144,430 metric tons of plastic in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States only recycles 4% of its plastic waste.Many brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.However, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”Beauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.“Smaller businesses do more, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”Sephora launched its “Clean + Planet Positive” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with.The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born B Corporation, or B Corp. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among eco-conscious consumers, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency  lists 2,495 substances banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration only lists 11, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied lab tests of 51 sunscreen products in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard.However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”In the absence of bold regulations or global standards on sustainability practices, this “leadership” — undertaken both by brands and customers in the beauty marketplace — is likely to be the most immediately impactful vector for addressing the industry’s climate shortcomings. It will take continued collective advocacy and initiative to see meaningful climate-conscious change.",style,0.0

But I’m not afraid that the tradition will end because (I’m training) the next tattoo masters.”“The tradition will continue as long as people keep coming to get tattoos,” she added.“As long as I can see well, I will keep giving tattoos. I’ll stop once my vision gets blurry.”Vogue Philippines editor-in-chief Bea Valdes said staff at the publication decided unanimously that Whang-Od should go on the cover. “We felt she represented our ideals of what is beautiful about our Filipino culture.“We believe that the concept of beauty needs to evolve, and include diverse and inclusive faces and forms. What we hope to speak about is the beauty of humanity,” Valdes added.Prior to Whang-Od’s appearance in Vogue Philippines, the record for oldest Vogue cover model was held by actress Judi Dench, who appeared on the front of British Vogue in 2020, at the age of 85.",style,0.0
602,626,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tiktok-teenage-look-beauty-filter/index.html,"TikTok’s latest trending beauty filter, Teenage Look, returns users to their younger selves","01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","TikTok users of a certain age are getting a heavy dose of nostalgia with a new trending filter that purports to wind back time to your teenage self.Teenage Look, which mostly works by smoothing out wrinkles, has quickly racked up 3.4 million views to date, often paired with the melody from The Verve Pipe’s 1996 alt heartbreak song “The Freshmen.” But while baby face and aging filters have previously made the rounds on social media platforms for the simple novelty of seeing yourself time travel instantaneously, many of the top-liked posts teenage-filter posts are somber in tone, as users say they are getting a flashback to some of their most formative years.“If you’re young and you’re wondering why us old people are freaking out about this filter, it’s because 20, 30 years from now in your head you’re still gonna think you look like this,” says TikTok user mandertok in one video, with the filter on so that he appears younger. “And then there will be some sort of filter that makes you realize you look like this now,” he continues, showing the split screen with his real, visibly older self.While some TikTokers are keeping it light, showing real pictures of their teenage selves (hello, former scene kids with bad hair) others are using the filter to talk about the lack of self-confidence they had in high school or the difficult experiences they faced, using split screens of the before and after to impart life advice to their “younger” selves.Though many of the posts featuring tears and shocked faces can feel performative for virality’s sake (it is TikTok, after all), there is something jarring about being able to see a face that hasn’t looked back at you in the mirror for some time. Some users have discussed how the filter has kicked up old emotions related to trauma they experienced during those years, while others said it’s given trans and non-binary individuals the opportunity to see a younger self that matches with their gender identity.“Okay y’all, if you’re somebody who has changed the way they present themselves as an adult or have transitioned in some way and you wanna have a moment, say hi to the 12-year-old you that probably didn’t get to exist,” the user worriersmusic said in one video.However, filters have regularly been criticized broadly for worsening self-esteem issues, and an anti-aging filter in an anti-aging society, particularly for women, seems primed to perpetuate this problem. One small study from 2019 linked social media filter use with higher acceptance of cosmetic surgery, while researchers from Harvard Business Review found in 2021 that people with high confidence in their looks can actually be rattled more by seeing “improvements” to their face versus those who already had insecurities. And while the “Teenage Look” filter may not always be accurate at showing an earlier you, as many users have noted, it is more natural-looking than many of the uncanny valley or soft-focus beauty filters in circulation.Upon applying the filter, some users have also commented that the signs of age appear more pronounced in the unfiltered image.“Seriously, they are making the ‘now’ look worse to make it more dramatic, right? Right?!” mandertok half-jokingly wrote in the video’s caption.",style,0.0
604,628,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/madonna-grammys-ageist-response/index.html,Madonna hits back at ageist criticism after Grammy Awards appearance,"01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","Madonna has spoken out against criticism of her appearance after presenting at the Grammy Awards Sunday night. In her latest Instagram post, the multi-award-winning singer lamented being “caught in the glare of ageism and misogyny that permeates the world we live in,” after a close-up photo of her face went viral online and sparked a torrent of negative comments.The image was taken while Madonna was introducing Kim Petras and Sam Smith’s performance of “Unholy.” (Smith identifies as nonbinary, while Petras became the world’s first openly transgender woman to perform at the event.) Madonna called it a “history making moment,” adding: “Instead of focusing on what I said in my speech which was about giving thanks for the fearlessness of artists like Sam and Kim — many people chose to only talk about close-up photos of me taken with a long lens camera by a press photographer that would distort anyone’s face!”Madonna’s Instagram page was flooded with comments calling her scary, unrecognizable and denouncing her supposed “obsession with plastic surgery” — though the singer has never publicly addressed rumors of cosmetic enhancements. The British television host Piers Morgan, who is often criticized for making hateful and sexist comments, dedicated a segment to the viral photo on his Talk TV show, “Piers Morgan Uncensored.”The 64-year-old musician clapped back at the remarks, saying in her Instagram post that the world “refuses to celebrate women past the age of 45.”Being thrown into the spotlight over a controversial look is familiar territory for Madonna. But the singer, who famously wore a satin slip dress in the 1989 music video for “Like a Prayer” and a Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra during her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour, has seemingly never been deterred by public opinion.“I have never apologized for any of the creative choices I have made nor the way that I look or dress and I’m not going to start,” she wrote in the post. “I have been degraded by the media since the beginning of my career but I understand that this is all a test and I am happy to do the trailblazing so that all the women behind me can have an easier time in the years to come.”",style,0.0

Binders are used to minimize the outward appearance of breast tissue.“The Sims” – one of the best-selling PC games since its debut in 2000 – has also introduced medical wearables, including hearing aids and glucose monitors, the makers announced on publisher EA’s website on Tuesday.While these new assets are purely visual, without any gameplay functionalities – the binder, for example, does not change the Sim’s body shape – many have praised the game’s endeavor to become more inclusive.One person tweeted that the update made her cry, adding: “I’m non-binary and this made my heart happy. It’s not perfect and the binder not binding is disappointing but they’re taking steps to make trans and non-binary people feel more representation in game and that’s a huge start.”“Love the new medical wearables,” another person tweeted. “This means a lot to us disabled simmers. More of this please!”The move has also proven controversial.Some Twitters users have called the addition of top-surgery scars irresponsible in a game played by children.Others have suggested that in a game where players can drown their Sims, starve them or embarrass them to death, the latest additions seem like a strange thing to object to.Players can already choose and change their characters’ gender and sexual orientation.“I never get the hate for adding more inclusive options for character customization. They are options. You don’t have to include them for your character, no one is forcing you to,” another commentator tweeted.",style,0.0

What’s another change you’d like to see and why?”Gabriel responded that she hoped the contest organizers would increase the candidate age limit.“For me, I would like to see an age increase because I am 28 years old. And that is the oldest age to compete. And I think it’s a beautiful thing. My favorite quote is ‘if not now, then when?’ Because as a woman, I believe age does not define us. It’s not tomorrow, it’s not yesterday – but it’s now. The time is now,” she said.Houston-native Gabriel is a model, fashion designer, and sewing instructor who prioritizes the environment in her work.Earlier in the pageant, Gabriel donned a red-orange cape inspired by a rising phoenix with the maxim “if not now, then when,” which she had dyed herself. The words take inspiration from her father’s advice to act on goals, dreams and desires.In the final question and answer segment of the competition, the Top 3 contenders were asked how they would work to demonstrate Miss Universe as an empowering and progressive organization if they won the title.Gabriel said she would use the platform to be a “transformational leader” and emphasized her passion as a force for good in the fashion industry by cutting down on pollution and using recycled materials in making clothing pieces.“I teach sewing classes to women that have survived from human trafficking and domestic violence. And I say that because it is so important to invest in others, invest in our community, and use your unique talent to make a difference,” Gabriel said.“We all have something special and when we plant those seeds for other people in our life, we transform them and we use that as a vehicle for change.”This year’s pageant was organized for the first time by JKN Global Group PCL, a Thailand-based media distribution company, after tycoon and transgender rights advocate Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip bought the Miss Universe Organization for $20 million in October.Jakkaphong has been outspoken about her experiences as a transgender woman, and is also the first woman owner of the pageant.She made an appearance onstage to award the ImpactWayv Challenge winner to Thailand’s Anna Sueangam-iam, honoring her commitments for social good.Miss Thailand had in the preliminary rounds of the pageant made waves in a dress made of soda tabs – a tribute to her humble beginnings and her parents’ work as garbage collectors.A previous version of this article misidentified Gabriel.

Calaor, who is Filipina American, asked Stefani if she had learned anything from this period in her career. In response, Stefani spoke about her father’s regular business trips to Japan, explaining that he would come back with stories that were “fascinating” to her, before telling Calaor she thought she was Japanese when she first visited the Harajuku area of Tokyo. She later also referred to herself as a “superfan” of the culture.“If (people are) going to criticize me for being a fan of something beautiful and sharing that, then I just think that doesn’t feel right,” she told Calaor, in defense of her Harajuku era. “I think it was a beautiful time of creativity…a time of the ping-pong match between Harajuku culture and American culture,” Stefani continued. “If we didn’t buy and sell and trade our cultures in, we wouldn’t have so much beauty, you know?”Representatives for Stefani did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment about the article or the subsequent social media response.Calaor outlined her discomfort at Stefani’s comments, particularly against the “sobering” backdrop of increased racism towards Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities in the United States. “I envy anyone who can claim to be part of this vibrant, creative community but avoid the part of the narrative that can be painful or scary,” she wrote.On social media, negative reactions to Stefani’s interview range from bemusement to anger. “Gwen Stefani’s publicist must be busy today,” read a tongue-in-cheek tweet from American author Roxane Gay, while The Cut reporter Olivia Truffaut-Wong accused Stefani of using “Asian women as props to help her get rich.”According to Allure, Stefani’s team reached out the day after the interview, maintaining Calaor had “misunderstood” what Stefani was trying to say, but did not did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview or offer on-the-record clarification of the comments.",style,0.0
609,633,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/moshe-safdie-architect-singapore/index.html,"‘My beliefs haven’t changed’: From social housing to skyscrapers, architect Moshe Safdie is still an idealist","01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city’s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal “skypark” and the world’s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore.In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn’t even stay there.“It’s too noisy,” said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. “I’m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.”Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (“I had a British mother,” he explained, “so I’m a sucker for scones and tea.”) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks.“It wasn’t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,” he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state’s government in the mid-2000s. “They didn’t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.“When we made the submission, I said, ‘Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.’ And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, ‘It’s a mystery what makes that happen.’”The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.“That kind of stuff, you can’t quite plan for or design – it just happens,” he said of the building’s success. “But I’m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.”Safdie’s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect’s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he’s in Singapore. “I was concerned about how the plants were doing,” he said. “But I was relieved to see they’re thriving.”The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island’s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges – a recurring theme in Safdie’s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan “horizontal skyscraper” (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands’ second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower – though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn’t, in his words, “screw around” with an icon.Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming “sort of an exclamation mark,” he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: “Boooom… boom.”Radical visionAt 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect’s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, “If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.” He said he felt it was “time to document things.”Published this week, “If Walls Could Speak” serves as a reminder that much of Safdie’s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits – museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal’s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie’s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale “Habitats” around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran’s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie’s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking.But the principles underpinning the experiment – that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors – defined his work thereafter.Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa’s Mount Carmel and then at his family’s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha’i Gardens “almost functioned as my backyard,” he writes in “If Walls Could Speak.” One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre.Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture – and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city’s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, “A Case for City Living,” outlining his vision for a flexible housing “system” that could be adapted to different contexts and climates.Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie’s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect’s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event’s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents’ views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments – made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three “clusters.” It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie’s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century’s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had “outdone” the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project “was a game changer,” he recounted.Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked “gentle fun” at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.“It’s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,” Safdie mused. “But that’s been true of my career.”‘For everyone a garden’To define Safdie’s career by either his breakout success or the “megascale” projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi’in-Maccabim-Re’ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem.He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto’s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country’s most treasured art.Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his “Habitats” in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao – in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing – a series of 16-story “mini blocks” connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie’s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot.In both cases – and throughout Safdie’s career – ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same.“The belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture – from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,” he said. “And they haven’t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.”“I think, without bragging, there’s been consistency,” he added. “In fact, you could say I’ve not been dynamic enough, but I’ve been pretty consistent.”Idealism and compromiseThere were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan’s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987’s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).But Safdie’s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn’t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream – something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed “for everyone a garden” in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and “living walls” are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between “significant plant life” and “sorry shrubs.” So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures.“The idea of green buildings is a battle cry – everyone is for it,” he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. “There’s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there’s no preparation for the earth, there’s no depth – it’s a fantasy.”Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.“For a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),” Safdie said. “But now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor – not in China, because they’ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.”Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he “never would have imagined” how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. “Programs change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,” the architect added.But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? “My daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,” the architect said. “I disagree with her.”Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving “regimes you’re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,” he noted.“Take the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,” he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton’s lounge. “On the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote ‘gaming’ – that’s a nice word for it, but ‘gambling’ is the reality – is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.“But, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that… could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.“That’s compromise,” he concluded. “But the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don’t know how you can be an architect.”“If Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,” published by Grove Atlantic, is available now.Top image: Moshe Safdie pictured on the highest skybridge of his Sky Habitat project in Singapore.",style,0.0
610,634,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/liu-heung-shing-coca-cola-snap-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,Photo of a man posing with a Coca-Cola bottle in 1981 symbolized a cultural shift in China,"01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","A young man stands grinning in Beijing’s Forbidden City. It’s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle.Today, Coke is the world’s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people.Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.“The changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn’t have noticed,” he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign — a series of failed industrialization policies — before moving back to Hong Kong as a child.Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader’s death, Liu said, “suddenly, people’s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.”It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history — politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a “Democracy Wall” in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government.One of Liu’s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was “missing.” He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame.This was China “moving out of the shadow of Mao,” he said.In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China’s transformative economic reforms with his “Open Door” policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois).Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of “ganbei” (cheers). He then thought to himself, “Now where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?”He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand.“I remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: ‘It tastes so-so’” said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace’s picturesque pavilions in the background.The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time.“As a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People’s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,” he said, adding: “But I didn’t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.”The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu’s photography book “China after Mao,” a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book “Liu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.”The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country’s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu’s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether.With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign — ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks — the image stands in stark contrast to today’s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping’s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.“I realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,” Liu said.“Especially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people’s collective memory.“Even though this memory keeps being re-edited… the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it.

In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time.“Men holding hands or lying in each other’s laps is not an issue — it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they’re usually just hanging out,” he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: “I was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.”Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the “repressive atmosphere” of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today — and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an “unnatural offense” — the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi’s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument’s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. “I passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,” he said. “You just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.”The image forms part of the photographer’s series “Exiles,” which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India’s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera.Concerned about “outing” his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a “constructed documentary” approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show.“There was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,” he said of the India Gate shoot. “And there were other photos that were (more suggestive)… So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.”The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used — and the art of photography itself.“It wasn’t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,” he said, adding: “Then I tried to explain the process.”Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still “a very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.”Now among India’s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York’s Christopher Street that captured the city’s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic.Although “Exiles” presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta’s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced “a lot of hostility” at art school for making work relating to his sexuality.“I couldn’t make gay work, and I couldn’t make gay work about India, especially,” he said. “There was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, ‘I’m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon — we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.’”New York’s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series’ place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success.“It didn’t have any impact when it was first shown,” Gupta said of its debut.  “I think it was too early.”By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta’s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that “Exiles” is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.Although the country’s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (“Those sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening — or maybe happening less,” he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light.“I think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,” Gupta said. “People think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don’t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.”This is a message reflected in the photographer’s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight.“It just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.”“Exiles” is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now.",style,0.0
612,636,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html,How this photographer makes sublime landscapes of the American West,"01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron.“(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,” he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, “Time’s Arrow,” this month), he began a new career from scratch. “While the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.”Wu’s imagery takes a classic photographer’s combination — light and landscape — and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.The artist’s 2018 photo book “Lux Noctis” is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled “An Irresistible Force,” outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby’s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500).“I couldn’t have dreamed of where I am now,” Wu said. “I just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.”Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn’t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg’s “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” which featured Wyoming’s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).The film’s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. “(It’s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,” he said.He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot.“I flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,” he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a “massive” eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he’s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up.“I’m a lot less anxious now, because I’ve crashed a number of drones,” he said. “And in the end, they’re just tools.”After developing series of still images such as “Lux Noctis” and “Aeroglyphs,” which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced.“These (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal — they were just things that I did for love out of love,” he said. “I couldn’t license them, I couldn’t print them… and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.”But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first “non-fungible token”  on the marketplace Foundation two months later — an “aeroglyph” of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled “Aeroglyph Variations,” which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints.“It’s very much a hybrid medium, and so I’d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,” he said. “Am I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?”Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent.“A lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly — that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,” he said. “But I’m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I’m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.”",style,0.0
613,637,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/harold-edgerton-bullet-apple-snap/index.html,‘How to make applesauce’: A photograph that made time stand still,"01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","Exploding with energy but perfectly still, Harold “Doc” Edgerton’s 1964 image of a .30-caliber bullet ripping through an apple showed an otherwise unseeable moment in captivating detail. The scene took on a serene, sculptural beauty as the disintegrating apple’s skin burst open against a deep blue backdrop.The picture is widely viewed as a work of art. More importantly to its creator, however, it was also a feat of electrical engineering. The longtime Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor used it to illustrate a lecture, famously titled “How to make applesauce,” in which he explained the pioneering flash technology that helped him take the shot.Edgerton, who died in 1990 aged 86, is considered the father of high-speed photography. Camera shutter speeds were too slow to capture a bullet flying at 2,800 feet per second, but his stroboscopic flashes — a precursor to modern-day strobe lights — created bursts of light so short that a well-timed photograph, taken in an otherwise dark room, made it appear as if time had stood still. The results were mesmerizing and, often, messy.“We used to joke that that it took a third of a microsecond (one-millionth of a second) to take the picture — and all morning to clean up,” recalled his former student and teaching assistant, J. Kim Vandiver, on a video call from Massachusetts.While early camera operators had experimented with pyrotechnic “flash powders” that combined metallic fuels and oxidizing agents to produce a short, bright chemical reaction, Nebraska-born Edgerton created a flash that was far shorter and easier to control. His breakthrough was more a matter of physics than chemistry: After he arrived at MIT in the 1920s, he developed a flashtube filled with xenon gas that, when subjected to high voltage, would cause electricity to jump between two electrodes for a fraction of a second.By the time he fired the shutter for his now-famous apple photo, Edgerton had developed a microflash that used plain air rather than xenon. He had also produced decades’ worth of well-known images: hummingbirds in mid-flight, golf clubs hitting balls and even nuclear bomb blasts. (During World War II, Edgerton developed a special “rapatronic” — or rapid electronic — camera for the Atomic Energy Commission that could control the amount of light entering the camera during the explosions.)Yet, it was his 1960s bullet photos that proved some of this most memorable. According to Vandiver, who still works at MIT as a mechanical engineering professor, the challenge wasn’t producing a flash but setting the camera off at just the right time. Human reactions were too slow to take the photo manually, so Edgerton used the sound of the bullet itself as a trigger.“There would be a microphone out of the picture, just down below,” Vandiver said. “So, when the shock wave from the bullet hit the microphone, the microphone tripped the flash and then you’d close the (shutter afterwards).”Over the years, Edgerton and his students took a rifle to objects including bananas, balloons and playing cards. For Vandiver, the reason why the apple — along with a 1957 image of a splashing milk droplet — became one of Edgerton’s defining photographs is, in part, its simplicity. “It catches your imagination… and you immediately understand what it is,” he said.There was another factor at play: Edgerton’s artistic eye. The compositional beauty of his images saw them republished in newspapers and magazines around the world, and over 100 of his photos are held by the Smithsonian American Art Museum today. Yet Edgerton rejected the additional title.“Don’t make me out to be an artist,” he has been quoted as saying. “I am an engineer. I am after the facts, only the facts.”While Vandiver said “there’s definitely an artistic legacy” to Edgerton’s visual experiments, which advanced the field of photography, his research has greatly impacted science and industry, too. His hands-on approach lives on at MIT’s Edgerton Center, which was established in his honor in 1992. Vandiver, who serves as the center’s director, said every student is encouraged to take a bullet photograph of their own.“We still teach the course, and students still think of weird things to take pictures of,” he said, recalling recent images of colored chalk and lipstick torn apart by bullets. “Apples are boring now.”",style,0.0
615,639,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/jon-horvath-photography-bliss-idaho/index.html,"The small town of Bliss, Idaho, is ‘disappearing’ — a photographer has created a capsule of life there","01:59 PM, Fri May 12, 2023","Bliss, Idaho, is nestled in the curve of Interstate 84, which snakes around the small, rural town on its way north to the state capital, Boise, some 85 miles away. When Milwaukee-based photographer Jon Horvath first visited Bliss in the late summer of 2013, he was on a meandering road trip following the end of a relationship. At the time, around 300 people resided there, served by a small community church, K-12 public school, diner, post office, gas stations, motels and two bars.“If you find yourself there… it’s likely to be simply to fill up your gas tank, maybe catch a quick meal at the diner, but that’s probably about it,” Horvath explained in a phone call.Buck Hall, a Bliss resident, told Horvath on his first visit that the town had once seen more regular visitors, but that construction of the Interstate decades ago had shifted traffic away, the photographer recalled. Once a place to pass through, Bliss became a place to pass by — a touch of irony on an exit sign.“(Hall) summed up the state of the town,” Horvath recalled of this early conversation. “His words were: ‘We’re a town of 300 people, and 299 when I die.” (Since Horvath’s photographs of Bliss, a new truck stop has brought additional jobs to the town, but the 2020 census reveals that its population is now just above 250. Buck Hall passed away in 2021, at the age of 75.)Horvath’s first images of Bliss just scratched at its surface — he took the expected images of deteriorating or empty spaces that contrasted with the town’s name, he explained — but as he returned over the course of three years, drawn to the people he met there and their stories, a more complex body of work began to take shape.Now a book titled “This is Bliss,” Horvath’s body of work doesn’t follow a traditional documentary-style record of a place. Instead, black-and-white and color film photographs, tintypes, archival images, ephemera and scanned objects from Bliss form a sort of dreamlike time capsule.During his time there, Horvath found a different way of telling a story about the American West. Rather than the sprawling photographic explorations of the region lensed by photographers like Robert Adams or Stephen Shore, “This is Bliss” mostly covers a small area — roughly a mile-wide — that Horvath continually returned to, peeling back the town’s layers.“There is a macro level to the work that was looking at a longer, deeper history of the region,” Horvath said, “and some of the stories that we tell about ourselves as Americans.”Bliss may be a small mark on the map, but it’s been part of much bigger stories: It’s located on the Oregon Trail, a throughway for settlers to expand West during the rush of Manifest Destiny. It’s close to where stunt motorcyclist Evel Knievel famously attempted (and failed) to jump Snake River Canyon in 1974, Horvath pointed out. And it was home later in life to author JD Salinger’s friend Holden Bowler, for whom Salinger’s famed “Catcher in the Rye” protagonist Holden Caulfield was named.“There’s all these myth-making events within our own history that (have) come to have some presence in this town,” Horvath said,But there’s what Horvath calls a “micro line” in the narrative too, from the residents’ lives to his own “quest to rediscover what ‘bliss’ might be.” He added: “A mythology exists there too… my arrival to town coincided with a restart in my own life.”Some of his experiences in Bliss feel like fiction, Horvath said — like the time he was served by a bartender named Cinderella. Hall once instructed him to drive to a cliffside by moonlight and he’d find a rock formation that local legend has enshrined as the craggy profile of a Native American chief; Horvath did so and snapped a picture, which has become a self-printed postcard enclosed with the book.During one visit, he drove to a nearby gravesite with only six plots, marked by crooked white wooden crosses and a faded sign etched with  “Chinese Memorial Cemetery.” A historical pamphlet Horvath purchased in a local gas station claims that the plots hold the bodies of 16 migrant railroad workers who died in an explosion in 1883 and were buried together, though that total is disputed.All of our stories and memories shape a place, as imperfect as they may be. Horvath isn’t a historian, and so as he gathered anecdotes and records of Bliss, he said he accepted them all, fact-checked or not, as part of the town’s archive. “I loved the idea that I’d meet Buck Hall on the side of the road, and he’s (telling) me stories,” he added. “Are they true? Are they not true? Maybe in a different universe that would matter.”Fittingly, at the end of “This is Bliss,” Horvath wrote a piece of short fiction loosely based on his experiences there.“We either embellish or we take liberties, or we bring some of our invention to them,” he said.“This Is Bliss,” published by Yoffy Press and FW:Books, is available now.Top image: Buck Hall reflected in the hood of Horvath’s car.",style,0.0
616,640,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/zephalto-celeste-edge-of-space-dining-scn/index.html,"Michelin-star meals on the edge of space offered for $130,000",2023-05-11 05:53:00,"Eating a Michelin-star-level meal on the “edge of space” could be a reality next year, if French company Zephalto has its way.The space tourism venture, founded by former air traffic controller Vincent Farret d’Astiès, is currently selling “pre-reservation tickets” for upcoming trips in a pressurized capsule, dubbed Celeste, attached to a stratospheric balloon.This capsule will ascend to an altitude of 25 kilometers (about 15.5 miles), allowing guests to marvel at the curvature of the Earth. In between gawping at views, travelers will be wined and dined in style.Pre-reservation tickets are going for 10,000 euros (roughly $10,900) and give purchasers a chance to reserve a seat whenever tickets go on sale. All in all, a trip on Celeste will set you back 120,000 euros (around $131,100).Zephalto told CNN Travel that seats on board the first flights from late 2024 to mid-2025 have already been scooped up, and they’re now selling pre-reservation slots for mid-2025 onwards.Celeste promises to ferry six passengers and two pilots to maximum altitude in just 90 minutes, at a speed of four meters per second. The capsule will then float above Earth for three hours – plenty of time to enjoy a multiple-course meal and several glasses of fine French wine.Farret d’Astiès told CNN Travel that while Celeste’s food and beverage options will be luxurious, “the view and overall journey remains the central focus of the offering, allowing guests to appreciate and take in the beauty of their surroundings.”Since Dennis Tito, the first ever “space tourist” hit the skies in 2001, few have followed in his footsteps. But in recent years, high-profile space tourism companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic have been making moves in this arena, vowing to make space the next must-visit vacation spot.Zephalto, founded in 2016, isn’t the only company hoping to transport passengers in a fancy hot air balloon. Floridian company Space Perspective is currently taking reservations for its Spaceship Neptune.It’s worth remembering there’s a big difference between a trip to orbital space – involving gravity-busting high-speed takeoffs and longer duration – and suborbital space, in which travelers are briefly exposed to weightlessness and views of space during a flight to the edge of the atmosphere, 60 miles above Earth.And trips to the “edge of space” – like those proposed by Zephalto and Space Perspective – are different again.These capsules won’t actually hit suborbital space, but will still fly significantly higher than your average commercial airplane. That means great views of the Earth and the stars, but without the loss of gravity and accompanying feeling of weightlessness.Farret d’Astiès likens the atmosphere inside Celeste as the same as traveling by plane, just with more incredible views and luxurious vibes. The interior of the pressurized capsule is currently being planned by French designer Joseph Dirand. Designs have yet to be released, but Zephalto promises they’ll exude “French savoir-faire.”While Celeste’s prospective chefs have yet to be announced, the idea is there will be a rotating door of culinary masters who’ll have free reign to choose what’s on the menu. Zephalto is keen that “chefs are able to exercise their creative license and ensure the ability to personalize the guest experience to offer something that is refined and elevated” – so some chefs may decide dining should happen before, rather than during, the journey.Zephalto says it has also been working closely with France’s space agency, CNES, on the project and counts aviation company Airbus as one of its partners. The company says the balloon, which be powered by helium, will be required to have the same European Aviation Safety Agency certifications as a commercial aircraft.Zephalto says it has completed three piloted partial test flights, with another scheduled for later this year which is set to undergo the full journey. Flights will open to people of all ages, and no prior training is needed.For now, Celeste is planned to take off from France, but Zephalto hopes to go global before long.",travel,0.0
617,641,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/msg-changing-views-cmd/index.html,MSG is the most misunderstood ingredient of the century. That’s finally changing,2023-05-10 23:15:00,"Calvin Eng, the owner of New York-based Cantonese-American restaurant Bonnie’s, isn’t shy about his love for monosodium glutamate.Case in point – he has the letters “MSG” tattooed on his arm, and his restaurant’s menu includes a signature drink called the MSG Martini.“Things just taste better with MSG, whether it’s Western food or Cantonese food,” the chef tells CNN.“We use it in drinks. We use it in desserts. We use it in savory food. It’s in almost everything. Salt, sugar and MSG – I always joke that they’re the Chinese Trinity of seasonings.”Openly admitting to using MSG – once a surefire way to keep your restaurant empty – certainly hasn’t undermined Bonnie’s success. It’s become one of the hottest tables in New York since opening in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in late 2021, winning numerous Best New Restaurant awards from multiple media outlets.Eng himself was named one of the best new chefs of 2022 by Food and Wine Magazine and was included on the 2023 Forbes 30 under 30 list, just to name a few of his recent achievements.Eng is one of several celebrated chefs, including Momofuku’s David Chang and author/chef Eddie Huang, now embracing MSG and trying to destigmatize the century-old seasoning.“Growing up, it was taboo to use MSG,” says Eng.“My mom would never use it, but she’d use chicken powder in her cooking. As a kid, I didn’t know they were like the same thing until I was old enough to care to know about it.”Here’s a quick recap of MSG’s history:In 1907, Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda boiled down a huge amount of kombu seaweed to extract a substance – glutamate. Why? It gives certain foods, like dashi broth, a long-lasting savory flavor.He coined the taste “umami,” then broke the substance down into MSG, which as a crystallized substance can be used like salt and sugar.A year later, businessman Saburosuke Suzuki acquired a joint share of the MSG patent and, with Ikeda, founded the company Ajinomoto to manufacture the seasoning.It soon became an award-winning invention and a prized condiment, especially among middle-class housewives in Japan.In the decades to come, it became well-known around the world.The US military even held the first-ever MSG symposium after World War II to discuss how the seasoning could be used to make tastier field rations and boost soldiers’ morale.But MSG’s fortunes began to go downhill in 1968, when a US doctor wrote a letter to a medical journal titled “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.”In the document, he described symptoms like “numbness in the back of the neck,” “general weakness” and “palpitations.” He suspected MSG, along with other ingredients like cooking wine and high amounts of sodium, may have caused these symptoms.MSG took the biggest hit, with the effects of that letter rippling on throughout the decades, all over the world.Restaurants publicly swore off MSG. Food and beverage publicists begged not to be asked about it. Diners experiencing discomfort after a meal blamed it on MSG.“Many didn’t know that MSG is plant-derived,” says Tia Rains, a Chicago-based nutrition scientist and Ajinomoto’s vice president of customer engagement and strategic development.“Our process [of making MSG] is by fermentation, which is very similar to how beer is brewed or how yogurt is made.”First, plants with sugar – like sugarcanes or corn – are fermented with microbes to create glutamate, an amino acid found in food that’s also produced in our body and acts as a neurotransmitter.Then, sodium is added and the glutamate is crystalized to become the salt-like MSG we see in supermarkets and kitchens now.“I’m a scientist by training. I think how MSG works is one of the coolest scientific things,” says Rains.“We have different receptors on our tongue for different tastes. Our receptor for umami looks almost like a Venus Flytrap under a microscope,” she adds, mimicking a “C” with her hand.“Glutamate is the amino acid that has the snug fit to that receptor.”So what’s umami? In recent years it’s been called “the fifth taste” – joining the more familiar tastes of sweet, sour, salty and bitter – and is often described as savory.When the glutamate goes into the receptor, it causes an umami flavor sensation on our tongue. If the food has one of the two nucleotides – inosinate and guanylate – the glutamate is able to stick to the receptor for a longer period.“In layman’s terms, if you want to make an umami bomb, combine the glutamate – which is the core in creating umami – with one of these nucleotides (inosinate and guanylate). It’s like getting multiple hits of umami to your brain,” Rains explains.Sounds complicated? You’ve probably been playing with glutamate, inosinate and guanylate in your own cooking without even realizing it.Carrots and onions (high in glutamate), for example, boost the umami-ness in beef (high in inosinate). Bonito fish (inosinate) and seaweed kombu (glutamate) also combine to create a powerful umami flavor.Foods like tomatoes and cheese even have natural glutamate in them.“When people tell me that they ate at a Chinese food restaurant and they had trouble breathing and tightness in their chest, I get worried – and I’d say, ‘you need to follow up on that because MSG is not an allergen. It’s not going to cause an allergic response. Our bodies make glutamate, so it would not be possible to have an allergy to glutamate’,” says Rains.Despite continued claims of negative reactions to MSG from diners, decades of scientific trials have failed to prove the existence of MSG sensitivity. Government organizations around the world have listed MSG as safe to eat. This includes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which lists MSG as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS).“Although many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to consistently trigger reactions,” says the FDA’s website.The Centre for Food Safety in Hong Kong notes that using MSG could reduce sodium intake, which is known for health issues like high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.“When used in combination with a small amount of salt during food preparation, MSG has been reported to reduce the total amount of sodium in a recipe by 20 to 40%,” said a food safety assessment carried out by a Hong Kong government scientific officer.Yet negative opinions continue to permeate discussions on MSG, leaving the marketing team of Ajinomoto busy as it works to change attitudes.“All these years later, we haven’t really made a dent in sodium levels in the food supply, at least in the US,” says Rains.“We’ve got a tool to help product developers get there and we’re not using it because of a silly, outdated, xenophobic and potentially racist negativity around a food ingredient that has been consumed for over 100 years. It was too big of a challenge to walk away from.”In 2020, the team successfully lobbied Merriam-Webster to change the definition of Chinese Restaurant Syndrome in its dictionary and has hosted symposiums to educate the public about MSG and umami.There’s even a visitors’ center at Ajinomoto’s oldest factory, in Kawasaki, where the remaining crystals of the first-ever MSG created by Ikeda more than a century ago are proudly on display. It also showcases the history of MSG and features a diorama that explains how MSG is made.The tour, mostly in Japanese, is open to the public and is free of charge. Visitors, usually school children, bottle their own MSG keychains and shave bonito flakes to learn more about umami.Then they tour the 370,000-square-feet complex on a panda bus – nicknamed after the company’s mascot, Ajipanda – while smiling staff wave them goodbye from the door.Nowadays, chefs like Eng aren’t afraid of talking about MSG and listing it on their menus, which is helping to change outdated mindsets.“I think our clientele is a young crowd who understands MSG and isn’t afraid to consume it,” he says.“We’re proud to embrace the use of it to help destigmatize the reputation or negative connotation that it does have.”Health concerns aside, some diners simply view the use of MSG as a shortcut – an easy flavor enhancer. Eng disagrees with this take, noting their dishes are created the traditional way.“We still make our stocks and broths with bones for hours. We season our food with MSG a little bit – it’s different from heating water and adding MSG and serving it with noodles,” he says.Many of Bonnie’s dishes are classic Cantonese dishes but with playful and laborious twists.For instance, the Charsiu McRib was inspired by two foods – the classic fast-food burger and a traditional Cantonese steamed black bean and ribs dish Eng’s mother – Bonnie – loves making.To make the sandwich, Eng steams the ribs until the bones can be easily removed from the meat. Then he marinates the deboned rib meat with a house-made charsiu sauce – made with hoisin sauce, maltose, fermented red soy curd, MSG and more – overnight.When the meat is ready, it’s pressed and flattened out for a few hours before being glazed and roasted in the oven.Finally, Eng places a big slab of the rib meat, onions, pickles and mustard on a Cantonese “zyu zai” bun – a classic type of soft bun bought from his mom’s favorite Cantonese bakery in Chinatown.It’s been the hottest item on the menu since Bonnie’s opened.“Our mission from the very beginning was to show people what Cantonese food is and what Cantonese food can be – it’s always going to be playful, fun and approachable,” says Eng.But while opinions towards MSG may be slowly changing in the United States, the same can not be said for the rest of the world.“Depending on where you’re at it could be very negative or very positive,” says Rains.The expert hopes that as the reputation of MSG improves in the United States, it may influence places where MSG is still a forbidden topic.“Negativity around MSG originated here in the United States,” says Rains.“It wouldn’t be unreasonable to think that if we could make a dent here in the US, share the facts and have people understand the ingredient, that it may reverberate throughout the world in the future.”",travel,0.0
618,642,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hampyeong-south-korea-bat-statue-tourism-intl-hnk/index.html,This golden statue was ridiculed when a local government erected it. Then gold prices skyrocketed,2023-05-11 01:56:00,"When a colony of reddish-yellow furred Hodgson’s bats, once thought extinct in South Korea, was found in an abandoned gold mine in the country’s Hampyeong county in 1999, some saw a chance.It was exactly what a rural county – located 270 km (170 mi) south of Seoul – with an eroding population needed to boost revenue.The county government decided it would erect a statue of bats – dubbed “golden bats” by savvy marketers – made from, as one could guess, pure gold.Officials spent 2.8 billion won ($2.1 million) in 2005 to erect the seven-foot-tall (2.13-meter) statue, purchasing 162 kg of gold and 281 kg of silver. Then it took three years for renowned South Korean sculptor Byun Kun-ho to sculpt five golden bats flying through a massive silver ring.The sculpture symbolizes “the harmony and immortality of the universe,” Byun wrote in a paper detailing his work.And the expenses didn’t stop there.The statue was installed in a specially-built exhibition hall resembling a cave, the natural habitat for bats. Beside the statue, they laid a golden egg the size of a coffee table, made with leftover gold and silver, to honor Korea’s mythical heroes born from eggs.The local government promised that the statue would bestow the sheen of ecological wonder to the region and bring hordes of tourists to the cash-strapped cattle farming county.But the artwork immediately faced criticism. Its detractors viewed spending millions on a golden statue as a waste, while the county relies on subsidies for around 90% of its revenue. A local newspaper called the move a “flashy but hollow bureaucratic decision” that was “divorced from the local sentiment.”However, local fortunes turned as the price of the precious metal climbed rapidly. Following the economic uncertainty of the pandemic and the Ukraine war, gold prices reached record levels.The estimated value of the statue has increased five-fold to around 14 billion won ($11 million) in recent days, making it one of the most lucrative investments the county has ever made.Though the statue’s remote location has discouraged travelers, around 15,000 mostly Korean tourists have visited in the past few weeks, according to the county.“As the gold price rises, the interest (in the statue) rises too. So more visitors come,” a county representative told CNN.Costing a mere 2000 won ($1.50) to enter, it has become a draw for tourists visiting the county’s renowned butterfly festival.But the value of the golden statue has attracted unwanted attention too. In 2019, three men were apprehended after allegedly attempting to steal it.The thieves reportedly ran away when the alarm sounded. Since then, the county has added extra motion sensors and high-resolution security cameras, on top of the existing bulletproof glass and steel shutters protecting the statue.County officials say they plan to relocate the statue to the more accessible Hampyeong Expo Park from its current location at the Ecological Exhibition Hall.Though the statue’s valuation may be at an all-time high, the county has no plans to sell it.“We didn’t (build the statue) to make a profit,” a representative for the county said.",travel,0.0
619,643,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/canakkale-troy-turkey/index.html,"In Turkey, a modern city sits alongside a mythical site",2023-05-10 11:53:00,"An enormous wooden horse presides over the marina in Çanakkale, a small port city southwest of Istanbul.The clapboard animal is a mock-up of the Trojan Horse of mythological fame. Some may recognize this specific horse from the 2004 movie “Troy.”It was donated to the city by the film’s producers and there’s a reason for its seemingly random location. Çanakkale (pronounced cha-na-call-ay) stands adjacent to the archaeological site that was once the ancient city of Troy, best known as the setting of the Trojan War in Homer’s “Iliad.”“I spent 25 years digging there, and each year I appreciate it more,” C. Brian Rose, professor of archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “The Archaeology of Greek and Roman Troy,” tells CNN. “It’s somehow different from other sites.”There is plenty of evidence that its proximity to Troy – “Truva” in Turkish or sometimes called “Troya” – is important to Çanakkale’s identity. Statues, benches, signs and other elements bearing Trojan influences are scattered all over town. These are interspersed with references to a more modern conflict which was similarly important to the region: the terrible WWI battle of Gallipoli, which occurred on Turkey’s Gallipoli Peninsula a short ferry ride across the Dardanelles Strait on which Çanakkale sits.Çanakkale itself is a lively, charming place. Ferries come and go. Visitors explore the cobblestone streets of the old quarter which are lined with shops and restaurants. Cafes, bars and kebab spots are kept busy by students from the university. On warm summer nights, vendors hawk their wares on the marina boardwalk under the stoical gaze of the great wooden horse.These and many other delights are reason enough to visit the city, but its primary attraction is the Troy site itself, located 20 minutes south, outside the village of Hisarlik.According to myth, the Trojan War was a decade-long conflict between the people of Troy and the Mycenean Greeks that occurred some 3,000 years ago. It was supposedly waged by illustrious figures including Priam, Hector, and Paris on the Trojan side, and Menelaus, Agamemnon, Achilles and Odysseus on the other. It finally concluded when the Greeks – on Odysseus’ advice – constructed a great wooden horse, hid within it, then waited for the Trojans to bring it within the city walls as a trophy. Once inside, the Greeks poured out of the horse and laid waste to Troy.Today when you visit Truva – either via car or a short bus ride from Çanakkale – a second model of the Trojan Horse looms at the entrance. From there you embark on a path that weaves through and over what remains of the ancient stone walls and streets of Troy – much of which is impressively preserved or restored – and looks out across the fields below onto the waters of the Aegean Sea. If the myths are true, it was in this stretch between the city walls and the sea that the siege of Troy took place.But how true can myths be?“We know that there were many wars that occurred at Troy,” Rose explains. “This is an area where there has been continual war linked to its geographic location because everyone wanted to hold the site.”Troy stood in a geopolitically vital position. It controlled the entrance to the Dardanelles Strait, which links the Aegean with the Marmara and Black Seas. It was also located upon one of the two easiest land crossings between continental Europe and Asia. Because of this, there was fierce competition to control it. There was conflict for 2,000 years, spanning the late Bronze Age (during which the Trojan Wars would have occurred), into the Persian Wars, and on through the Crusades in the medieval period.This was no provincial backwater, but an important crossroads in the region, visited by kings and emperors including Xerxes, Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Augustus. According to famed Greek historian Plutarch, Alexander made a pilgrimage to the temple of Athena Ilias here, where he made sacrifices at what was said to be the tomb of Homeric heroes Achilles and Patroclus.According to Rose, by the time the Iliad was first written down in the eighth century BCE, what had in reality been 200 years of war between many combatants that took place over the course of the late Bronze Age was condensed into a war of 10 years’ duration involving two primary foes. So there is a historical foundation for the Trojan War? He nods: “Sure.”We even have evidence that many of the figures who participated in it were real.Only a single piece of writing from Bronze Age Troy has survived through the ages, says Rose. Clay tablets discovered at Hattusa, the nearby capital of the ancient Hittite people, mention “Wilusa” – their word for “Illios,” which was in turn the Greek word for “Troy” – and discuss diplomatic and military relations with the Mycenaean Greeks. There are even references to Atreus (Agamemnon’s father), Paris – who supposedly sparked the Trojan War with the abduction of the world’s most beautiful woman, Helen – and other characters from the Iliad.Rose calls the tablets, “a history book for what happened in western Asia Minor between the Greeks and Hittites.”At Truva, Rose and his team used MRI scanning to reveal key features of the city, including a pair of defensive systems that some have argued were directly referenced by Homer. This is difficult to verify, however.As he explains, what we today call Troy is in fact a multi-period site with 10 distinct layers of occupation, one atop another, spanning some 4,500 years. Over the millennia, it has been a place of many peoples and names.Regardless of vague timelines and dubious veracity when it comes to some of the specifics, a visit to Truva will be the experience of a lifetime for enthusiasts of the Homeric epics. You can look out from its walls over the ground where, according to legend, Achilles did battle with Hector and Odysseus concocted the ruse of the horse. You walk upon stones that were perhaps trodden by some of the greatest names of myth: Agamemnon and Priam, Helen and Cassandra, Paris and Nestor. And it was here that the root of nearly all Western literature to follow was planted.But you don’t have to be a student of the classics to enjoy Troy. The ruins themselves are impressive, the curation well done, and you can feel the presence of history throughout.What’s more, it lacks the crowds one typically encounters at historic sites of great importance. Here you can explore one of the significant flashpoints of history in peace.Nearby Çanakkale is an excellent place to spend two or three days if you’re visiting Troy. Compact enough to explore its downtown on foot, it has good food, cozy cafes, lively bars, pastry shops (for the obligatory baklava) and souvenir shopping, interspersed with reminders of its historic past.One particularly popular restaurant is Sardalye, where the specialty is locally caught fish and chips. Along the waterfront you’ll find numerous cafes, bars, and restaurants – Ziveriye Ocakbaşı is a great place to explore some traditional Turkish dishes accompanied by a terrace view of the Trojan Horse.Beyond that, Çanakkale is an easy place to simply walk and take in the atmosphere.“It’s a wonderful town,” says Rose. “I enjoy it enormously. It’s not overwhelmed with tourists so it has maintained its own unique charm. I view it as a perfect place for the exploration of the wars that have occurred in that spot in antiquity and the modern period.“If you look on the Asian side in Çanakkale, you see the colossal wooden horse as a reminder of the first of the great east-west conflicts that occurred in this region. Directly opposite it on the European side you see the Gallipoli war memorial commemorating the last – thus far – of [them]. So when I think of Çanakkale I think of those two monumental bookends.”",travel,0.0
620,644,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/weird-railways/index.html,Weird and wonderful trains that break the rules,2023-05-08 10:37:00,"Whether we call them railways or railroads, we’re all familiar with the concept – big, heavy vehicles that can’t climb steep hills, running on two steel rails. That’s the pattern, right?Well, railway technology is more versatile than you think. Over the last 200 years it has evolved to conquer cities, mountains, deep mines and some of the world’s most extreme climates. Here’s a selection of unusual railways that break the rules in order to reach the places other trains can’t roll.If ever a railway was perfectly suited to its environment, it’s the legendary Schwebebahn monorail in Germany’s North Rhine-Westphalia region. Built to link several industrial towns along the narrow, twisting valley of the Wupper river, the suspended monorail was completed in 1901 and was instrumental in the growth of the towns, which eventually merged to become the city of Wuppertal in 1929.It might look unusual to visitors, but to the people of Wuppertal it’s the backbone of the city’s transit network, gliding up to 40 feet above congested streets to offer fast, direct journeys along an eight-mile route.The single rails carrying the trains are supported by a series of 486 steel portals weighing almost 20,000 tonnes in total. More than 80,000 people a day are transported by 31 modern articulated cars traveling at up to 37 mph (60 kph). A replica of the vintage Kaiserwagen (Emperor’s Car) used by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1900 also operates on special occasions but is currently being restored; it’s hoped that it will return to service by spring 2024.Current holder of the record for the world’s steepest public railway, Switzerland’s Stoosbahn opened in December 2017 and has become a global tourist attraction in its own right.The unique cars with their rotating “barrels” allow passengers to stay level and travel serenely up the mountain at gradients of up to 110%. On a route of just over one mile (1.74 kilometers), the railway climbs almost 2,450 feet (744 meters) from the valley station in just five minutes.Stoosbahn is far more than just a joyride though – it’s a vital lifeline for the car-free village of Stoos, which sits high on a mountain near the town of Schwyz, south of Zürich. Each car is fitted with three passenger “barrels” plus a further section for freight. Every year, up to 10,000 tonnes of freight is carried – essential supplies going up the hill to restaurants and hotels, garbage and recycling traveling back down. Up to 1,500 passengers an hour, plus their skis or snowboards, can also be carried – a 50% increase over the previous funicular railway.Riding the Stoosbahn is a unique experience, even if you’re a connoisseur of mountain railways. The smooth transition from level to almost vertical happens very quickly and the view from the rotating cabins is exceptional. You’d have to be very jaded not to be impressed with such an astonishing piece of railway engineering.Pier railways were an attraction at several British seaside resorts in the 19th century, the most famous being the mile-long trip to the tip of Southend Pier on the country’s east coast – which you can still experience today. Most were built for pleasure, usually to save visitors a long walk back to shore.Hythe Pier Railway, on the south coast of England, has always been a little different though; it provides a unique link between dry land and the Hythe Ferry, which has shuttled to and fro across Southampton Water since the Middle Ages.The current pier opened in 1881 and a quirky 2,100-foot railway was added in 1909. It is the oldest continuously operating pier railway in the world. Wagons were initially propelled by hand but in 1922 a new narrow gauge electric railway replaced the original track. Two Army surplus electric locomotives, originally built to work in a World War I mustard gas factory, have worked the trains ever since.The bizarre-looking locomotives continue to pull (or push) their weatherbeaten little coaches along the pier to meet every ferry to and from Southampton Town Quay, despite numerous threats of closure. Visit it while you still can.Monorails have been around for more than a century and examples can be found all over the world, but they’ve never quite fulfilled the futuristic promises of their early promoters. That said, there are a few places where the unique qualities offered by monorails are ideally suited to their environment.Chongqing in China is home to the world’s longest and one of its busiest monorail system, carrying millions of passengers a year on two high-capacity “straddle beam” lines totaling 61 miles in length. At just over 34 miles, Line 3 is also the world’s longest single monorail line with an annual ridership of around 250 million. Opened between 2005 and 2016, the two lines have 70 stations with a mix of underground and elevated sections. Famously, one section of Line 2 passes through the heart of a high-rise apartment block.The city’s unique topography, with extreme differences in altitude between its densely populated mountain plateaus and the Yangtze and Jialing river valleys forced Chongqing’s transit authorities to seek an alternative to conventional metro trains. Monorail’s ability to negotiate steep climbs and tight curves made it the ideal solution when this megacity needed to transform its public transit system.Is it a train? Or is it a bus? Neither, it’s a Ferrobus – a unique form of improvised transport found across mountainous regions of South America.Combining old road bus bodies with rail wheels, these wobbly-looking contraptions are a lifeline for remote mountain villages lacking official road access. Using otherwise abandoned rail lines – often built in the 19th and early 20th century to exploit mineral deposits – Ferrobus routes can be found in Chile, Bolivia and Colombia, climbing high into the Andes.Ferrobus trips are increasingly popular with tourists seeking an unforgettable experience, and likely wanting to avoid uncomfortable and often dangerous road journeys. Chile’s Gondola Carril from Los Andes to Rio Blanco, north of Santiago, operates purely for tourists, but others provide regular, if somewhat unpredictable, transport for locals and tourists alike.Bolivia is arguably the epicenter of the Ferrobus world, with at least three routes, although there’s a constant risk of derailments, not to mention disruption from floods, rockfalls and extreme weather.Riding a Ferrobus requires patience and stamina, but you’re guaranteed to return with some hair-raising stories to tell your friends.Gotta catch ‘em all? Here’s one that will appeal to fans of Pokémon and trains. An otherwise ordinary Japanese local train has been dressed up to resemble the all-conquering franchise’s most famous character – Pikachu.The bright yellow signature color dominates inside and out, with Pikachu motifs covering everything from floor to walls and curtains. One car has seating, while the second car has been fitted out as a fabulous mobile playroom for junior Pokémon trainers. During the two-hour trip from Ichinoseki to Kesennuma in the Tõhoku Region, children can play, nap and socialize with giant plush Pikachus or even pretend to drive the train.Introduced in 2017 to put a smile on local faces after the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2011, which also prompted the reactor meltdown in the neighboring Fukushima region, Pokémon with You is one of several “Joyful Trains” operated by railway company JR East. Ranging from traditional steam trains to luxurious, exotically decorated expresses between cities and resorts, they’re part of an incredibly rich and vibrant railway culture that attracts visitors from all over the world to Japan.Which city is home to mainland Europe’s oldest underground railway? Paris? Berlin? Vienna? In fact, it’s the Hungarian capital Budapest, where line M1 has been operating since May 1896.In the late-19th and early 20th centuries Hungary – then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire - was a vigorous pioneer of new railway technology. This short (2.3-mile) line under Andrássy Avenue on the Pest side of the Danube river was only the third underground electric railway in the world, opening shortly after similar lines in London and Liverpool, England.Like London’s tiny “tube trains” of the same era, the first tunnels in Budapest were built to an unusually small profile and the effects of that decision can still be encountered today on what the locals call “a kisföldalatti,” or “the small underground.” The original trains, more akin to freight cars fitted with wooden shelters, were replaced in 1973 when line M1 was rebuilt and extended, but a ride on M1 is still a very different experience from the city’s later metro lines with their wide-bodied trains and airy stations.Thousand of people a day squeeze into the little yellow trains – a much higher ridership than when it was completed. But with its low platforms and short, angular trains, it’s very different to the usual city metro experience.Over the last two decades, China’s rail industry has become the largest and most varied in the world, helped by the astonishing expansion of the country’s high-speed network and global exports.But there’s far more to China than sleek high-speed trains and megacity subways; the size and diversity of this enormous nation demands ingenious solutions to serve areas conventional trains can’t reach.A unique example is the world’s first hanging monorail with a glass floor, now running in Sichuan Province. The Dayi Air Rail Project connects four stations at busy tourist spots over a seven-mile (11.5 kilometer) route in the city of Chengdu.Unusually, the lightweight car bodies are constructed from carbon fiber and composite foam material. They are powered by rechargeable batteries with electricity from renewable sources. But the panoramic windows and transparent floor are their most spectacular features, allowing up to 120 passengers per trip a 270-degree view combining clean, efficient and quiet transport with a memorable sightseeing trip.Imagine a vehicle that can pick you up outside your home, drive to the nearest railway line, convert itself into a train and then switch back to drop you in the center of a nearby town. It may sound like a story from “Thomas the Tank Engine,” but that exactly what Japan’s DMV Road-Rail buses have been doing since they launched on Christmas Day 2021.The buses, carrying around 20 passengers per trip, run a 30-mile route between the town of Kaiyo in Tokushima and the city of Muroto, Kochi Prefecture. Six miles of the route are along a rural railway line, with the rest in bus mode.With a capacity of 23, including passengers and crew, the DMV is a diesel-powered bus fitted with a set of retractable rail wheels which can be deployed in about 15 seconds. Lighter than a traditional train, the DMV also consumes less fuel and is cheaper to maintain.Billed as “the world’s first operational dual-mode vehicle,” it is actually the latest in a long series of similar experiments to improve rural rail services and reduce their costs. As far back as the 1930s, road buses were converted into railcars in Ireland and similar vehicles to the DMV were tested in England in the 1930s and West Germany in the 1950s.Tokushima prefectural government hopes the DMV buses will become a tourist draw in their own right. It also believes that the vehicles could also be useful for reaching isolated communities in the event of natural disasters such as earthquakes, which can leave sections of roads or railway lines unusable.Not far from the wonderful city of Sydney is a railway experience unlike anything else in the world. Situated in the heart of the Blue Mountains, the Katoomba Scenic Railway is another contender for the title of the world’s steepest railway. But, unlike Switzerland’s Stoosbahn, this railway delivers a hair-raising descent down sandstone cliffs and through epic rock formations and tunnels perched over a stunning rainforest landscape.Glass-roofed cars take up to 84 visitors per trip down the 52-degree (128%) incline, although if you’re feeling brave you can adjust the angle of your seat to the “Cliffhanger” position at 64 degrees. Fortunately, there’s also a “Laidback” option for the less adventurous.The rope-hauled railway dates back to the late-1800s when it was part of the Katoomba mining tramways, but since 1945 the remaining line has been a thrilling tourist attraction. More than 25 million people have braved the trip since it opened and the latest generation of cars feature panoramic roofs, allowing visitors to get an even better view of the forest canopy and rock formations.",travel,0.0
621,645,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/couple-bought-and-renovated-rundown-italian-castle/index.html,They bought a huge rundown Italian castle and transformed it into a luxury retreat,2023-05-09 06:43:00,"When South African couple Max and Joy Ulfane began searching for their dream Italian home around 28 years ago, they never imagined that they’d end up buying a rundown castle in Tuscany.But the entrepreneurs, who are based in the UK, quickly fell in love with Castello di Fighine, a neglected medieval military fortress with an attached hamlet, when they came across it back in 1995.The Ulfanes have since transformed the castle, perched 650 meters (2,130 feet) above sea level in the municipality of San Casciano dei Bagni, near the Umbria border, into a very lavish second home.“We’ve put lots of labor and love in here, facing and overcoming challenges. And lots, lots of money to bring this place back to life again,” Joy Ulfane tells CNN. “And to think that we never wanted a castle, never wanted to own one.”The couple say they’d viewed dozens of unsuitable properties around Italy before the hilltop castle, surrounded by olive groves and forests, was brought to their attention.“One day the sales person told us ‘oh, there’s this place in Tuscany but it’s not for you, you won’t like it’ – and that did it,” adds Joy.Feeling intrigued, they traveled to the hamlet of Fighine to view the castle, and were greeted by a hugely neglected ivy-covered building with high-vaulted ceilings and several rooms, including a wine cellar.Although it was dilapidated and filled with rubble, the Ulfanes saw huge potential in Castello di Fighine and felt it was the right place for them.The Ulfanes were also captivated by the timeless feel of Fighine, which is still encircled by 1.5 meter thick defensive walls with octagonal towers and small round turrets attached.“We visited Fighine and it was just very romantic even if the castle was falling to pieces, covered in ivy and moss,” explains Joy Ulfane. “It was impossible to walk through.”They purchased the fortress, which apparently belonged to an aristocratic family at the time, for an disclosed sum that same year, and soon got to work on what would turn out to be a four-year renovation process.Once they began tearing down the vegetation covering the castle, a tower was discovered that hadn’t been visible previously.The Ulfanes later decided to purchase some of the rundown houses in the surrounding hamlet, and began renovating them once they’d completed most of the work on Castello di Fighine. This process took a further eight to 10 years.They’re very proud of the entire project and consider it to be a real feat, particularly as they to constantly had to liaise with local town hall San Casciano dei Bagno and Soprintendenza delle Belle Arti, the Italian government office responsible for heritage properties, throughout the process.“The castle is classified as a historical property so without the necessary permits from the Belle Arti we couldn’t even overturn a single stone,” adds Joy Ulfane.According to Italian law, any structural changes that could alter the original architecture and purpose of a historic property must be supervised and green lit by the appropriate office, placing many restrictions on the type of work that can be done during this type of overhaul.But the couple focused on restyling the rooms and making the property habitable again.While the renovation process was far from simple, the Ulfanes’ perseverance paid off, and they are very happy with their beautifully restored fortress. The rooms inside the castle have been completely overhauled, with stunning results.Even the old barn has been redone into a reception hall, while the castle gardens feature beautiful box hedges, cypresses, lemons trees, grape vines and roses.The Ulfanes visit their private retreat as often as they can and feel very at home in Fighine.“We come here once a month from London to relax, we love the peace, tranquility and utter privacy of our castle,” says Joy Ulfane.“The gardens, the olive trees and the incredible view from this hill set at 650 meters of altitude, I just wanted that.”The Ulfanes, who keep the castle strictly to themselves, restyled the adjoining houses into five stunning villas with pools and two apartments, which they rent to vacationers.They went on to purchase the hamlet’s old village school, and have since transformed it into a high-end restaurant, Ristorante Castello di Fighine.World-famous German chef Heinz Beck serves as manager at the one-Michelin star restaurant eatery, which has a terrace shaded by wisteria.Although much of Fighine now belongs to the Ulfanes, there are still a handful of locals who have held onto their homes, refusing to abandon the ancient hamlet.Situated close to the likes of Siena, Orvieto, Montepulciano and Pienza, Fighine provides stunning views over southern Tuscany.Visitors can stroll along the hamlet’s narrow alleys, take a walk around the tiny piazza and admire the ancient stone walls covered in flowers.Fighine also has a private theater and a restyled small 16th century chapel, where weddings and other special events are held.Built in the 11th century as a military lookout, Castello di Fighine is connected to the main road by one single unpaved public path.Over centuries, noble families such as the Visconti, Medici, Orsini, and even the pope, fought to control the castle and its territory.According to Paolo Morelli, a former mayor of San Casciano dei Bagni, Fighine began to decline in the 1700s when its strategic defensive role waned.As living conditions in the town grew tougher, local families fled the hamlet in search of a brighter future elsewhere.Historical documents unearthed by Morelli from 1746 indicate that the hamlet was inhabited by just 17 families at that stage, amounting to a population of just 60.The castle survived, but was neglected for many years.“In 1606 it passed into the hands of a nobleman from Rome who was named marquis of Fighine and whose descendants lived in the fortress for nearly four centuries, until it was sold to the Ulfanes,” says Morelli.By the time of Italy’s post-World War II economic boom, the population of Fighine had apparently shrunk down to around a dozen people.“There was no electricity, running water nor toilets, just a nearby freezing cold fresh water source that fed Fighine’s historical stone wash house where village women gathered and can be visited,” says Gloria Lucchesi, an artist and history amateur from San Casciano who has interviewed various locals about life in the bygone days.One interviewee, an elderly lady named Angelica who recently passed away, had lived in Fighine since the 1950s and said that she’d never once considered leaving.“Fighine has always held a special place in the hearts of everyone in the valley, school kids are taken here on tours and tourists can’t miss it,” explains Lucchesi.“Its past grandeur still resonates, it’s the biggest castle in the area and the most beautiful.“The renovation has made it shine again. In Fighine, one can experience life in a medieval village, as in a journey across time.”",travel,0.0

Their fame, like Jaejae’s, has grown wildly in recent years, partly a result of Korea’s ongoing love affair with new technology and how it can develop connections with fans, both at home and overseas.Koreans’ use of the internet, and social media in particular, has helped fuel Seoul’s development into a global cultural powerhouse, believes Jaejae.“The people like fascinating things, I think,” she says. “They take a picture or a video… everything they take and upload through the Internet, that content spreads around the world. So that’s why K-Pop or K-Drama is spreading to the world.”Jaejae describes herself as part of the M-Z Generation, bridging the gap between Millennials and the younger Generation Z. She is also keen to stress that the world she represents is part of a new way of seeing things, something she dubs “Newtro.” This concept, she says, blends a love for the latest things social media and the Internet have to offer with a fascination with all things 1980s and 1990s.“Retro plus new: newtro,” she explains succinctly. “The word is spreading in Korea.”It’s on show, she explains, in the brash and hugely popular gaming parlors, where new and old games mingle and locals spend hours playing new titles in a resolutely old school setting. It’s evident, too, outside Seoul’s beautiful Gyeongbokgung Palace, where young people dress in traditional hanbok dresses, all the better to feel closer to the history of their hometown.Newtro isn’t just for the young, however. It’s also for the young at heart, those keen to espouse the best traditions Seoul has to offer by using the latest methods to spread the word.Hyunju Cho is a retired graphic designer who, on her YouTube channel, also goes by the name of Pearlysien. It’s a space, she explains, where she can show that the older generation can also be steeped in the world of K Media and culture, ranging from food to fashion. She uses her channel to talk about outfits she’s bought in Europe and give tips on the best places to find the hottest dishes in Seoul.“Why do YouTube?” she says, walking around a food market in search of mini sushi that she dubs “drug kimbap.” “Because I am retired. [For] Koreans of my same generation, retiring is the end of life. To do something is difficult.  But I wanted a new life, a new start.”As well as imparting food tips and life advice, Pearlysien is also keen to use YouTube to give life lessons to younger viewers. As a youthful, mischievous 60-year-old, she has one key message. The secret to staying K-Cool is to always try new things, whether it’s a fiery piece of sushi or an all-new outfit. A lesson that’s well worth taking home.Even Seoul’s traditional Korean bathhouses and saunas combine the city’s love of new and old. Found all over the city, these places offer locals a chance to refresh themselves and feel part of the wider community.Known as jjimjilbang, these are not luxury spas, but rather locations where guests strip right down and scrub themselves clean after a long day at the office. The heat is deeply ingrained in the walls and atmosphere, inescapable to all those who come here.The rules are multiple. Clothes are not allowed. Everyone must clean themselves before entering the baths. Long hair should be tied up when in the bath. Toiletries, other than basic soap, are not usually provided.Exfoliation is big news at jjimjilbang, with dedicated scrubbers and towels often available to buy. Sometimes, these baths even offer treatments that are aimed at getting visitors clean as a whistle.This Korean pastime is primal. It is all about water and fire, the chance to cleanse and exfoliate the excesses of the day and, in some cases, eat spicy, hot food afterward. When inside the baths, there is a sense of complete and utter escape.If the jjimjilbang baths offer an escape from reality, there is a big dose of it to be found not far beyond the skyscrapers and apartment blocks that ring Seoul.The demilitarized zone (DMZ), which marks the border between North and South Korea, is just a few miles from the heart of the city and stands as a stark reminder of the geopolitical situation in the region. The Korean peninsula has been split in two since the middle of the 20th century and continues to be at the epicenter of wider struggles between the world’s superpowers. The DMZ stretches for 160 miles and takes in a no man’s land that’s just two and a half miles wide.Famously, it is home to the Joint Security Area (JSA), also known as the Truce Village. It is here where US and South Korean forces maintain a major base and where former US President Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 2019. The South and the North are still technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War, so the area is heavily protected.“For me, working up here feels very surreal,” says Lieutenant John Paul Mulligan of the United States Navy. When asked about concerns over visitors to the JSA running across the border, Mulligan says that training is key.“I would say that the soldiers here are very well trained in their PPR’s (pre-planned responses) and their responses, but also they are very good at de-escalation and preventing international incidents.”That such a border exists so close to Seoul feels, as Mulligan says, surreal. When downtown, amongst the tech-savvy kids and futuristic landscapes, this reality can feel so distant as to be non-existent. Yet the worries that arise from it continue to dominate Korean life, with missile tests and the threat of war never feeling that far away.All men aged between 18 and 28 must complete compulsory military service and there are few exceptions. All seven members of BTS are due to do so, with band member Jin enlisting in December 2022. Soccer star Son Heung Min completed a stint in 2020 (although he and his South Korean teammates were spared the full 21-month requirement after they won the 2018 Asian Games).This patriotism, combined with pride in all things K-Pop, K-Drama and Newtro all go towards making Seoul a city like no other. Somewhere that cleverly balances the bleeding edge of the new, while maintaining a respect for tradition that permeates all parts of society.",travel,0.0

The second sees Christie’s mustache-twiddling Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, investigate a murder on a Devon island.Burgh Island’s official Twitter account describes the hotel as “home to the romantic ghosts of times past” with “infinite sea views, complete privacy with unbeatable #blacktieglam.”The 25-bedroom hotel, set within 21 acres, has been fully restored to be “one of the finest examples of working Art Deco architecture in Europe,” according to the agent.For those not arriving by helicopter, the island is accessible by foot or car at low tide, or by a sea tractor at high tide.The rooms and suites are named after former guests, among them “Agatha’s beach house.” Nestled against the island’s rock face, the beach house was originally built in the 1930s as a retreat for the writer. Nowadays, it has its own outdoor hot tub.The hotel features a mermaid pool – a naturally enclosed body of sea water – a billiard room, sauna and treatment room and numerous bars and restaurants, as well as staff accommodation.It also has planning approval for works to add 12 more guest bedrooms and 13 staff bedrooms.Also on the island – and included in the sale – is The Pilchard Inn, a 14th-century tavern that originally served the fishermen who lived on the island and nearby mainland.Over the years, Burgh has been a popular escape for the rich and famous.Back in the 1890s, music hall star George H. Chirgwin built a wooden house on the island, where he would throw weekend parties for his guests.In 1927, it was sold to film producer Archibald Nettlefold, who went on to build a more substantial hotel in the Art Deco style fashionable at the time.The hotel was one of the most popular in the area during the 1930s, though during World War II it was transformed into a recovery center for wounded Royal Air Force personnel.According to the hotel’s website, Christie made it her second home. Playwright and songwriter Noël Coward was among the host of other famous guests, originally checking in for three days, but staying for three weeks.US President Dwight D. Eisenhower is rumored to have met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the hotel before D-Day. Other well-known guests have included the Beatles and former British King Edward VIII and his American wife, Wallis Simpson.Matthew Smith, partner in the Hotel Agency team at Knight Frank, said in a press release that “it is rare for a hotel of such character and heritage to come to the open market.”He added: “Burgh Island Hotel is a stunning example of Art Deco architecture, it’s steeped in amazing history and provides guests with a sophisticated and unique experience.”In a statement emailed to CNN, Burgh Island’s owner, Giles Fuchs, who oversaw an extensive renovation of the hotel, said:“Having watched the hotel be reborn, survive the pandemic, and continue as a wild and beautiful oasis for visitors from across the world, I believe now is the time for me to step aside and allow a new chapter to emerge for Burgh. The sale includes the 14th-century Pilchard Inn as well as the hotel, which remains an important part of Devon’s history and I am excited to see what the future holds for this much-loved property.”",travel,0.0

Here’s why,2023-05-10 06:38:00,"Air travel has bounced back after its pandemic-induced slump, but that doesn’t mean passengers are feeling good about it.North American travelers are frustrated with high ticket prices, staffing shortages and reduced routes, according to consumer research company J.D. Power’s 2023 North American Airline Satisfaction Study.The survey finds overall North American airline passenger satisfaction at 791 out of 1,000, down seven points from the 2022 study – which wasn’t exactly a glowing result either.Michael Taylor, travel intelligence lead at J.D. Power, told CNN Travel that “continued high prices for travel” is the “biggest factor” in passengers’ dissatisfaction.“This score continues to decline,” he said.J.D. Power’s survey breaks down passenger satisfaction by cabin, with Southwest Airlines coming out on top for economy passengers for a second year in a row, with 827 points. Delta Air Lines came in second for economy travelers with 801 points, while JetBlue Airways is a close third with 800 points.Delta Air Lines is number one for premium economy passengers with 848 points, JetBlue Airways is number two for premium economy with 840, while Alaska Airlines rounds out the premium economy top three with 823 points.For those traveling first class or business, JetBlue topped the charts with a score of 893. Delta Air Lines ranks second for first class and business class travelers with 865 points, while United Airlines comes in third with 848 points.J.D. Power found that first class and business class passenger feedback was the most positive overall – and notably, upper tier travelers notably rated their flying experience more highly than last year. Taylor attributes this to reinstated business class and first class food and drink services following a pandemic-enforced hiatus.“In-flight services (food, beverage, entertainment) is the biggest factor for these upper-class cabins. It means more than the price they’re paying for the ticket,” said Taylor. “The ability to ‘get what is expected’ is sort of a rising tide that lifts all factors for these passengers.”While compiling the survey, J.D. Power quizzed 7,774 travelers who’d flown with a major North America airline between March 2022 and March 2023.  As well as considering ticket cost and in-flight services, passengers were asked to rate airlines on aircraft, baggage, boarding, check-in, flight crew and reservation experience.According to Taylor, the most surprising result was the overall high score for flight crew.“Being friendly and helpful when planes are jam-packed is difficult,” he said. “Usually, we see a decrease in scores when travel spaces are crowded and busy. Kudos to the airlines’ staff and crew for managing in a difficult time.”Taylor also has a message for unsatisfied passengers, advising them that aviation is still in an “unusual situation” due to “high demand and lack of crews to man flights” and the landscape will likely shift again.He also points towards a North American pilot shortage and its knock-on effects.“Planes will be fuller and there will be fewer options in air travel until more pilots can be trained and qualified,” he said.1.

Security personnel searched the bathroom and found and seized the hidden camera. According to the criminal complaint, security personnel found a Micro SD card with several hours’ worth of video files inside.The FBI has posted a form online seeking potential victim information. “If you and/or your minor dependent(s) were victimized by Jeremy Froias or have information relevant to this investigation, please fill out  this short form,” the posting says, noting that the timeframe it is focusing on is between April 30 and May 1, 2023.The initial videos on the camera allegedly depict Froias hiding the camera and adjusting the angle to focus on the toilet, then connecting the camera to his the phone using Wi-Fi, before leaving the bathroom.Additional videos reviewed by investigators showed more than 150 individuals, including what appeared to be at least 40 minors, coming into the bathroom to either use the toilet or change into or out of swimsuits, the complaint said.According to the criminal complaint, Froias allegedly “admitted to placing the hidden camera in the bathroom” and told the ship’s security personnel that he knew the camera had been found and taken because he couldn’t find it when he went to check on it on May 1.At his bond hearing Monday, Froias was released to his wife as a third-party custodian and ordered to post a $25,000 unsecured bond with the conditions that he is not to have unsupervised contact with any minors, including his children, is not to have internet access, and is to surrender his passport, among other things, court records show.“Mr. Froias has not been formally indicted. Therefore, I have no comments at this time,” his attorney, Leo Aldridge, told CNN.Royal Caribbean said in a statement that it was aware of the incident on the ship’s April 29 cruise.“The matter was immediately reported to local and federal law enforcement and the guest involved was removed from the ship by authorities for further investigation. As this is an active case, we are unable to share any more details at this time,” the cruise line said.",travel,0.0

People forget about the things that you’ve done in the past.”A late explosion in the second quarter, including a long three-pointer at the buzzer from Curry, gave the Warriors a big lead at halftime and they never relinquished that advantage.Los Angeles’ Austin Reaves did hit a three-pointer with under six minutes to play to cut the lead to single digits as nerves crept in at Chase Center, but Curry settled any anxiety with a scoring spurt of his own to put the game away.“The fact that we can control a game from the jump the way we did, handle that run the way we did and then close out the fourth quarter strong was exactly how we expect to play,” Curry said afterwards.“And it’s just a matter of can we take it on the road and win a must-win game on Friday.”LeBron James led the way for the Lakers with 25 points while Anthony Davis added 23.The scariest moment of the game came in the fourth quarter when Davis took an inadvertent elbow from Warriors center Kevon Looney and appeared to be in a great deal of pain.After leaving the game, Davis didn’t return to the court, with reports suggesting he needed a wheelchair to go to the locker-room.Lakers coach Darwin Ham remained positive about Davis appearing in Friday’s Game 6 in Los Angeles.“He took a shot to the head. He seems to be doing really good already. That’s where he’s at and the status of it right now,” Ham said.The two teams will go now toe-to-toe in Game 6 at Crypto.com Arena as the hotly-contested series rumbles on and James is confident of an improved performance all-round from his team.“Obviously they played exceptionally well here tonight, and we had some good moments, but not as close to 48 minutes as we needed to be, but we’ve got another opportunity on Friday, and we look forward to the matchup again,” James said.“We didn’t handle our business tonight, so I look forward to seeing our fans for another game in the second round.”",sport,0.0

We will know more Thursday morning, but what’s sure is that stage six will be a difficult one for him.”Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Kaden Groves eventually won the incident packed stage, despite himself crashing with seven kilometers remaining.“It’s a dream to win, this is a race I’ve been focusing on since November or December … After two third places this week, they (the team) delivered me to a win,” Groves said.Andreas Leknessund currently leads the overall standings with Evenepoel still sitting second despite a day to forget.",sport,0.0

But we can’t dwell on it, we have to move on to the next game,” Tomori told BT Sport.The second leg of the semifinal between the Milan clubs takes place on May 16 with a place in the Champions League final against either Real Madrid or Manchester City awaiting the victor on June 10.",sport,0.0

It’s not me saying that. Technology says so,” Ancelotti told reporters. “It was shown by beIN Sports. But not VAR [video assistant review] because they didn’t see it. It seems strange to me that they didn’t check it properly. Small details.”Ancelotti was referring to an image shared by beIN Sports which appeared to show that the ball had gone out of play.However, speaking on CBS, rules analyst Christina Unkel explained how Camavinga’s loss of possession meant a VAR check could not place.“We talk about it and explain it as the attacking phase of play,” said Unkel. “There is no set amount of time before a goal we go back to check, instead it’s really predicated by the possession and who has possession of the ball.She added: “When Camavinga took the ball away from De Bruyne, converted it, had plenty of time, made a bad pass … That actually started that window for the VAR to look. Even if this was out, it would not have been reviewed by the VAR leading to the goal.”De Bruyne’s goal canceled out Vinícius Jr’s stunning opener for Real Madrid – a right-footed rocket from outside the Man City box.The result means the tie is evenly poised ahead of the return leg at the Etihad Stadium on May 17.“We got the goal, and from then on, we played really well, controlling the game and creating opportunities,” said Ancelotti.“We’re very pleased with how we went about the game and I hope to see a repeat performance in the return leg.”Meanwhile, it was a quiet night for Man City striker Erling Haaland as he had only three shots during his first appearance at the Bernabéu.It was a different story for the Norwegian’s father, Alfie Haaland, who was moved to a different suite after taunting Real Madrid fans in the stands.Writing on Twitter, Haaland, a former Man City player, said Madrid fans were “not happy” with him for celebrating De Bruyne’s goal. He also denied reports that he had thrown peanuts at the madridistas in attendance.“We had some good banter with Madrid fans,” he said. “They were not happy when City scored. Typical. Then we had to move 50 meters away. Nothing more. All happy.”Madrid next faces Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, while Man City plays Everton on Sunday.

On Tuesday, she attempted to qualify for the major.At nine years old, the Brazilian is the youngest player ever to attempt qualification to the tournament, set to tee off at California’s acclaimed Pebble Beach course for the first time in its 78-year history in July.Simões hit the very first shot of her qualifying group at The Club at Mediterra in Naples, Florida. An impeccable swing technique – posted to the USGA’s Twitter account – drew plenty of plaudits.Yet that should come as no surprise given Simões’ already-impressive résumé. A US Kids Golf World champion for the under-seven’s category in 2020, she defended her title a year later before clinching another victory in the eight-year-olds competition in 2022.It’s a youth tournament with pedigree: World No. 7 and 2014 Chevron Championship winner Lexi Thompson was twice a champion before she became one of the game’s elite players.Thompson became the youngest golfer ever to qualify for the US Women’s Open when she – at 12 years old – made it to the 2007 edition of the major.Simões still has a few attempts left to usurp that title but will have to wait at least another year after finishing tied-59th in the 67-player field. The Brazilian shot 23-over par, as two players – Lindy Duncan and Brooke Matthews – secured automatic qualification with scores of 10-under and 8-under respectively.The USGA announced a record number of entries for July’s championship, with 2,107 applicants from 47 US states and 62 countries dwarfing the previous record of 1,874 set last year, when Minjee Lee went on to clinch victory at Pine Needles.Players must have a handicap index of 2.4 or below, or be a professional, to attempt qualification. Several groups are exempt and receive an automatic invitation, including the last 10 champions and the top 75 players in the world rankings.Kimberly Williams, a 60-year-old pro from Bethesda, Maryland, was the oldest player to attempt qualification this year, according to the USGA.",sport,0.0

It was really disappointing. In a $10,000 [lower level] final you would speak.“It spoke for itself. We were upset when it happened and told during the trophy ceremony we weren’t able to speak. It kind of proved a point.”World No. 7 and last year’s winner Ons Jabeur called it “sad and unacceptable,” with former grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs labelling it a “disgrace.”“We sincerely apologize to all the players and fans who expect more of the Madrid Open tournament,” Gerard Tsobanian, CEO & Tournament Organiser of the Madrid Open said in a statement.“Not giving our women’s doubles finalists the chance to address their fans at the end of the match was unacceptable and we have apologized directly to Victoria, Beatriz, Coco and Jessica.”That marked the second time Azarenka had criticized tournament organizers during this year’s edition of the Madrid Open after a fan posted two photos on Twitter showing the difference in size of the birthday cakes given to Alcaraz and Sabalenka, who share a birthday on May 5.Azarenka replied to the tweet, saying: “Couldn’t be more accurate on the treatment.”That drew a response from tournament director Feliciano López, a former world No. 12 and seven-time winner on the ATP Tour, who said he was “surprised by this reaction after this gesture.”Explaining the reasons for Alcaraz getting a multi-tiered cake and Sabalenka getting a single-tier cake, López said it was because Alcaraz had just reached the final, was playing on the main court and that he is the home favorite for the Spanish tournament.“PS: I hope Rune wasn’t also upset by his treatment,” he finished, accompanied by a winking emoji and a photo of men’s player Holger Rune also receiving a single-tiered cake earlier in the tournament.Lopez wasn’t immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN Sport.",sport,0.0

The six-foot-11-inch Serbian moved past NBA Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain to stand alone at his position with the achievement.After the convincing victory, Jokić was quick to focus on the win, rather than his personal milestone.“To be honest, I just like to win the game, so whatever it takes,” Jokić – who is now averaging 35 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in the series against the Suns – told reporters.However, Nuggets head coach Michael Malone was much more effusive.“Nikola never forces anything. I mean, he’s a guy that literally will just read the game and take what the game offers,” Malone said.“I think sometimes we may take Nikola Jokić for granted because what he is doing is just incredible every single night.”Game 5 took place just two days after Jokić shoved Suns owner Mat Ishbia in Phoenix – but the pair appeared to make up before Tuesday’s game with an embrace.After an even first half, the Nuggets took control of Game 5 in the third quarter, exploding for 39 points while tensions rose between the two squads.Kevin Durant shoved Jokić in the quarter after Denver’s guard Bruce Brown appeared to be trying to glean information from a Suns huddle. Both Durant and Brown were assessed technical fouls for the incident.By midway through the fourth quarter, the Nuggets had a lead of over 20 points and the Suns pulled their starters and waved the white flag.Brown provided a key thrust for Denver throughout, scoring 25 points off the bench, something Jokić was keen to praise.“He can push the pace, he can defend, he can go downhill, and he had 10 free throws,” Jokić said. “Going downhill, breaking that first line of defense … He was really good today.”Both Michael Porter Jr. and Jamal Murray added 19 points apiece.Devin Booker led the way for the Suns with 28 points while Durant added 26 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists.The home team has now won every game in the series so far, with Game 6 taking place in Phoenix on Thursday.Despite the loss and facing elimination, Booker says he is confident his side can bounce back again, just like they have done before.“Yeah. I’ve been in here a couple of times now,” Booker told reporters. “I love it.“Every game has its own character. Every game is its own movie, its own different preparation and everything to go with it. We’re going watch over film, see how we can be better for Game 6.”",sport,0.0
669,693,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/sport/joel-embiid-journey-nba-mvp-2023-spt-intl/index.html,‘Trust the process’: Joel Embiid’s ‘improbable’ journey from newcomer to NBA MVP,2023-05-09 06:48:00,"At a Summer League in Las Vegas, a towering figure perched next to basketball trainer Drew Hanlen and introduced himself.“I already know who you are,” Hanlen retorted – the formidable figure needed no introduction.By the time the pair met, Joel Embiid had made a name for himself as one of the most exciting young prospects in the NBA, but he was still an unrefined talent.The Cameroonian was also coming off the back of missing two whole seasons through injury and there were doubts over how long he had been playing the game.“He missed the first couple of years, and nobody really knew what to think,” long-time Philadelphia 76ers play-by-play commentator Marc Zumoff explains to CNN Sport.“He was an unpolished product to begin with, having played really part of only one year at Kansas. And everybody knew he took up the game at 15. You wondered, ‘Well, yeah, there’s potential there, and physically he has the chance to grow into a body that could be pretty imposing. But who is this guy?’”Hailing from Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, Embiid only picked up basketball in his mid-teens when he was invited to a camp hosted by then NBA player and fellow Cameroonian Luc Mbah a Moute.“They could see something in me [and] I got a spot at the Basketball Without Borders camp in South Africa,” Embiid explained to The Players’ Tribune. “Two months later, I was on a plane to Florida to go to high school in America.”Embiid had been hooping for less time than many middle-schoolers, but Hanlen knew from that very first conversation it would not be long before the newly crowned MVP would reach another level.When hearing the trainer was on his way back to Los Angeles, the 76ers star joked that he would join the young coach in the City of Angels – at least Hanlen thought he was only joking.“A couple of hours later, I was getting calls from his agent and his manager,” Hanlen tells CNN Sport. “Joel had basically told them, ‘Figure it out, I want to work.’”The pair sorted a time, and the next day Embiid was in LA having his first of many workouts with Hanlen.This work ethic has stayed with the 29-year-old throughout his time in the NBA and is something that Zumoff says was always plain to see.Zumoff was the Sixers’ play-by-play man for over 25 years and saw Embiid’s desire to improve from up close. The 67-year-old saw “a lot of sweating with assistant coaches and anybody else who dared to put a body on him.”Hanlen reiterates this and says the Sixers big man is constantly searching for ways to improve.“He’s the biggest film nerd there is in the NBA,” Hanlen laughs. “We’ve watched every single made field goal of Kobe Bryant, of Shaquille O’Neal, of Hakeem Olajuwon, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant,” Hanlen stops before naming any other greats.This is another of the countless examples Hanlen has to emphasize Embiid’s need to be better.Hanlen smiles while explaining how ‘The Process’ had watched every single Nowitzki field-goal on tape and was still asking for more footage of the former Dallas Mavericks star.Embiid’s obsession doesn’t stop there. On late night journeys to and from the gym, Hanlen is forced to drive as the four-time All-NBA second-teamer sits in the passenger seat and watches every possible ‘meaningless’ League Pass game on his phone.It is no surprise that the seven-footer turned up to Hanlen’s sessions with the goal of being an elite defender, yet, fast-forward to the present day, he is now the most dominant offensive player in the NBA.Despite his ‘Joel Troel’ alter-ego, Embiid’s approach to the game shows he is everything but a joker who fools around.To partner with his MVP crown, the big man has won back-to-back scoring titles – the first center to do so since Hall of Famer Bob McAdoo 47 years ago.Embiid has demonstrated in those two years that he can score in every possible way despite his huge frame – his 33.1 points-per-game on 54.8% shooting from the field this season is an indicator of this.One of the reasons for this dominance is the hours spent watching tapes of the greats and then replicating them on the hardwood floor with Hanlen.“At times, you look at him and you’re like, ‘Man, he’s Shaquille O’Neal on the low block,’ and then you’ll see him in the mid post, and you’ll go, ‘Man, there’s a lot of Hakeem [Olajuwon] right there.’“Then you’ll see him facing up and you go, ‘Wait, is that the little bit of Kevin Durant?’ And then you see him move to the nail and you’ll say, ‘Oh, there’s Dirk Nowitzki.’ But the fact that he can steal the best aspects of all these great players and put it all into one is a testament to his hard work.”Hanlen grins as he explains he still struggles to believe that the clips of Embiid at high school and college are the same person he coaches today.Zumoff believes there was a moment when everything switched for the six-time All-Star.“My theory about Joel has always been that since he became a father to his son, Arthur, that really changed his outlook on life,” Zumoff says.Based on the MVP’s reaction to winning this year’s award, it seems he would agree.Speaking after being named MVP, Embiid said: “I’d say the biggest key of it is, obviously, I’m all about family. I don’t talk about it a lot. My son I would say is probably the biggest part of it.”It is clear that family is incredibly important to Embiid and, after speaking about his parents, he spoke about his son.“Arthur … losing my brother and then giving his name to my son meant a lot. My son is the reason why I’m really sitting here.”Zumoff can remember the exact moment he realized the importance of fatherhood to Embiid, when during a post-game interview, the Sixers commentator asked the two-time scoring champ about being a dad.“He proceeded to talk for about 90 seconds about the joy that fatherhood brought him, and then he turned it to himself and said, having a son now and being a father has inspired him to show his son that when all is said and done, he would be known as one of the best players to ever play the game.“And if you take a look at his scoring stats since the birth of his son, they have been pretty good,” Zumoff understates.Arthur is named after Embiid’s late brother who passed away shortly after the 2014 NBA Draft. This tragedy hit Embiid hard and speaking to The Players’ Tribune in 2020, he touched on this.“I thought about walking away from the game. I’m not exaggerating at all. I seriously considered retiring from the NBA before I’d even played one game.”Embiid added: “When you talk about my life, you have to talk about my brother Arthur. There’s no telling my story without him.”Despite his individual success, basketball is of course a team game and Embiid has had to endure some tough moments playing for the Sixers.Playoff defeats over the years garnered media attention and criticism aplenty, but Embiid’s desire to bring a championship home has never wavered.“His only goal is to win, you know, win a championship, bring a championship to the city of Philadelphia that’s embraced him from the second that he stepped foot in Philly,” Hanlen explains.“And every year, when he falls short of reaching that goal, we analyze the film, we break down what he can do better, and then he works on adding that aspect to his game.”Philly has already made Embiid an honorary Philadelphian, but winning a chip would secure his status in the City of Brotherly Love.“Philadelphia, I think, is one of, if not the most passionate sports city in the United States. And I say that because we really do consider our sports teams an important part of our fabric, our society, our culture and our commerce,” outlines Zumoff.“Because of that, we live and die with them, whether they win or lose. Yes, we do a lot of complaining and booing and whatnot, but that’s only because we care. If we didn’t care, we wouldn’t boo or we wouldn’t criticize.”For Zumoff, it is clear why Philadelphians have become so attached to their star man.“When you have a player like Joel Embiid, who is leading his team to victory and doing so in a way that is big and imposing and dominant, well, we love that because that’s what we’re all about.“We’re all about putting in the work. We’re about the blue-collar ethic and not taking any shortcuts. We see that with Embiid. And I’ll tell you what, we also see the joy that he plays with.”In a brilliant career so far, it is clear that Embiid’s journey to the Michael Jordan Trophy transcends more than just the sport of basketball itself.“If you’re looking for a word or phrase, I would literally say what he’s done in his career has been a miracle,” says Zumoff.“When you consider he didn’t start until he was 14 or 15, that he came from a culture that didn’t necessarily emphasize the game of basketball or had games available to watch all the time.“When you consider where he came from to what he’s become, it’s really nothing short of miraculous.”After becoming just the second African player to receive the honor of winning MVP, Embiid said something similar to reporters, adding: “For us Africans, we don’t have a lot of these opportunities.“The probability of us making it here is and let alone being an MVP is probably negative zero. But improbable doesn’t mean impossible.”Hanlen then summed up Embiid’s overall approach by saying: “I would just say he’s obsessed with greatness. He’s willing to do anything and everything to become the best possible player that he can ever become.”Whether Embiid can lead his team to a championship is a different story, but the MVP trophy has been a long time coming in one of basketball’s true fairytales and he can finally enjoy being recognized for his personal accomplishments.",sport,0.0
670,694,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/08/sport/sebastian-steudtner-big-wave-surfing-spt-intl/index.html,Sebastian Steudtner has turned to science as he chases the world’s biggest waves,2023-05-08 04:36:00,"Sebastian Steudtner holds the world record for the biggest wave ever surfed. At 26.21 meters (86 feet), it is equivalent to surfing an eight-story building.The record was set in the picturesque Portuguese fishing village of Nazaré, whose north beach has been hailed as the Mount Everest of big-wave surfing having been home to seven of the tallest 10 waves ever surfed.The German is a central figure in an international community of surfers who relocate to the west coast of Portugal each year for the season, which spans from October to March.But there is a method behind the 37-year-old’s apparent madness – he’s something of a surfing scientist in his approach to tackling the world’s roughest seas.He employs a military doctor and a trained lifeguard among his team and repeatedly thinks outside the box in his approach to catch the so far mythical 100-foot wave.Steudtner is also a central figure in a new book, “Nazaré: Life and Death with the Big Wave Surfers,” a first-hand insight into a season with this mercurial bunch of sportsmen and women.The below extract from the book sees how Steudtner’s alternative approach works from stepping inside a cutting-edge wind tunnel to helping inspire English Premier League football team Liverpool to past glories.—When Liverpool won the Champions League back in 2019, their manager Jürgen Klopp was left trying to uncover new ways to inspire his players and reinvigorate them after they’d already achieved the pinnacle of European football.In his quest to give them an additional psychological edge against their domestic rivals and to avoid his star-studded squad turning stale after their continental triumph, he reached out to Sebastian Steudtner, of all people.On the final day of the team’s preseason training camp in Evian, in southeastern France, and just days out from the start of the 2019/20 season, he asked his countryman to both give a team talk and also teach the footballers the sort of breathing techniques Steudtner himself uses in his pool training sessions and out in the big waves to stay alive.As well as teaching them aerobic exercises and breath control for when you’re in a state of panic, he also spoke about the whole mantra of staying calm under pressure.Klopp and captain Jordan Henderson have since paid tribute to the German surfer for the impact the exchange had on the players. Steudtner, for his part, brushes it all aside, in particular some articles that pushed the parameters of the story’s retelling to suggest the surfer was the mastermind of the Premier League title win that would subsequently follow.In the opening session in the pool that day, the breath-holding ranged from just 10 to 90 seconds at best. By the end of it, there was a straight duel for underwater supremacy between defender Dejan Lovren, who has since moved away from Anfield, and striker Mo Salah, with the pair nearing the four-minute mark by the end of it; Lovren was the last to surface.It was a session that clearly resonated with those there. For another defender, Virgil van Dijk, Steudtner’s messaging of dealing with pressure particularly had meaning. Comparing Steudtner’s experience of big-wave surfing to the relative triviality of his own big-game pressure, the Dutchman said, “He was like ‘One slight mistake and life could be over.’”Much like Klopp and Liverpool, in his own quest for self-improvement, Steudtner is always looking at avenues outside surfing, often casting his eye to methods from other sports and athletes in order to achieve even the most marginal of gains. Being injured and out of the water has given him even more time to do so.Boxing is probably the sport he turns to most, continually drawn back to it because of the parallels he sees between that sport and his own – and not just the poundings he takes.“It’s the same thing – you have to be prepared to die. That’s the first thing, at a certain level, and that’s not because boxers or surfers die left and right, but it’s the mentality you have to bring into the ring that has to be ‘I am going to kill you or you’ll kill me’ – full stop.”But the analogy goes beyond that. “It’s a dance, a strategy. It’s the most beautiful sport, nothing is more technical than boxing, nothing. I love boxing. If I didn’t get into surfing, for sure it would have been boxing.”At his height and weight, he would probably be in the lightweight division. You could comfortably envisage him being in the ring and, with his muscular frame, more than capable of holding his own, whomever the opponent.Russian and Mexican boxers are the fighters he most admires – the manner in which they strip their lives down to the most basic terms, taking themselves to a forest hideaway or some other Spartan existence for the most simplistic of pre-fight training camps.But the businessman in him also looks up to the British boxer Anthony Joshua perhaps more for the commercial acumen, which has seen the Briton accrue a net worth in the region of £200 million (around $250 million) and rising, than for what actually plays out between the ropes.Steudtner’s own business partnerships are partly financially driven, but they are also a symbiotic relationship aimed at improving the technical side of his surfing operation. No stone is left unturned during the course of the season; everything is aimed at him improving, even when not in the water.At the Porsche Development Centre in Weissach, just outside Stuttgart, he briefly takes over a wind tunnel. In place of the usual sports car stands his surfboard, with him on top of it. The German manufacturer uses its cutting-edge science from decades in the car industry to refine the aerodynamics of his body position, board and wetsuit.As the company’s scientists pore over the relevant data, they ascertain that even the slightest change of Steudtner’s position on the board can greatly improve the aerodynamics. It is an approach to the sport that no other surfer is currently undertaking. “It’s cool,” he says of the experiment. “They treat me like a car. And it’s an exciting process to test all these things and see what’s possible.”By his own admission, he is driven to pushing the limits of what might be achievable, even if much of his testing and tinkering fails to reach fruition. He admits, “OK, maybe 80 or even 90 per cent of new things don’t work – but that’s just how it is, always trying and trying. It’s the same with surfing. You try all the time and most of the time you fail.”On top of the wind tunnel operation, he is also partnering with Siemens as part of a research project on the biomechanics of big-wave surfing. It is a study that is not expected to be completed until some time in 2025.Steudtner ponders whether his unusual drive to push boundaries unlike his peers might be partly down to his own early influences and his adventurous nature growing up.As a child, his favorite place to go was his aunt and uncle’s farm, recollections of which bring an immediate smile to his face. There was fishing in the river – he and his sister catching them with sticks, like a real-life Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn – and they would kill their own chickens for the evening meal by chopping off the animals’ heads. For a then impressionable youngster, it was the ultimate adventure playground.The farming couple made a big impression on Steudtner too, and it still resonates today. He recalls the time his uncle accidentally cut his hand open, to the extent that blood was pouring out of a massive gaping wound. He simply sat down and stitched himself up. And his uncle’s motto of “If it’s my time, it’s my time” could just as easily apply to his nephew in his choice of profession.For Steudtner’s uncle, that day finally came at 64, when he dropped dead from a heart attack. The surfer’s aunt, meanwhile, lived on and was diagnosed with cancer at age 70. After undergoing initial treatment, she essentially said “Sod it,” defied regular medicine and pursued her own approach and has continued to confound medical expectation to live a decade beyond the doctors’ expectations.The family were originally very wealthy in the early 20th century, owning a large farm with hundreds of acres in a picturesque valley. His great-grandfather fought in World War I, and his grandfather in World War II, posted to Italy; the job of his battalion was to destroy any resources that remained in the area and ensure there was nothing left for the enemy to employ when they arrived.That largely involved him killing animals, a part of his life that perpetually haunted him for his remaining days and from which he never fully recovered, according to the family.As his grandson puts it, “He was never the same again.” In addition, it became known in the locality that he was no fan of Adolf Hitler. Word got out and, as the family story goes, someone snitched, which left the family on a deportation list. They avoided that fate when the war finished shortly afterward, he forgave his accuser and, like much of the rest of Germany, life simply moved on.The sleek lines of Steudtner’s glass-fronted new home in Nazaré, with its view overlooking the ocean, is in stark contrast to that old family farm. His roots, at least for much of the season, are here in Portugal, although it is only his seasonal home.His spell injured on the sidelines has given him plenty of moments of reflection on both his past and future – and yet he has no idea when that time will run out, when the drive to be in the big waves will diminish.As much as he itches to get back in the water, he seems to thrive in the face of adversity – right now, it’s the injury plight that drags on and on with still no end in sight. But in some ways, he likes it like that. Perpetually being at the top without a care in the world, he insists, would simply not suit him.He draws on another sporting parallel to highlight it. “It’s a constant chase, right? At a certain point, you have to run out of performance. It’s natural; it happens to everyone. Win, win, win or perform, perform, perform.Unless you’re someone like Lewis Hamilton that’s so obsessed, at a certain point, you’re done. If I was Lewis Hamilton, I’d be as bored as hell. How boring is it to win and win and win? Now things might have just got a bit more interesting for me.”For all his comments, there are still likenesses between him and the seven-time Formula One world champion. Only a year separates them in age, they have similarly spent a lifetime in their respective high-octane endeavors and both have railed against their sports. In Hamilton’s case, it is in terms of the lack of diversity in Formula One and wider motorsport.For Steudtner, safety remains his fight. But there is also the shared sense that whatever they achieve in their respective disciplines, it will never ever be enough.Complete fulfillment is hard for him to attain. His familiar refrain is, “I’m not satisfied” – and not just because of the current injury, the broken foot which put an end to his seasonal partnership with [fellow big-wave surfer Maya] Gabeira.He winds the clock back to his early days in Nazaré, only his second season, and one of the biggest days he can remember. The date is not important to him, just the recollection that both he and Tom Butler had surfed some of the best waves of his life, with the military doctor Axel Haber also in situ.Butler was bouncing off the walls in ecstasy as they began to pack up at the end of the day, while Haber was equally pleased for his two friends.For Steudtner, the sensation was different. Instead of celebrating the rush of that day’s water work, he was dissecting what he could have done better, lines he should have taken, how the session could have been improved, with half an eye on next time.Occasionally, it can gnaw away at him, but it is also the thing that has made him improve above all else. “It means you don’t enjoy the thing so much, but that’s why I improved a lot. I have friends in business and they say the same thing.”Butler’s absence still leaves a void in his life. Close friends and long-time surf partners, Steudtner would dearly love to have him back at his side. Finding a partnership that inexplicably clicks – as his with Butler did from the very outset – is hard to attain, but the Cornishman’s reappearance does not seem imminent at any point.While they are opposites – what Steudtner calls fire and ice – which equated to fighting like crazy at points, it somehow still clicked. Some relationships in Nazaré that shouldn’t work just do. “Tom is and will always be my brother. He’s genuine, he’s honest,” a facet he thinks there is not enough of in the town. Theirs is and always has been an unwavering loyalty to one another.And yet loyalty is not always a buzzword here in Nazaré. Steudtner is quick to point out that some “would stab each other in the back in a second” if it served their purposes, and he laughs at the nonsense of it all. It is not necessarily a criticism, just a reality of the sport and the waves that they all pursue in a perpetual quest for one-upmanship.He says of his profession: “It’s not like a basketball court, where it’s your turn. If there’s more surfers, that means less waves – and it’s a greedy sport. If I want to catch waves, I don’t think about you because you’re in my way, so you’re naturally competitive. There are all these vibes that happen in surfing, a localism like, ‘I was here first.’ You have to be a hunter and be competitive naturally.“It’s a myth that surfers are all chilled, smoke weed and help push each other into the waves. If you catch the biggest wave, you’ll get famous quickly. You’ve examples of Garrett [McNamara], Maya [Gabeira], me. It’s whatever you need to do or feel you need to do.”",sport,0.0
672,696,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/sport/russell-cook-africa-run-marathons-spt-intl/index.html,How one man is attempting to run the length of Africa … in just 240 days,2023-05-11 04:50:00,"Sweltering deserts, giant rainforests and dangerous wildlife are just some of the hurdles that Russell Cook says he’ll encounter as he attempts to complete the gargantuan task of running the length of Africa.Starting at the most southerly point in South Africa, the 26-year-old Briton is aiming to reach the most northerly point in Tunisia by Christmas – that’s the equivalent of running 360 marathons in 240 days.Supported by a small skeleton crew of friends, Cook will pass through 16 countries in what promises to be a physically demanding, mentally exhausting and logistically challenging expedition as he raises money for both The Running Charity and Water Aid.“Honestly, I’m actually not daunted by any of it,” Cook told CNN Sport on day 13 of his odyssey.“There’s no point worrying about it until it’s right in your face. We can plan and try to mitigate as much as we can along the way but none of these things keep me up at night. Handle the day, wake up, and handle tomorrow.”In the first two weeks of his trip, Cook ran over 50 kilometers per day through South Africa and has now crossed into Namibia where he’ll face the unrelenting Namib Desert.It’s a challenge beyond most people’s imaginations but not for Cook, who has earned the nickname “The Hardest Geezer.”He only found his running legs later in life, but has already completed some incredible feats – running from Istanbul to London and completing a marathon while pulling a car.But life hasn’t always been so remarkable for Cook and it’s the memory of a previous world that still motivates him.Like many young men, Cook struggled with his mental health as a teenager.Unable to find value in the multiple jobs he was doing to make a living, Cook says he felt trapped and would spend his time at weekends drinking with friends and gambling.His Damascene moment came at a nightclub in Brighton, England.Cook still remembers looking around at 3 a.m. and thinking that there must be more to life than this “proper dingy place.” It was a time to “fix up” and, in search of new horizons, he decided to run home.“It was like 12 miles and it took me probably three hours,” he says, laughing at his hazy memories of that night, as well as admitting to “taking little power naps on the pavement on the way home.”After that, a friend asked Cook to run a local half marathon. He completed it. He then thought he’d try a full marathon a few weeks later. He completed that as well.“For the first time in a long time, I felt confident,” says Cook.“That whole process of achieving something that previously seemed like I couldn’t do or that marathons are for crazy fit people. That could never be me. I’m not that guy. But then I became that guy.”Riding his new wave of motivation, Cook saved up enough money to go traveling. It was to be the next step on his journey of personal discovery and, in hindsight, one that would eventually lead him to his latest feat: Project Africa.On his travels, he visited the Kenyan town of Iten – home to some of the world’s very best long-distance athletes.Cook began to immerse himself in the local way of life and despite not being as quick as the professionals, he fell deeper in love with the “primal” art of running and the way it made his mind and body feel.The final piece of his jigsaw fell into place when, still in Africa, he met an Italian cyclist who was riding non-stop around the world.That conversation motivated Cook to start planning how he’d run the entire length of Africa – something he says has never been done before.“It just took a few years of smashing rock bottom, to start thinking: the only way I’m going to get out of this is by taking absolute responsibility for the situation that I’m in,” he says.“Trying to improve myself and then putting more positive energy out there, putting the work in, working on myself and and then slowly but surely, climbing the ladder.“Six years later and I’m in a bus in Africa getting beat down every day on the road instead!”Cook’s small team has run into problems at almost every part of the planning process, including visa issues and flying the support vehicle halfway across the world.The trip was initially going to be done in reverse but, always happy to adapt, Cook eventually arrived in Cape Town, South Africa, in late April and was excited to get going.From there, he has been chipping into the mammoth challenge one day at a time, overcoming any problems he encounters along the way.From blisters to smelly feet, there is seemingly nothing, big or small, that can throw him off his mission – so far.Cook even says that he persuaded two men not to rob him while he was running alone in South Africa and, such is his charming nature, he asked his team to give one of the would-be thieves a lift home.But when it comes to dealing with Africa’s often  wildlife, he has a plan – or so he says.“What if I saw a lion? Now, the answer I’d give to the internet is that I’d give it a firm double jab, right hook, left uppercut,” he says, laughing at his own bravado.“But if I’m being real with you, I’ll poo myself. I’ll say my final words to Jesus and then just close my eyes and hope for the best.”Cook spoke to CNN at the end of yet another grueling day of running. He had barely finished the last of his 50 kilometers before being bundled into the back of the support vehicle and having a laptop shoved under his nose.He even apologized for being slightly late – testament to a man who, despite his growing presence online, is grateful to anyone willing to show support.“I’m getting into the rhythm of things. The body has taken a few little niggles on the way to adjusting, but give it a couple more weeks and I’ll be swinging around every day,” the ever-positive Cook says, speaking of the physical demands of his challenge.“The nature of the beast is that this is never going to be comfortable. I try to remember that the situation I’m in is a blessed situation. I’ve worked so hard for so long to be able to get here.“From where I’ve come from to have this opportunity is absolutely incredible. What’s a few little sore bits in the legs? It’s all minor at the end of the day.“When I’m an old man, sitting in my rocking chair, with 18 grandchildren running around, I’ll have a few stories to knock back. So that will be good.”If Cook says he’s not worried about some of the obstacles – such as the Congo rainforest and Sahara desert – along the way, he does admit to worrying about funding his challenge.He says he’s currently running on fumes in that department, still using money given to him from a friend of a friend who had made his money in cryptocurrency.In the hope of getting more sponsorship, Cook and his team are documenting his journey on social media and have seen his online presence grow rapidly; his latest weekly YouTube video has over 50,000 views so far.While the outside world sees him posting daily motivational videos and posing for photos for his team, Cook spends hours on end with just his footsteps for company.“You obviously do get used to it. It’s like anything, you practice it enough and you just get better,” he says, explaining where his mind goes for long periods of the day.“I can pass through whole days just sitting in my own head. Part of the growth journey for me is becoming quite a peaceful person in myself.“I do often think about the future, you know, think about how we can make this better. A big stress is how are we going to get funding. So I’m always thinking about that.”With over seven months of the trip still to go, and with some of the hardest challenges still to come, Cook is not thinking about the finish line.Instead, he’s focused on “putting another brick in the wall” every day and making sure he enjoys the adventure when he can.Asked for his favorite moment to date, he recalled the time he was joined temporarily by a local 18-year-old boy who gave him the necessary boost while he was beginning to struggle in his first week of the trip.“Just having the opportunity to fly halfway around the world, get a few kilometers in with a boy who can give you a boost like that at the end of the day,” he says.“We’re from totally different worlds but, at that moment, we were just two lads running along.”Cook says he understands that people will be worried about him during the trip, but also says that loved ones know they can’t stop him.His appetite for adventure is ferocious but what’s most stark is his ability to strip back any pretense or sense of grandeur.Maybe as a way of managing the seemingly impossible task ahead, he simplifies everything he does.As long as his heart is beating, Cook says, he will be moving down the road; whether that be jogging, walking or crawling.",sport,0.0

Woods made the cut at Southern Hills, but – as at The Masters in April – subsequently withdrew after a painful third round. A nine-over 79, including five straight bogeys, saw him card a career-worst score at the event.Only five-time winners Jack Nicklaus and Walter Hagen have more PGA Championship victories than Woods, who defended his title at Tulsa in 2007 to clinch his fourth win at the tournament.Jordan Spieth will tee up at Oak Hill in his pursuit of a career grand slam, having withdrawn from this week’s AT&T Byron Nelson Classic in Texas due to a left wrist injury.The Dallas-born golfer expressed his disappointment at missing out on his home tournament under doctor’s orders for “rest and limited movement,” he said in a statement released to Twitter on Monday.Runner-up in 2015, the 29-year-old is a PGA Championship crown away from becoming only the sixth golfer to win all four majors in the modern era, after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Nicklaus, and Woods.To do so this month, Spieth will have to overcome a star-studded field headlined by Jon Rahm, who claimed his first green jacket at The Masters in dominant fashion at Augusta in April.The Spaniard tops the world rankings ahead of Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy, with the latter looking to add a third PGA Championship to his four-major haul.",sport,0.0

North Carolina is home to a range of snake species, many of which inhabit the waters of the Tar Heel state. Comments on the PGA’s Twitter post wavered on what species of snake Fowler handled, but it is thought to be a northern watersnake, a nonvenomous species native to North America.Angling his wedge, Fowler gently hooked the snake to lift it out from between a gap in the rocks before it slithered away. The fact that the 34-year-old is a long-time partner with Puma-Cobra made it a fitting collaboration.He eventually took a penalty drop but managed to save par, carding a three-under 68 before repeating the score on Sunday to finish tied for 14th at eight-under overall, 11 shots behind champion Wyndham Clark.It lifts him three places to world No. 50 ahead of the PGA Championship later at Oak Hill this month, where he will again chase a first career major after three runner-up finishes.Fowler will be hoping to avoid the fate that befell Richard Brand at last year’s event. The English golfer’s second round was derailed when a squirrel raced onto the green to stop his ball and roll it around before scampering away.To rub salt into the wounds, Bland was not allowed to move his ball or replay his shot under US Golf Association rulings.Snakes and squirrels have continued golf’s ever growing story of animal run-ins, with dogs, deer, and alligators all penning chapters in recent years.",sport,0.0

Moments later, the American tapped home to clinch the Wells Fargo Championship and his first ever PGA Tour title.“You only can win your first tournament once,” Clark reflected, but this was a victory played out in his imagination countless times.“It’s surreal, I’ve dreamt about this since I was probably six years old,” Clark told reporters in Charlotte, North Carolina.“Since I’ve been on the PGA Tour, you fantasize about it all the time, and I’ve done it multiple times this year where I catch myself daydreaming about winning.“To do it at this golf course against this competition is better than I could ever have imagined.”The manner of victory was the stuff of dreams too, as Clark carded 19-under to seal a four-shot victory over compatriot Xander Schauffele, ranked 75 places above him at world No. 5. It marked the second-lowest score in relation to par in the event’s history, second only to Rory McIlroy’s 21-under in 2015, according to the PGA Tour.McIlroy, making his first start since missing the cut at The Masters, finished 31st in a star-studded field featuring six of the world’s top 10.A final round three-under 68 sealed the 29-year-old Clark’s fourth consecutive round in the 60’s, a composed closer after a scintillating 63 on Saturday had given him a two-shot lead over Schauffele heading into the closing round.Having turned pro in 2017, Clark was five years and 133 PGA Tour starts without a win. After finishing sixth at the Corales Puntacana Championship in the Dominican Republic in March, the American began to think that he might never taste victory.“I know that sounds crazy because I’ve only been out here five years, but I had a lot of chances to where I was within two or three shots either going into the back nine or starting on a Sunday and I always seem to fall short, and not only that, but seem like I fell back in positions,” Clark admitted.“There was multiple texts and calls and times when I was so frustrated with people in my camp where I didn’t think I would ever win and I was like, ‘Let’s just stop talking about it,’ because I didn’t want to think about it. I said maybe that’s just not in the cards for me.“So being in the position this time, I was like, ‘Well, we know what not to do.’”Those lessons were tested immediately Sunday, as Clark opened with a bogey and remained at one-over approaching the eighth tee. However, a subsequent birdie, followed by four more across the first six holes of the back nine, saw him cruise home.When he rolled home his closing bogey, Clark looked overcome with emotion. After embracing his caddie and Schauffele, he looked to be holding back tears as he saluted the crowd gathered at the 18th.Victory secured Clark the $3.6 million winner’s prize – dwarfing his previous-best payday of $485,000 – and stamped his ticket to the 151st Open Championship at Royal Liverpool in July. It also saw his world ranking soar 49 places to No. 31.It fulfilled a dream that almost never got off the ground. When a 19-year-old Clark was establishing himself as a talented player at Oklahoma State University, his mother died of breast cancer.Clark lost his “rock” and seriously considered walking away from the sport entirely.“I was playing terribly,” Clark recalled. “There’s many times when I stormed off the golf course in qualifying or in tournaments and just drove as fast as I could, I didn’t know where I was going.“The pressure of golf and then not having my mom there and someone that I could call was really tough for me. Then professionally, I’ve had multiple moments like that where you just, you miss multiple cuts in a row or you feel like your game is good and you’re not getting much out of it and you just contemplate doing it [walking away].“Max Homa has a great quote: ‘Every golfer’s one shot away from thinking they can win the Masters or one shot away from quitting golf.’ It really is a great quote because that’s the truth. I’m glad I stuck it out and am here now.”",sport,0.0

He faces economic headwinds and criticism that the impact of the devastating February 6 earthquake was made worse by lax building controls and a shambolic rescue effort.His main opponent is CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who represents an election coalition of six opposition parties. For the first time, Turkey’s factious opposition has coalesced around a single candidate.A candidate must win over 50% of the vote on Sunday night in order to be elected. Otherwise Turkey will head to a run-off on May 28.Speaking to CNN from a polling station in Istanbul’s Beyogly district, voter Korhan Futaci, 46, said: “My vote is for freedom. My vote is for the future of our kids. I’m hopeful.”Yeliz Sahin, 46, whose brother and his son died in the earthquake, said: “It’s a historical moment that we’ve been waiting for for 20 years. This whole system needs to change.”Meanwhile first-time voter Eren Uzmele, 19, said: “The future of the country is in our hands. It’s in the hands of the youth.”Kılıçdaroğlu, a mild mannered 74-year-old former bureaucrat, has promised to fix Turkey’s faltering economy and restore democratic institutions compromised by a slide to authoritarianism during Erdogan’s tenure.Erdogan has been extolling the virtues of his long rule, campaigning on a platform of stability, independent foreign policy and continuing to bolster Turkey’s defense industry. Recently, he raised the wages of government workers by 45% and lowered the retirement age.Over the last two years, Turkey’s currency has plummeted and prices have ballooned, prompting a cost of living crisis that has chipped away at Erdogan’s conservative, working class support base.When a vicious earthquake on February 6 laid waste to large parts of southeast Turkey, Erdogan’s battled political aftershocks. His critics chastized him for a botched rescue effort and lax building controls that his ruling Justice and Development (AK) party presided over for two decades.In the weeks after the quake, the government rounded up dozens of contractors, construction inspectors and project managers for violating building rules. Critics dismissed the move as scapegoating.The government has also apologized for “mistakes” that were made in the immediate aftermath of the disaster.The quake claimed over 51,000 lives in Turkey and neighboring Syrian. Thousands are still unaccounted for, with unmarked graves peppering the southeastern Turkish countryside.On Thursday, Kılıçdaroğlu was boosted further by the late withdrawal from the race of a minor candidate, Muharrem Ince. Ince had low polling numbers but some opposition figures feared he would split the anti-Erdogan vote.Turkey holds elections every five years. More than 1.8 million voters living abroad already cast their votes on April 17, Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah reported Wednesday, citing the country’s deputy foreign minister. Over 65 million Turks are eligible to vote.The Supreme Election Council (YSK) chief Ahmet Yener said last month that at least 1 million voters in quake-stricken zones are expected not to vote this year amid displacement.",world,0.0

Both also live in exile, with Thai courts sentencing them to prison on corruption charges in their absence.Thaksin’s youngest daughter, 36-year-old Paetongtarn is standing as a prime ministerial candidate.Paetongtarn only entered politics three years ago but has presented herself as hailing from a new generation to connect with young Thais. She regularly attended rallies while pregnant and went back to campaigning days after giving birth.Enormously popular among the rural and urban working classes, the party is aiming for a landslide victory. Parties associated with Thaksin have won every Thai election since 2001.“I think people need change of course, they will come out no matter the weather; they are out and they want to use their rights,” Paetongtarn told reporters after she voted on Sunday. “I think everyone should notice this and it is very important for them.”Also in the mix for Pheu Thai is Srettha Thavisin, a 59-year-old real estate tycoon who wants to focus on fixing income inequality, promoting LGBTQ+ rights including same-sex marriage and rooting out corruption while boosting the sluggish economy.Speaking to CNN after casting his vote, Srettha encouraged “all Thais, as many as possible, to use their rights and come out to vote.”He added that he would be watching the counting process later in the day at the party’s headquarters in Bangkok.Another opposition force at play is the Move Forward party – hugely popular among young Thais for its radical reform agenda.Analysts have called it “a game changer” – its candidates are campaigning on deep structural changes to how Thailand is run, including reforms to the military and the kingdom’s strict lese majeste law – which prohibits criticism of the royal family and makes any open debate about its role fraught with risk.Heading the party is Pita Limcharoenrat, 42, a Harvard alumni with a background in business. His eloquent campaign speeches and reform platform have earned him a massive following and he is one of the top picks for prime minister in opinion polls.Gunning for the top job is incumbent Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha – this time with a new political party, the United Thai Nation. The former army chief who masterminded the 2014 coup has now been in power for nine years.Prayut arrived at a polling station in Bangkok with an entourage to cast his vote on Sunday.While his party lost out to Pheu Thai in the number of seats won in the 2019 election, Prayut still became Prime Minister after gathering enough support from coalition parties to form a government.But despite his poor performance in opinion polls, analysts have cautioned against underestimating him given his links to the country’s elites.His rise from military coup leader to prime minister has been marred with controversy, growing authoritarianism and widening inequality.Hundreds of activists have been arrested during his leadership under draconian laws such as sedition or lese majeste.His military government’s mismanagement in handling of the coronavirus pandemic and economy also amplified calls for Prayut to step down and continued well into 2021.He survived several no-confidence votes in parliament during his term which attempted to remove him from power.If elected again, Prayut can only serve two years as the constitution limits a term in office to a maximum eight years.Another candidate who could see his fortunes rise in any post-election wrangling is former army chief Prawit Wongsuwan, first deputy prime minister and former brother in arms with Prayut.Prawit, a political veteran, is now leader of Prayut’s old party Palang Pracharat.The Bhumjaithai party’s Anutin Charnvirakul could also prove influential in any post-election deals. Health Minister Anutin steered the country through the pandemic and was behind landmark legislation that decriminalized cannabis in the country last year.The head of the biggest party may not necessarily lead Thailand, or even form a government, because the country’s electoral system is heavily weighted in favor of the conservative establishment.Parties winning more than 25 seats can nominate their candidate for prime minister. Those candidates will be put to a vote, with the whole 750-seat bicameral legislature voting.To be prime minister, a candidate must have a majority in both houses – or at least 375 votes.However, the 250-seat member Senate is likely to play a key role in deciding the next government of Thailand and, because it is chosen entirely by the military, it will likely vote for a pro-military party.That means an opposition party or coalition need almost three times as many votes in the lower house as a military party to be able to elect the next leader.Polls are scheduled to close at 5 p.m. Bangkok time (6 a.m. ET) and vote counting will begin shortly after. Observers say that early results can be expected at midnight in Bangkok – but it could be weeks or even months until Thailand sees a new prime minister.",world,0.0

So we are hoping for the best but are preparing for the worst.”Evacuations of people in low-lying areas or those with serious medical conditions had begun, he said.In Myanmar, residents in coastal areas of Rakhine state and Ayeyarwady region have started to evacuate and seek shelter at schools and monasteries.Hundreds of Red Cross volunteers are on standby and the agency is relocating vulnerable people and raising awareness of the storm in villages and townships, the IFRC’s Kafley said.The last storm to make landfall with a similar strength was Tropical Cyclone Giri back in October 2010. It made landfall as a high-end Category 4 equivalent storm with maximum winds of 250 kph (155 mph).Giri caused over 150 fatalities and roughly 70% of the city of Kyaukphyu was destroyed. According to the United Nations, roughly 15,000 homes were destroyed in Rakhine state during the storm.About 1 million members of the stateless Rohingya community, who fled persecution in nearby Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2017, are living in the sprawling and overcrowded camps in Cox’s Bazar.Most live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides.Jain said the shelters can only withstand wind speeds of 40 kph (24 mph) and he expects winds from Cyclone Mocha to exceed that.“Low lying areas of the camps are likely to flood rapidly, destroying shelters, facilities such as learning centers, as well as infrastructure such as bridges that have been constructed with bamboo,” he said.The cyclone adds to an already disastrous year for the Rohingya, and without more funds from the international community, Jain said they won’t have enough to rebuild.“They faced a 17% cut in their food rations earlier this year due to funding cuts and we expect a further cut in their rations in the coming months. 16,000 refugees lost their home in a devastating fire in March. And now they must deal with the cyclone. Unfortunately, we don’t even have the funds to help refugees rebuild their homes and facilities if the devastation is severe,” he said.There are also concerns for 30,000 Rohingya refugees housed on an isolated and flood-prone island facility in the Bay of Bengal, called Bhasan Char. The UN refugee agency said volunteers and medical teams are on standby and cyclone shelters and food provisions are available for those living on the island.In Myanmar, about 6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Rakhine state and across the northwest, with 1.2 million displaced, according to the UN humanitarian agency.The past few decades have seen an increase in the strength of tropical cyclones affecting countries in parts of Asia and recent research predicts they could have double the destructive power in the region by the end of the century.While scientists are still trying to understand ways climate change is affecting cyclones, a slew of research has linked human-caused global warming to more potent and destructive cyclones.Tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms depending on ocean basin and intensity), feed off ocean heat. They need temperatures of at least around 27 degrees Celsius (80 Fahrenheit Fahrenheit) to form, and the warmer the ocean, the more moisture they can take up.The waters in the Bay of Bengal are currently around 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit Fahrenheit), about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than average for May.As the climate crisis pushes up the temperatures of oceans – which absorb around 90% of the world’s excess heat – it provides ideal conditions for cyclones to gain strength.Warmer oceans also increase the chances of cyclones rapidly intensifying, according to recent research.Climate-change fueled sea-level rise adds to the risks, worsening storm surges from tropical cyclones and allowing them to travel further inland.Bangladesh and Myanmar are particularly threatened because they are low-lying, as well as being home to some of the world’s poorest people.",world,0.0

I cannot tell you (when)… but you will definitely see it and Russia will definitely feel it,” he said. “We believe in victory and believe that the first important steps will be taken soon.”A senior US military official and a senior Western official told CNN last week that Ukrainian forces had begun “shaping” operations in advance of the counteroffensive.Shaping involves striking targets such as weapons depots, command centers and armor and artillery systems to prepare the battlefield for advancing forces. It’s a standard tactic made prior to major combined operations.Describing a “long and fruitful” meeting with Zelensky Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni pledged unwavering support for Ukraine, adding that Rome would back any future bid by Kyiv to join NATO.“We are ready to support a further intensification of Ukraine’s partnership with NATO, we will discuss it in Vilnius at the July summit, it will probably be the central theme” Meloni said.Earlier, Zelensky met with Pope Francis, who has been outspoken in his support for an end to the war in Ukraine.In their meeting at the Vatican Saturday, Zelensky and Francis spoke about the humanitarian and political situation in Ukraine caused by the war and the Pope assured his “constant prayer,” according to a statement from the Vatican’s press office.“Both agreed on the need to continue humanitarian efforts to support the population,” the statement said.Zelensky said last week that his country still needs “a bit more time” before it launches the counteroffensive, in order to allow some more of the promised Western military aid to arrive in country.Among those Western backers is Germany, where Zelensky arrived on Sunday in his first visit to the country since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began last February.“Already in Berlin. Weapons. Powerful package. Air defense. Reconstruction. EU. NATO. Security,” Zelensky wrote on Twitter.Germany’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that it would supply Ukraine with nearly $3 billion more in military aid, including 30 tanks.It comes after a major policy U-turn earlier this year which saw Berlin announce it would provide Kyiv with Leopard 2 battle tanks. Germany had initially resisted calls to provide weaponry to Ukraine in line with Berlin’s decades-long policy of not supplying lethal weapons to crisis zones.As Zelensky toured Europe, Russia’s assault on Ukraine continued.Two people, including a 15-year-old girl, were killed and 10 others wounded Saturday as a result of Russian shelling in the eastern city of Kostiantynivka, Ukrainian officials said on Telegram.In western Ukraine, at least 21 people were injured following Russian strikes on the city of Khmelnytskyi  in the early hours of Saturday, Ukrainian authorities said.Ukraine’s Air Force said Saturday that 17 out of 21 Russian drones had been intercepted overnight by its air defense system but they were unable to prevent strikes on infrastructure facilities in Khmelnytskyi.In nearby Ternopil, two people were injured after Russian missiles struck warehouses and a religious organization, local authorities said on Telegram.The attack came as Ternopil-based electronic duo Tvorchi performed at the Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool, England. The Ukrainian representatives finished sixth.Meanwhile, a Russia-backed official in Luhansk said two people were hospitalized after a second missile attack in 24 hours on the the occupied eastern region.In a Telegram post, Darya Lantratova, an official with the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic, said the apparent Ukrainian attack was carried out with Storm Shadow cruise missiles“There were casualties, including civilians. Preliminarily, two people are hospitalized. The military reports that Storm Shadow cruise missiles carried out the strikes,” she said.Ukraine has not made any official comment on the use of Storm Shadow missiles since Britain announced it had supplied Kyiv with the weapons earlier this week.",world,0.0

Rockets continued to be fired from Gaza in the minutes after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect, a CNN producer in the strip heard.More than an hour after the time the ceasefire was due to take effect, sirens continued to sound in Israel, warning of incoming rocket fire, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched more airstrikes on targets in Gaza, minutes before the ceasefire was due to come into effect.The head of Israel’s National Security Council Tzachi Hanegbi thanked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi Saturday night, and expressed Israel’s appreciation for Egypt’s vigorous efforts to bring about a ceasefire, a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said. Hanegbi was acting on the guidance of Netanyahu, the statement said.Hanegbi said Israel’s response to the Egyptian initiative means “quiet will be answered quietly, and if Israel is attacked or threatened, it will continue to do everything it needs to do in order to defend itself.”Hamas, the militant Palestinian movement that runs the Gaza Strip, issued a statement praising Palestinian resistance factions after the ceasefire appeared to take hold.Hamas “hails the Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance Factions for defending the Palestinian people against the most recent Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip,” Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasem said.He added that “the unity of the Palestinian resistance is evidence of the Israeli occupation’s failure to provoke strife within the resistance.”In a statement, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland welcomed the ceasefire and urged “all sides” to observe it.“I look forward to the immediate restoration of humanitarian access and all social and economic measures to support Palestinian livelihoods in Gaza,” he added.The violence this week left at least 33 Palestinians dead in Gaza and at least two people in Israel – an Israeli woman and a Palestinian man from Gaza working in Israel.Word of the agreement came near the end of a day of intense fighting. A rocket launched from Gaza killed a Palestinian man working in Israel and seriously wounded another, Israel medical authorities said Saturday, as cross-border fire showed little signs of easing.The two men were working in the Negev desert in southern Israel and were hit by shrapnel. IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht tweeted Saturday that the two men were brothers.The Palestinian man who died is the second death in Israel due to rocket fire from Gaza since hostilities broke out on Tuesday morning.The incident came as Israel’s military pounded targets in Gaza Saturday while Palestinian militants fired more rockets.The IDF said it launched a series of attacks on sites which it said belong to Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip.Israel accuses the group of planning attacks and since the flare-up began on Tuesday has killed six of its commanders.In a televised speech following the ceasefire, Islamic Jihad’s secretary general Ziyad al-Nakhala acknowledged those losses and said the group was prepared to take up arms in the future.“We are emerging from this battle with our weapons in our hands, and our fighters are still in the field, ready at all times to fight any aggression,” he said.Islamic Jihad is the second largest armed group in Gaza after Hamas.More than 1,200 rockets have been launched so far at Israel, said the IDF, which has struck more than 370 targets in Gaza as part of its “Shield and Arrow” campaign, in its fifth day as the ceasefire was declared.Videos from Gaza showed that the airstrikes appeared to have also hit at least two civilian homes in the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday, but no injuries were reported.Asked about the latest strikes by CNN, the IDF said that in the last 24 hours, they struck operational residences used as headquarters and command and control centers by the Jihad terrorists.In its statement, the military said IDF fighter jets and aircraft struck launching sites for mortar shells and rockets “used by Islamic Jihad to fire projectiles toward Israel over the last few days.”On Friday, at the beginning of an operation the al Quds Brigades of Islamic Jihad called “Revenge of the Free,” Palestinian militants launched rockets towards Jerusalem for the first time, as well as Tel Aviv and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.Clashes also took place on Saturday morning in the occupied West Bank and at least two Palestinian men were killed, Palestinian officials said.Sa’ed Jihad Shaker Mashah, 32, and Adnan Waseem Yousef Al-Araj, 19, were shot in the head with live bullets, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. At least three other people were injured, the ministry said.The clash took place in the Balata refugee camp near Nablus in the northern part of the West Bank.The IDF and Shin Bet security agency said IDF and Israel Border Police forces were raiding “a hideout belonging to terror operatives” in the camp.",world,0.0

Hosting honors will go to winners Sweden next year.The UK put on a dramatic and moving show that paid tribute to those displaced by war and celebrated the music of both countries. But a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to address the show was rejected, organizers said Friday.Ukraine’s electronic duo Tvorchi finished a strong sixth place, while Britain returned to its traditional position toward the bottom of the leaderboard, ranking 25th – the penultimate spot.Sweden’s winning act, Loreen, told CNN ahead of the final that her first victory was “one of the most important moments in my life.”“Before ‘Euphoria,’ I was a struggling artist trying to find my way,” she said. “It’s like home for me, the Eurovision community,” the singer added. “It’s a safe space for me.”She is the first woman to win the contest twice; only Ireland’s Johnny Logan has done so before.“It feels crazy,” she said after her victory was announced. “This is so surreal, man, I’m happy and I’m thankful, I’m thankful to all you guys out there that voted for me.”“The only thing I feel right now is so much love. Not in my wildest dreams did I think this was going to happen,” she said.But she had to beat strong competition from Finland’s rapper Käärijä, whose energetic performances of “Cha Cha Cha” throughout the week have wowed fans and made him a strong contender to win the crown.The top five was rounded out by Israel, Italy and Norway.Around the host city of Liverpool, Eurovision fans without tickets rammed into venues to watch the show on big screens, many of them waving Ukrainian flags.The British government made 3,000 tickets available at discounted prices this week for displaced people from the country.Eurovision is a famously eccentric festival, and this year’s show lived up to the billing with an array of strong performances from 26 finalists.It also catapulted the dockside city of Liverpool – the home of the Beatles – onto the continent’s cultural map.“I knew if we wanted to do this, it wasn’t just to tick boxes for Ukraine. We wouldn’t just put up some posters,” Claire McColgan, Liverpool’s director of culture, told CNN in the buildup. “What you see in the city is a real Scouse-Ukrainian mashup, which is what we wanted.”",world,0.0

Over 100 people are set to attend and a dance troupe are set to perform, according to the news release.Costa told Guinness that Bobi has been enjoying a lot of attention since being crowned the world’s oldest dog.“We’ve had a lot of journalists and people come from all over the world to take a picture with Bobi,” he said in the release.He added that the senior pup was in good health and recently received a check-up due to Costa’s concerns about the stress of frequent visitors.“There were a lot of pictures taken and he had to get up and down many times,” he said in the release. “It wasn’t easy for him.”Bobi is a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, a breed of Portuguese dog trained to guard livestock, according to his owner. As he’s gotten older, he has had difficulties walking and also experienced a decline in his eyesight.Costa attributed his dog’s longevity in part to the “calm, peaceful environment” where he lives.In addition to being the oldest dog currently living, Bobi is also the oldest dog ever recorded, according to Guinness. Costa was just 8 years old when his canine companion was born.“Bobi is special because looking at him is like remembering the people who were part of our family and unfortunately are no longer here, like my father, my brother, or my grandparents who have already left this world,” he said in the release.",world,0.0

It has got that war-worn feel, with shafts of sun slicing through the foliage.He is taking us to see recent battlefield gains around Bakhmut, Ukraine’s biggest military gains since it forced Russian troops out of Kherson last November.Summer is coming and everything around Ukraine’s front lines is changing. There is an energy and anticipation the war here is about to kick up a gear. The tracks we are walking on are drying out, the troop carrier that brought us in riding on rather than sinking into the hardening mud.Ukraine’s Western allies say shaping operations – essentially, out maneuvering the enemy – for a coming counteroffensive are already underway.Commanders won’t say if what we are about to see is part of that. Honza, however, is thrilled by their gains. “I love it, I love it” he says.Vietnam is a strong analogy to make. Artillery fire is as deadly now as it was then, but the battlefield of today’s war is a high-tech killing zone compared to what Vietnamese and US soldiers experienced.The trees that in the past few weeks have burst into full leaf hide our trail to the trenches from the probing gaze of Russian drones and the artillery fire they call in on Ukraine’s troops.In Vietnam the denser the wood, the greater the risk of enemy ambush, but here it is the opposite.As Honza leads us out into open fields a detonation to our left followed by a whistle has us all readying to fall to the floor. The shell arcs overhead and lands several hundred meters to our right.Mentally we are all mapping not just the visual terrain, but the audible too.We hear the sound everyone here dreads: the low whine of a drone. As high-tech as this war is, Honza and the others with us can’t tell if its Ukrainian or Russian.In his command bunker a couple of hours earlier he had shown us multiple drone video feeds of the battlefield searching for any possible Russian troops massing for a counterattack.The quality is incredible, each time a Russian soldier put his head out a trench we could see him. This war is like no other, both sides spying on each other in real time, better able to rain death on each other, if they have enough ammo and guns.As we sprint towards the welcoming mud steps of the closest trench another bit of the mental gymnastics of a frontline fighter is triggered – did the drone see us, do the Russians care to hit us right now, are we a worthwhile target, and are their guns and communications primed and ready for it.Below the trench’s camouflage netting we pause, regroup and chat about the new gains the frontline troops around us are defending.Honza is hungry for more action, “we all just want to take our territory back and kill maximum possible Russians we can.”“But you never used to love killing Russians, it must feel kind of crazy” I reply.“It feels crazy ” he says, “on maybe (the) first (or) second time, but then you will know it’s your mission its why you are here to defend your land.”In the trenches here, everyone knows when the counteroffensive comes it will be bloody and brutal but buoyed by the gains around them, fear of drones and artillery won’t hold them back.",world,0.0

We at Lion Guardians feel privileged to have borne witness to his life and his legacy,” it added.The organization attributes the long life of older wild lions in recent times, in a landscape where a “decade ago, we did not have lions surviving past age 10,” to the efforts of local communities that share the land with the big cats.A dramatic increase in the demand for energy and materials over the last 50 years has left humans and lions competing for space and resources, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) website.Lions will travel far, sometimes venturing outside of protected areas, to look for prey when their food source diminishes, and can pose a risk to human communities when they prey on their livestock. Farmers often kill them in retaliation or to prevent conflict.Loonkiito was unfortunately “caught up in this dynamic,” said Lion Guardians.Kenya has been experiencing its worst drought in four decades. The organization said that the end of a drought is commonly marked by an increase in human-lion conflict, since wild prey becomes harder to hunt and livestock owners are “particularly vigilant” after losing so many animals.This incident “was a tough situation for both sides, the people and the lion,” it added.",world,0.0

Lebanon is smaller than Connecticut and has a population of just six million. Few American tourists go to the country as the State Department has placed it on the third highest travel advisory level, but it does have a sizeable population of Lebanese American residents.“Did the US move to Lebanon??” tweeted Sandy, a social media activist.“Maybe you’ll have enough room to work on all those pending visa applications,” tweeted Abed A. Ayoub, national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, responding to the grandiosity of the new complex.Computer-generated images published by the embassy show an ultra-modern compound, hosting multi-story buildings with high glass windows, recreational areas, and a swimming pool surrounded by greenery and views of the Lebanese capital. The compound includes a chancery, representational and staff housing, facilities for the community and associated support facilities, according to the project’s website.From the pandemic to the 2020 Beirut blast, Lebanon has been assailed by a number of crises that have left its economy in ruins. Many Lebanese are unable to afford basic commodities, including food, medicine and electricity.“Let them eat concrete,” another user tweeted.Plans for the embassy complex were announced in 2015 and it is reported to have cost $1 billion.Its construction is overseen by the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), which supervised the building of a number of other US embassies around the world.The US embassy in Lebanon did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.The US has had a turbulent history with Lebanon. It is the home of Iran-backed Hezbollah, the most powerful group in the country, but has nonetheless enjoyed friendly relations with the US.Last month marked 40 years since the 1983 bombing of the American embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, including 52 Lebanese and embassy employees.

Now, scientists have unveiled a new blueprint that better captures the richness of human diversity.The original human genome was predominantly based on one anonymous individual, who responded to an ad calling for project volunteers that appeared in The Buffalo (New York) Evening News in March 1997.Each person’s genome varies slightly — by less than a percentage point compared with that of the next person — but many genetic variants remain hidden to researchers because of the reliance on a single reference genome.A new “pangenome” incorporates the DNA of 47 individuals from every continent except Antarctica and Oceania. The scientists involved said the update will improve our ability to diagnose disease and understand the genetic variants that lead to ill health, among other advances.Getting a good night’s rest can make all the difference. NASA requires that astronauts get 8½ hours of sleep per night on missions to avoid long-term sleep loss, fatigue-induced errors and health complications.Proper shut-eye in zero gravity can be challenging, and astronauts on board the International Space Station struggle with sleep issues just like people on Earth.Fortunately, the Fatigue Countermeasures Laboratory at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, is developing tools to help astronauts overcome sleep challenges.Led by Dr. Erin Flynn-Evans, the lab also conducts simulated space missions to understand how crew members might perform when sleep is restricted while living on Mars or the moon.The Voyager space probes took off in 1977. These record breakers are the only two human-made objects outside the protective bubble of our sun, sending back priceless data about interstellar space.Their long-distance cosmic treks weren’t planned — the two spacecraft were originally designed to operate for four years. Suzanne Dodd, Voyager’s project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, calls them her “senior citizens.”“I kind of describe them as twin sisters,” Dodd said. “One has lost its hearing, and it needs some hearing aids, and another one has lost some sense of touch.

708,732,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/13/uk/eurovision-song-contest-2023-grand-final-cmd-gbr-intl/index.html,Lobsters! Saunas! Smoothies! A complete guide to Eurovision 2023,2023-05-13 11:02:00,"“People say I’m a funny guy,” Finnish rapper Käärijä says, reclining in the sauna truck he had shipped across northern Europe, wearing only some tight leather shorts, a set of spiky green sleeves and an aggressive bowl cut.“But I always tell them: I’m just a normal guy from Finland.”Käärijä is not a normal guy; he’s an infectious ball of zeal in a head-swiveling get-up, with a laugh that cuts through the steam in his sweaty private hangout. But at Eurovision, he’s just the latest in a long line of eccentrics to capture the continent’s music-loving hearts.“I just want to make people happy when I walk on stage and do my crazy things,” Käärijä says, clearly more comfortable in the heat than this CNN reporter. “After this, you have to go shower,” he tells me plainly.The Eurovision Song Contest -- the brightest, gayest and most heartwarming event of the year in Europe – is a magnet for many of the region’s otherworldly musical acts. Each year it receives more than 150 million TV viewers worldwide and brings swarms of fans to its host city – which this year is Liverpool, England, handling proceedings on behalf of last year’s winner Ukraine.Its Grand Final will air live on Saturday night at 8 p.m. BST (3 p.m. ET) and will see one country crowned this year’s winner.Even here, Käärijä’s reputation precedes him. “The Finland guy – he has a different vibe,” Lithuania’s contestant told CNN. “When he comes out, it’s dramatic,” Armenia’s added.Käärijä brags about downing multiple Pina Coladas in his power-rap “Cha Cha Cha,” a track that becomes dramatically less intimidating once its lyrics are run through Google Translate. “I’m not afraid of this world … when I pour champagne on myself,” he warns us.That unfazed demeanor will serve him well against serious competition. If you believe the bookmakers, he’s locked in a two-horse Nordic showdown with Loreen, Sweden’s returning Eurovision royalty, whose 2012 uber-banger “Euphoria” transcended the contest and became a club staple around Europe.Winning more than a decade ago was “one of the most important moments in my life,” Loreen told CNN. “Before ‘Euphoria,’ I was a struggling artist trying to find my way.”Now, she’s one of Eurovision-mad Sweden’s most celebrated entrants ever – perhaps just one victory away from getting her own money-making hologram. Or as she puts it: “I’m a servant of creativity, darling.”“It’s like home for me, the Eurovision community,” Loreen said. “It’s a safe space for me.”In many ways, the battle for this year’s crown symbolizes the two extremes on offer at Eurovision – a polished vocalist with a minimalist, TV-friendly performance going up against a cacophony of delightful Eurosilliness.But Eurovision has a bit of everything. “This is like the perfect salad of music,” Lithuania’s Monika Linkytė tells CNN.  Pi, a member of Germany’s pop metal outfit Lord of the Lost, says Eurovision “reminds me of the ‘Hunger Games’ – but you swap the death for joy, and you swap the competition for companionship.”Everyone is talking about energy – their energy, the energy of the crowd, the energy of their home countries. Loreen used the word 11 times in a 12-minute interview. There’s so much energy in Liverpool it’s a miracle the lights in the arena haven’t tripped.Amid the love and joy and energy, though, there’s competition – and some acts have already been jettisoned at the semi-final stage.Ireland’s Wild Youth, fronted by an Elvis Presley waxwork that someone left in the sun, failed to generate much enthusiasm with “We Are One” – a song that reads like a ChatGPT-generated ode to meaninglessness, and sounds like a commercial for a supermarket’s range of barbecue equipment.“The truth is they never give Ireland a chance,” the band grumbled in a since-edited Instagram post that went down like a lead balloon among the masses in Liverpool.Only the strongest 26 contestants can proceed, and the diversity on show is staggering. We have former contestants from the Albanian version of “The Voice,” the Swiss version of “The Voice,” the Georgian version of “The Voice,” and a winner of “Estonian Idol” who can also boast an appearance on the Baltic-region version of “The Voice.”Many acts are legitimate stars in their home countries, but Eurovision is the great equalizer – so behind every artist is a team of publicists furiously attempting to talk up their talent.Portugal claims that its singer Mimicat, a real estate agent in a previous life, has “a ‘sassy-badass’ stage presence,” a claim CNN could not independently verify. Georgia’s Iru has been “drowned in music” from an early age, the poor thing. Serbia’s Luke Black doesn’t just make music; he “shapes his own destiny” with “storytelling wrapped in cinematic sounds.” He’s also frequently pictured holding a lobster to his face, presumably for artistic reasons.Switzerland is less boastful – noting only that Remo Forrer has “solid vocal chords.”And here’s how Linkytė describes the meaning behind her ballad: “Everything that you have in your mind, it can actually be the truth, I guess. But we are putting so many doubts about the dreams we have that we are not receiving those dreams, mostly.” So that clears that up.This is, by the way, the most global Eurovision ever. For the first time, viewers all around the world can vote – and while few artists here would cite Tim McGraw or Toby Keith among their inspirations, Americans can still get involved if they watch along on Saturday.That’s news to Linkytė, though. “They can vote? Are you serious??” she screams. “Americans: I love you so much!”Brits don’t usually catch Eurovision fever quite as viscerally as their continental friends – perhaps because they haven’t had a winner this millennium – but hosting the show has changed that.And what a show it is: Last year’s winner and runner-up, Ukrainian rap group Kalush Orchestra and the UK’s Sam Ryder, will each perform on Saturday, as will Ukraine’s majestically unhinged 2007 entrant Verka Serduchka.Organizers said they rejected a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to address the show –though his office later claimed he had never made one – but Ukraine’s Tvorchi crushed their dress rehearsal on Friday and are hoping to send a message home.“We feel a huge sense of responsibility,” one member of the duo, Jeffery, tells CNN. “We know what we have to do; we know what mission we’re here for.”Flying the British flag is Mae Muller. As is the case with anything fun that happens in Britain ever, her selection briefly infuriated the country’s culture warriors, who expressed outrage after discovering she had once been critical of Boris Johnson. But blowback was softened by the fact that criticizing Johnson has arguably become the country’s most cherished pastime in the past year.Punk rockers Let 3 are famous for performing naked back home in Croatia. In Liverpool, they’ve made some really – unique? Let’s go with “unique” – costume choices.Lord of the Lost, meanwhile, provide the obligatory thrust of heavy metal. It may surprise you to learn they supported Iron Maiden on their European tour last year. (It may also surprise you to learn that Iron Maiden are still touring).But even their lead singer, Chris Harms, is a gentler form of Rock God. Harms has adopted several abandoned kittens – two of which are called Piwo, Polish for “beer” – whom he feeds with a milk bottle. “You can’t let them die, the little f**kers,” he told CNN.In the hometown of Lennon and McCartney, we have a real lyrical smorgasbord to please the ears on Saturday. Austria’s Teya & Salena tell CNN they went to Eurovision songwriting camp (that’s a thing in Europe, you guys) to create their entry, which describes being inhabited by the ghost of 19th century writer Edgar Allan Poe.“Maybe someone out there knows where Shakespeare is so I can get a taste,” they sing as they thrash their way through the English-language literary canon.The deadline to finalize entries came too soon for Armenia’s Brunette, who accidentally submitted the world’s most insufferable Hinge bio instead. “I just wanna make art, read books and just find someone who likes me enough to kiss my face,” she sings. “I wanna explore with him and visit old bookstores.”The truth is, most artists don’t care about where they end up on the leaderboard after a long, draining, drunken evening on Saturday. “You’re talking to five guys who will win many hearts,” Harms says.Alas, not everyone has time for that airy fairy nonsense. “I expect to win,” Pasha Parfeni tells me. The bookies don’t agree. But Pasha is Moldova’s Eurovision Guy – he’s been here twice, entered the national selection another few times, and has co-written past entries.He’s “quite big” back home, he notes in a brooding voice, handing a vape to his media manager, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses. “I’m in love with all my songs,” Pasha adds – particularly this year’s. He even provides some totally impartial analysis, free of charge. “The meaning is pretty deep, we have a lot of layers here,” he says.Whoever wins, this year’s Eurovision has reignited Britain’s love for the contest and pulled together an incredibly strong selection of talent.And, of course, energy. Loreen says that if she wins, her first task will be to “send back some energies” to her team. “And I’m gonna have, maybe, a glass of wine.”",world,0.0

He remains in parliament.“I want to make sure the recent events do not interfere with the official visits and summits we are going to have with all the World Leaders in the coming weeks,” Tkatchenko said.“I also want to ensure the truth of this matter is cleared and the misinformation and lies are corrected,” he added.US President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are due on May 22 for what will be a historic visit.On Wednesday, Tkachenko said Biden would sign a defense pact with PNG, which is being courted by the United States and China amid a contest for influence in the Pacific islands region. Tkachenko had been closely involved in the US negotiations.Marape said in a statement on Friday evening he would take over supervision of preparations for the arrival of Biden, Modi and more than a dozen Pacific island leaders. He commended Tkachenko for putting the national interest first.Media and online news sites in PNG, a Pacific island member of the Commonwealth, have been running hot with insults and criticism of the cost of travel of a large PNG delegation of 30 people since Saturday’s coronation in London’s Westminster Abbey, with many saying the money would have been better spent on hospitals.Each delegate had a 50,000 kina ($14,000) allowance to cover hotels and airfares.Marape also said he wanted to apologize to Tkatchenko’s family, and especially his daughter Savannah for what he called “the traumatic experience over the last couple of days.”“No woman deserves to be treated the way Savannah was treated over the last few days,” he said.Tkatchenko’s daughter, who accompanied him on the trip, has become a focal point for anger after posting a TikTok video discussing luxury shopping before boarding a flight in Singapore.Earlier, Tkatchenko had apologized for remarks he made to the Australian state broadcaster, in which he called people criticizing his daughter on social media “primitive animals,” prompting a further backlash.Marape said it was a “poor choice of words.”Government House official secretary Bill Toraso confirmed to Reuters that 10 of the Governor General’s staff had traveled to London, in addition to 10 guests, and traveled separately to the government delegation. Two foreign ministry officials also traveled with Tkatchenko, who had been asked by Marape to represent PNG in his place.",world,0.0

Unfortunately, this is not yet in sight. Germany will therefore provide all the help it can - as long as it takes,” Pistorius added.Ukraine President’s Chief of Staff, Andriy Yermak, confirmed Germany’s support on Saturday via his Telegram account while thanking them for their aid.The development comes after the US on Tuesday announced a $1.2 billion aid package to Ukraine intended to “bolster its air defenses” and “sustain its artillery ammunition needs,” with Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russian forces looming.Germany’s military support for Ukraine has evolved over time. The country initially resisted calls to provide weaponry to Kyiv, agreeing only to provide humanitarian help and medical equipment. That approach was in line with Germany’s decades-long policy of not supplying lethal weapons to crisis zone.In a major policy U-turn earlier this year, Berlin announced it would provide Kyiv with Leopard 2 battle tanks. Then in April, Berlin also committed to sending Gepard anti-aircraft systems.Not everyone in Germany has been on board with their government’s decision, however, with thousands taking to the streets of Berlin and other cities across the country earlier this year to protest the delivery of weapons to Ukraine.",world,0.0

Jerusalem is in front of our eyes, and what is happening there is not separate from Gaza.”It called the operation “Revenge of the Free.”Explosions could be heard in Jerusalem amid the persistent cross-border fire that has led to heavy bloodshed in the region, particularly along the strip.Talks to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Islamic Jihad in Gaza are “on ice right now,” a diplomatic source familiar with the negotiations told CNN Friday. The source asked not to be named discussing closed-door diplomatic talks.On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it launched another round of strikes overnight on the Gaza Strip, hitting what it said were two command centers belonging to senior Islamic Jihad commanders.One command center was used by senior Islamic Jihad operative Muhammad Abu Al Ata for “the planning and command of terrorist activity against Israel,” the IDF said.The second was used by Khaled Azzam, a senior operative in the rocket system in the Gaza division, for “planning launches toward Israeli territory,” according to the IDF.The IDF did not say whether they believed anyone had been killed in the strikes.An Israeli airstrike on Friday also killed two Palestinian men in Gaza – including a Islamic Jihad senior commander – and wounded five others, bringing the number of Palestinian men, women and children killed in Gaza to at least 33 since Tuesday, when Israel’s “Shield and Arrow” operation began.A CNN producer who arrived at the scene shortly after the airstrike saw several windows blown out on the top story of an apartment building.The Israel Defense Forces said that IDF fighter jets also struck four military posts belonging to Islamic Jihad. IDF aircraft also struck a mortar shell launcher in the southern Gaza Strip.Sirens sounded in Israel throughout the day on Friday, warning of incoming rocket fire in areas around Gaza.A CNN team in Sderot, southern Israel, saw Israeli air defenses intercept approximately eight to 10 incoming rockets from Gaza, and had to take shelter briefly from falling shrapnel.The IDF began unleashing waves of airstrikes on Tuesday on what it says are Islamic Jihad operatives and infrastructure along the strip. The IDF has struck 254 targets in Gaza during the operation, which it calls “Shield and Arrow.”Palestinian militant groups have retaliated by launching hundreds of rockets towards Israel.Among the three Palestinian deaths announced on Friday, one was a Palestinian man who died of his injuries in Gaza after being wounded in an airstrike Thursday in the town of Jabaliya, according to his family, according to the Ministry of Health there.The hospital where he died named him as Alian Abu Wadi, 38, and said he died after doctors attempted to save him.Two others were killed in an airstrike on Friday: One has not been named publicly and the other is Islamic Jihad senior commander Iyad Al-Abd Al-Hassan, known as Abu Anas – a member of the Military Council and in charge of the Al Quds Brigades’ Operations Unit, the militant group said Friday.The Israel Defense Forces said he was the target of the attack.Al-Hassan “was a key figure in the organization and was involved in all decisions regarding rocket launches and barrages toward Israel,” the IDF said, adding that his predecessor had been killed on Tuesday.Reflecting on the hostilities’ overall death toll, IDF chief spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the Israeli military believed that 16 Palestinians killed in the violence were “combatants,” and 14 were “uninvolved.”The IDF also said that four of those Palestinians were killed by Islamic Jihad rockets falling short and landing in Gaza, which the militants rejected as a lie.Some 973 rockets have been launched towards Israel in the past three days, as of 4 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) Friday, the IDF said. Of those, 761 crossed into Israel and 212 fell short in Gaza or landed in the Mediterranean sea.Israel’s Iron Dome air defenses intercepted 296 rockets, the IDF said. The system only activates when it projects that a rocket is on target to hit a populated area in Israel.Authorities in Gaza have also outlined the extensive damage caused by Israeli airstrikes and border closures inside the extremely isolated enclave, beyond the deaths and injuries.At least nine civilian houses and 28 housing units have been demolished, and 532 additional housing units were damaged, 37 of which are uninhabitable, authorities said in a government briefing on Friday. In all, 90 families have lost their homes, they added.They warned that Gaza would be forced to shut its electricity plant within 72 hours because they cannot import fuel, adding that one of three turbines at the power station was already shut down.Additionally, all formal schooling in Gaza has been halted.Fishing has been stopped for four days, leaving 3,500 fishermen without work. More than 600 tons of agricultural products are stuck in Gaza, unable to be exported.Gaza is one of the most densely packed places in the world, an isolated coastal enclave of almost 2 million people crammed into 140 square miles.Governed by Hamas, the territory is largely cut off from the rest of the world by an Israeli blockade of Gaza’s land, air and sea dating back to 2007.

712,736,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/europe/afp-journalist-arman-soldin-killed-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html,‘Brave and tenacious’ AFP journalist Arman Soldin killed in rocket fire in eastern Ukraine,2023-05-10 00:56:00,"A French journalist working for the international news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) was killed by rocket fire near the embattled city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday.Arman Soldin, 32, was AFP’s video coordinator in Ukraine and was killed in a rocket attack on the outskirts of the town of Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut, AFP announced on Twitter, citing colleagues who witnessed the incident.“We are devastated to learn of the death of AFP video journalist Arman Soldin in eastern Ukraine today,” AFP said. “All of our thoughts go out to his family and loved ones.”Soldin was with four colleagues at the time of the attack, but the other journalists were not injured, the news agency said.Their reporting team was with Ukrainian soldiers when they came under fire around 4:30pm local time on Tuesday, according to AFP.Soldin, a French citizen with Bosnian origins, was an experienced reporter who had regularly traveled to the front lines, the news agency said. He had been AFP’s video coordinator there since September 2022 and covered the conflict from the early days of Russia’s invasion.“Our journalists travel regularly to this area to report on clashes in the region, the epicenter of fighting in Ukraine for several months,” AFP said in its statement.Soldin is one of the several known journalists killed since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, including Fox News photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and consultant Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova, journalist and documentarian Brent Renaud, and photojournalist Maks Levin.Born in Sarajevo, Arman was evacuated to France in 1992 as the Bosnian war broke out, and he told AFP in an interview last year that “stories about refugees affect me,” according to the agency’s obituary.He joined AFP in 2015 in Rome and his first staff posting was in London later that year, according to the news agency.Following news of his death, there was an outpouring of grief and condolences from his friends and colleagues.“The whole agency is devastated by the loss of Arman,” said Fabrice Fries, CEO of AFP, according to the news agency. “His death is a terrible reminder of the risks and dangers faced by journalists on a daily basis when covering the conflict in Ukraine.”Earlier this month Soldin kept his video camera rolling as he and his team of journalists came under rocket fire near the front line.“Being caught under a rain of Grad yesterday with a bunch of trench-diggers is probably one of the worst things that I’ve experienced since being in Ukraine, with rockets exploding less than 50 meters away,” he wrote. “Pure terror.”Colleagues who had worked with Soldin in Ukraine described him as a “brave and tenacious journalist” and “full of enthusiasm for life” in comments posted on Twitter.One video posted in tribute showed him laughing and singing the 80s pop song “Forever Young” while driving with colleagues in April 2022.In one of Soldin’s last Twitter threads, he posted a series of videos about rescuing a baby hedgehog that the team had found at the bottom of a crater from Russian shelling in Chasiv Yar. Soldin took the hedgehog back to base and hand-fed it back to health.“Arman was the kind of guy who saved hurt hedgehogs in war zones. He was an incredible and vibrant personality and a great journalist. We miss him. We are mourning him. Rest in peace,” said Jonathan Brown, AFP’s deputy news editor for Moscow and Kyiv, on Twitter.French President Emmanuel Macron mourned Soldin’s death, saying on Twitter: “We share the pain of his family and all his colleagues.”“With courage, from the first hours of the conflict he was at the front to establish the facts. To inform us. We share the pain of his loved ones and all his colleagues.”Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya called Soldin a “remarkable journalist” who “paid with his life for his courage.”“My condolences to his loved ones. Respect for all those who take enormous risks to speak the truth about the horrors of war in Ukraine,” he said.In their obituary, AFP wrote that Soldin celebrated his 32nd birthday on March 21 from Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine.“A decent bottle had been opened for the occasion and a colleague had got his guitar out,” AFP quoted his colleague Antoine Lambroschini as saying.“Arman had a delighted little smile on his face.”",world,0.0
713,737,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/europe/russia-victory-day-parade-moscow-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html,"Putin tried to project strength, but Moscow Victory Day parade revealed only his isolation",2023-05-09 17:23:00,"For Russian President Vladimir Putin, this year’s Victory Day parade in Red Square was a chance to continue his war on history. He succeeded only in underscoring his geopolitical isolation.In a speech before the assembled troops, Putin drew a direct line between his invasion of Ukraine and the sacrifices of World War II. Flanked by surviving veterans of what Russia still calls the Great Patriotic War, the Russian president cast himself as savior and defender of an embattled Russia targeted by the “globalist elites” of the West.“Today, civilization again is at a breaking point,” Putin said. “Again, a true war has been unleashed against our motherland.”While Russia sees “no unfriendly nations in the West or in the East,” Putin suggested darker forces are conspiring against Moscow.“Western globalist elites still talk about their exceptionalism, pitting people against each other and splitting society, provoking bloody conflicts and coups, sowing hatred, Russophobia, [and] aggressive nationalism,” he said. “The Ukrainian nation has become hostage to a coup which led to a criminal regime led by its Western masters. It has become a pawn to their cruel and selfish plans.”It’s worth unpacking this for a moment. It’s Putin’s longstanding view that Ukraine is not a legitimate nation — Ukrainians and Russians, in his view, are “one people” and the Ukrainian state is an artificial construct. In his conspiratorial view of the world, states like Ukraine are merely vassals, and Washington calls the shots. And if a shadowy global cabal is pulling the strings in Kyiv, that belief justifies what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.Let’s remember that it was a genuine popular revolt — not, say, the CIA or George Soros — that brought people onto Kyiv’s Maidan Square to support Ukraine’s aspirations for joining the European Union, leading to the ouster of Ukraine’s pro-Russian president in 2014. And that Russian-speaking Ukrainians — and even some Russian nationals — are also fighting and dying on the side of Ukraine.But Putin is immune from fact-checking exercises here. Collective remembrance of World War II is the closest thing Russia has to a state religion, and May 9 — when Russians commemorate the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 — marks the holiest of days. For a domestic audience, the Victory Day parade provides a visual parallel between the veterans of the war that ended 78 years ago and the participants of Russia’s war on Ukraine today.According to state media, over 500 participants of Russia’s so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine took part in the parade on Red Square Tuesday. And in his speech, Putin cast them as the heirs of victory in the Great Patriotic War. Not surprisingly, Ukrainians are pushing back against such historical gaslighting.In video remarks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had submitted a bill to the Verkhovna Rada — Ukraine’s parliament to change official victory day celebrations from May 9 to May 8, and compared Russia’s aggression to that of Hitler’s Germany.“It is on May 8 that most nations of the world remember the greatness of the victory over the Nazis,” Zelensky said. “We will not allow the joint victory of the nations of the anti-Hitler coalition to be appropriated and we will not allow lies as if the victory could have taken place without the participation of any country or nation.”Zelensky also played host to an important visitor in Kyiv on the same day as Putin’s Victory Day parade: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who arrived bearing promises of continued support from Europe for Ukraine.“Ukraine is on the front line of the defense of everything we Europeans cherish: our liberty, our democracy, our freedom of thought and speech,” von der Leyen said. “Courageously Ukraine is fighting for the ideals of Europe that we celebrate today. In Russia, Putin and his regime have destroyed these values. And now they are attempting to destroy them here in Ukraine because they are afraid of the success you represent and the example you show, and they are afraid of your path to the European Union.”And in his joint press conference with von der Leyen, Zelensky was able to rain a little on Putin’s Victory Day parade, noting Russia’s costly and incremental progress on the battlefield.“They [the Russians] were not able to capture Bakhmut,” he said, referring to the embattled and extensively damaged eastern Ukrainian city. “This was the last important military operation that they wanted to complete by the ninth of May. And unfortunately, the city does not exist anymore. Everything is fully destroyed. … So, they need some information to present it as a victory they need to conquer something — some city — [but] they have not managed to do that.”The annual Victory Day celebrations in Russia are supposed to be grand public spectacle married with an advertisement for state power. This year’s parade showcased some of Russia’s military might — featuring its S-400 air defense system and Yars intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, part of Moscow’s nuclear arsenal — but a massive procession of modern tanks, the pride of Russia’s army, was conspicuously absent.And von der Leyen’s visit to Kyiv highlighted Putin’s isolation from Europe and the West. Among the most high-profile visitors featured at Putin’s Victory Day celebrations were an EU-sanctioned president (Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus), a Central Asian strongman (Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan) and the dynastic leader of a petro-state (Serdar Berdymukhamedov of Turkmenistan).On the battlefields of Ukraine, the setbacks being dealt to Russian forces in the meat grinder of Bakhmut could not be a sharper contrast to the pomp and circumstance on Red Square.That fact was brought home by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian mercenary outfit Wagner, who railed on social media against Russia’s military leadership.“Today they [Ukrainians] are tearing up the flanks in the Artemovsk [the Russian name for Bakhmut] direction, regrouping at Zaporizhzhia.

Later various growers told authorities they also detected illegal use of water, Spanish police said.The 44 people under investigation include those who sell and install irrigation pipes and equipment, and pumps to bring water out from wells.The police said that prosecutors in Malaga specialized in environmental offenses were involved, along with an investigating magistrate at a court in the city of Velez Malaga.The 26 people arrested have been arraigned before the magistrate there in recent months and released, with charges pending, the Malaga Civil Guard press office told CNN.The police said the investigation includes alleged crimes against natural resources and the environment and fraudulent use of water.",world,0.0

Among those were six anti-monarchy protesters, who have since been released and will face no further action, police said.In a statement released Monday, the force did not apologize for the arrests but said it regretted the fact that activists were unable to join the planned protest because of the detentions.Graham Smith, head of Republic, was among the six people arrested on Saturday. He said three Met Police officers visited his home on Monday to apologize and return the items that were confiscated from him during the arrest.“They apologised while wearing a body cam. I made it clear the apology is not accepted as we will be taking further action,” he said on Twitter.The Met said it made the arrests on Saturday based on the new and highly controversial Public Order Act, which came into effect when King Charles III signed it last week. The royal ascent is a formality, but its timing just days before the coronation raised eyebrows.The new law gives police powers to take stronger action against people engaging in peaceful demonstrations. It criminalizes some long standing protest tactics, such as locking on, or physically attaching oneself to things like buildings and roads. It also gives police the power to shut down protests before any disruption even occurs.Writing in the Evening Standard newspaper on Tuesday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said that, by Friday evening, his force had “become extremely concerned by a rapidly developing intelligence picture.”He said the intelligence suggested some protesters were “intent on using rape alarms and loud hailers as part of their protest which would have caused distress to military horses.”Rowley added that the Met had said in advance that “there would be a low tolerance of disruption and zero tolerance of security and safety threats.”In a statement issued late Monday, the Met said the six Republic activists were arrested over concerns that they were “seeking to seriously disrupt the event” after officers found items that “could be used as lock-on devices” in their car.However, police said that the investigation “has been unable to prove intent to use them to lock-on and disrupt the event.”Smith said the group carried luggage straps which were intended to be used to secure their posters. “It was not physically possible to ‘lock on’ with them,” he said on Twitter.Republic also said it spent months working with police liaison officers and meeting senior commanders in order to be able to protest during the coronation. Police said it was “not clear” at the time of the arrest that Smith was engaging with the protest liaison team and that the liaison team was not present during the arrests.“While it is unfortunate that the six people affected by this were unable to join the hundreds of peaceful protestors, I support the officers’ actions in this unique fast-moving operational context,” Rowley said in his Evening Standard opinion piece.The coronation was attended by a large number of VIP guests – including more than 100 heads of states – so security was tight throughout central London. The Met said before the event that the day would mark the largest policing action in decades.London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is responsible for the Met Police’s strategic goals, said Monday that he requested more clarity from the force. “While it’s vital the police are able to keep us safe, it must be balanced with protecting the right to peaceful protest – an integral part of democracy,” he said.",world,0.0
718,742,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/13/middleeast/kilicdaroglu-turkey-elections-makeover-mime-intl/index.html,Erdogan’s rival has gone through a political makeover ahead of the elections,2023-05-13 00:06:00,"Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the main opposition candidate in Turkey’s presidential election, is decidedly calm and mild-mannered in his bid to end the two-decade rule of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Much of his campaign messaging has been delivered from his quintessentially Turkish middle-class home and posted on Twitter, in videos that some observers have called his “kitchen diaries.”Seated, often with tea in an “ince belli”, a Turkish teacup, he lays out his key campaign promises, announces members of his potential coalition, and sometimes just speaks candidly to the people, virtually welcoming the public into his home.Such gestures are in stark contrast to the elitist image he and his party once had. Analysts say the desire to appeal to today’s voters has seen the presidential candidate undergo an image makeover over the years. His messages now target Turkey’s middle class and the downtrodden, the very constituency that Erdogan has always championed.But Erdogan is now seen by his critics as being responsible for the economic turmoil the country is facing, largely due to his inability to control runaway inflation, an issue that polls have said is high on the agenda of voters who go to the ballot box on Sunday. Inflation in the country was at 43% in April, down from its peak of 85% last October.For Erdogan’s opponents, that’s fodder for campaigns against him.Promising to fix Turkey’s faltering economy has been a cornerstone of Kilicdaroglu’s campaign. In a video posted on Twitter on Friday, he stood in the kitchen and held up staples like bread, eggs, and yogurt, reminding viewers how much their price had soared in a year. In a separate four-second clip, he says: “Today, if you are poorer than yesterday, the only reason is Erdogan.”Gulfem Saydan Sanver, a political communication expert who works with several politicians in Kilicdaroglu’s center-left Republican People’s Party (CHP), said the kitchen has become a “symbol” of the candidate, “that he is living in a humble (life), and he is dealing with daily life problems of the ordinary Turkish citizens.”“(He) wanted to show that Erdogan is the one who has forgotten about the problems of the lower income families,” she said.His use of Twitter to reach the electorate may not have been out of choice, however. The majority of mainstream media outlets in the country are controlled by government loyalists, prompting the opposition to lean heavily into social media messaging.When he took control of the CHP in 2010, Kilicdaroglu had an image problem, experts say. His party was staunchly secular and fiercely nationalistic. Today, however, it has unified disparate political players, is trying to court the Kurdish vote and has even welcomed defectors from Erdogan’s Islamist-leaning Ak Party.According to some of those who’ve known him, the career bureaucrat turned politician was seen as elitist and disconnected from the working class as he took control of the party, much as the CHP itself was perceived. Erdogan’s government capitalized on that.“The government used very much the people-versus-elite distinction… in order to discredit the opposition by showing them as part of some kind of power elite,” said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul. That created a “very hard, ossified, negative image that the opposition could not get rid of,” he told CNN.The home videos would have been hard to imagine in the early days of his political career since his natural inclination is to keep his private life to himself, said Mehmet Karli, CHP member and longtime adviser to Kilicdaroglu.“He has come to understand over the course of (his) … political life that private and public are very much intermeshed, especially if one is leading a movement,” he told CNN.But the soft-spoken demeanor portrayed from his home could have downsides.Sanver said the kitchen videos had the potential to come off as too soft for some of the tougher foreign policy issues in Turkey – including ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the United States.Erdogan has been able to leverage personal relationships and has shown effective leadership in one of the world’s most intractable issues. Alongside the United Nations, he managed to broker a deal on grain exports between Ukraine and Russia, helping prevent a global food crisis.“It’s one of the critiques I had,” Sanver, who has met with Kilicdaroglu throughout his campaign, told CNN. “He needs to look strong because Erdogan is also very strong.”Delivering some addresses from his office may have helped establish a more serious persona while showing he’s still a different leader than Erdogan, she said.In a country where ethnic and religious identity often plays a part in the public discourse and is exploited by some politicians, Kilicdaroglu has moved swiftly to deprive his opponents of ammunition.In a video posted on Twitter from his office last month, he declared to the electorate that he belongs to the Alevi sect, a minority faith group from the east of Turkey that has for years complained about persecution in the majority Sunni Muslim country. The video was watched 36 million times.“We will no longer talk about identities; we will talk about achievements,” he said. “We will no longer talk about divisions and differences; we will speak of our commonality and our common dreams. Will you join this campaign for this change?”",world,0.0
719,743,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/middleeast/turkey-general-election-explainer-mime-intl/index.html,Turkey’s upcoming elections could unseat Erdogan. Here’s everything you need to know,2023-05-12 12:54:00,"Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday will have President Recep Tayyip Erdogan facing unprecedented challenges that could end his two-decade rule.Voters will decide the fate of Turkey’s democracy less than three months after a February 6 earthquake killed more than 50,000 people and displaced more than more than 5.9 million across southern Turkey and northern Syria.The elections also take place amid a serious economic crisis and what analysts say is democratic erosion under Erdogan’s government.Analysts predict a record voter turnout this year, and a tight race between Erdogan and the main opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) and presidential nominee for the six-party Nation Alliance bloc.More than 1.8 million voters living abroad already cast their votes on April 17, Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah reported Wednesday, citing the country’s deputy foreign minister.Turkey’s demographics are also expected to play a role. Most of the provinces struck by the February earthquake were strongholds of Erdogan and his AK Party. But Supreme Election Council (YSK) chief Ahmet Yener said last month that at least 1 million voters in quake-stricken zones are expected not to vote this year amid displacement.And even if Kilicdaroglu wins the election, some analysts say Erdogan may not hand over power to his successor without a struggle.Here’s what you need to know about the vote that could become a pivotal moment in Turkey’s modern history:Turkey holds elections every five years. Presidential candidates can be nominated by parties that have passed the 5% voter threshold in the last parliamentary election, or those who have gathered at least 100,000 signatures supporting their nomination.The candidate who receives more than 50% of votes in the first round is elected president, but if no candidate gets a majority vote, the election goes to a second round between the two candidates who received the highest number of votes in the first round.Parliamentary elections take place at the same time as the presidential elections. Turkey follows a system of proportional representation in parliament where the number of seats a party gets in the 600-seat legislature is directly proportional to the votes it wins.Parties must obtain no less than 7% of votes – either on their own or in alliance with other parties – in order to enter parliament.The vote will take place Sunday, with candidates casting their ballots for both elections at the same time. The second presidential ballot, if it takes place, will be held on May 28.Polls open on at 8:00 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) and close at 5 p.m. (10 a.m. ET). Results are expected after 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) local time.The pool for this year’s presidential election narrowed to three candidates on Thursday, when Muharrem Ince pulled out of the race.Apart from Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu, right-wing Ancestral Alliance candidate Sinan Ogan is also running.Centrist Homeland Party leader Ince said he had withdrawn following a “slander campaign” against him. He has faced weeks of lurid allegations on social media in Turkey and the Ankara public prosecutor’s office said Thursday it had opened an investigation into potential blackmail.His party, Homeland, will however remain in the parliamentary race.The 59-year-old ran for president in 2018 but lost against Erdogan. In March this year, he broke away from Kilicdaroglu’s CHP and joined the presidential race. He initially rebuffed calls by his former party to pull out amid concern that he’d take votes away from Erdogan’s rival.Ince did not endorse any of the remaining candidates, and his name will also remain on the ballot. His withdrawal is a potential boost to Kilicdaroglu.A lawmaker representing the CHP since 2002 – the same year that saw Erdogan’s AK Party rise to power – Kilicdaroglu, 74, climbed up the political ladder to become his party’s seventh chairman in 2010.Born in the eastern, Kurdish-majority province of Tunceli, the party leader ran in Turkey’s 2011 general election but lost, coming second to Erdogan and his AK Party.Kilicdaroglu represents the party formed 100 years ago by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founding father of modern Turkey and a die-hard secularist. He stands in stark contrast to Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted party and its conservative base.Despite his secular leanings, however, the opposition candidate and his alliance have vowed to represent all factions of Turkish society, which analysts say was demonstrated in his diverse coalition.Reacting to Ince’s withdrawal from the race, Kilicdaroglu on Friday accused Russia of interfering in the election campaign.“Dear Russian friends, you are behind the montages, conspiracies, deep fake content and tapes that were exposed in this country yesterday,” he said on Twitter. “If you want the continuation of our friendship after May 15, get your hands off the Turkish state. We are still in favor of cooperation and friendship.”The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, rejected the accusation in a briefing, calling those who spread such rumors “liars.”“Russia does not interfere in the internal affairs and electoral processes of other countries,” Peskov said. “We place great value on our bilateral relations with the Turkish side, because the Republic of Turkey has so far taken a very responsible sovereign and well-thought-out position on a whole range of regional and global problems that we are facing.”Turkey, a NATO member that has the alliance’s second-largest army, has strengthened its ties with Russia in recent years. In 2019, it even bought weapons from the country in defiance of the US.Erdogan has raised eyebrows in the West by continuing to maintain close ties with Russia as it continues its Ukraine onslaught, and has caused a headache for NATO’s expansion plans by stalling the membership of Finland and Sweden.When the US Ambassador to Ankara Jeff Flake paid a visit in March to Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan lashed out against him, calling the US diplomat’s visit a “shame,” and warning that Turkey needs to “teach the US a lesson in this election.”Analysts have said that even if Erdogan is ousted in the polls, a foreign policy u-turn for Turkey is not a given. While figures close to the opposition have indicated that if victorious, it would reorient Turkey back to the West, others say core foreign policy issues are likely to remain unchanged.Turkey has, however, also been useful to its Western allies under Erdogan. Last year Ankara helped mediate a landmark grains export deal between Ukraine and Russia, and even provided Ukraine with drones that played a part in countering Russian attacks.High in voters’ list of concerns is the state of the economy and the damage caused by the earthquake. Even before the February disaster, Turkey was struggling with rising prices and a currency crisis that in October saw inflation hit 85%.That impacted the purchasing power of the public and is “fundamentally the reason why Erdogan’s popularity has been eroded,” said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and chairman of Istanbul-based think-tank EDAM. “That is going to be the major handicap for Erdogan,” he said.Voters are also casting their ballots based on whom they see as more capable of managing the fallout from the earthquake, as well as shielding the country from future disasters, analysts say, adding that Erdogan’s popularity had not taken the expected political impact.“There is a debate about which electoral platform provides the right solution to address these vulnerabilities and enhance Turkey’s resilience to these national disasters,” Ulgen said.Apart from the economy and the government’s management of Turkey’s frequent natural disasters, voters are likely concerned with Erdogan’s turn away from democracy – something the opposition has campaigned to reverse.Some analysts say that if Erdogan loses the vote by a small margin, it opens up the possibility for him to contest the results.And if past experience is a gauge, then the president and his AK Party may not take a defeat lying down.During the 2019 Istanbul and Ankara mayoral election, the AK Party lost control of the country’s financial hub and capital, prompting party officials from both cities to reject the results, citing voter irregularities.The CHP’s lead in Istanbul was a particularly narrow one, and eventually led to the Supreme Electoral Council (YSK) ruling in favor of a re-run that the opposition strongly objected to.CHP Istanbul mayor candidate Ekrem Imamoglu then went on to win the election re-run, dealing a blow to Erdogan.Ulgen cast doubt on the YSK’s independence, saying it may give in to potential demands for a recount. The body will be the ultimate arbiter of the race, he said.A 2023 report by Freedom House said that the judges of the YSK, who oversee all voting procedures, “are appointed by AKP-dominated judicial bodies and often defer to the AKP in their decisions.” The AK Party’s “institutional dominance” in the media and other branches of society also “tilts the electoral playing field” in Erdogan’s favor, the Washington DC-based advocacy group said.",world,0.0
732,756,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/asia/cancel-culture-law-singapore-intl-hnk/index.html,A law that cancels cancel culture? This country is considering it,2023-05-12 21:57:00,"Cancel culture, the online trend of calling out people, celebrities, brands and organizations – rightly or wrongly – for perceived social indiscretions or offensive behaviors, has become a polarizing topic of debate.To some, it’s an important means of social justice and holding powerful figures to account. But to others, it’s often “misused and misdirected” and has become a form of mob rule.But one country wants to put an end to the deeply contested online phenomena by introducing what legal experts and observers say would be the world’s first law against cancel culture – raising alarm among rights activists who fear that such legal powers could be used to stifle free speech.Over the past year, Singapore’s government has been “looking at ways to deal with cancel culture,” a spokesperson told CNN – amid what some say is a brewing culture war between gay rights supporters and the religious right following the recent decriminalization of homosexuality in the largely conservative city-state.Authorities said they were “examining existing related laws and legislation” after receiving “feedback” from conservative Christians who expressed fears about being canceled for their views by vocal groups online.“People ought to be free to express their views without fear of being attacked on both sides,” law minister K Shanmugam said in an interview with state media outlets in August.“We should not allow a culture where people of religion are ostracized (or) attacked for espousing their views or their disagreements with LGBT viewpoints – and vice versa,” he added.His comments came ahead of the historic repealing of a colonial-era law that criminalized gay sex – even if it was consensual.“We cannot sit by and do nothing. We have to look at the right boundaries between hate speech and free speech in this context,” Shanmugam said. “There could be wider repercussions for society at large where public discourse becomes impoverished… so we plan to do something about this.”In a statement to CNN, his law ministry said the impact of online cancel campaigns could be “far reaching and severe for victims.”“(Some) have been unable to engage in reasonable public discourse for fear of being attacked for their views online… and may engage in self censorship for fear of being made a target of cancel campaigns,” a ministry spokesperson said.The first thing any law tackling cancel culture must do, would be to define the act of canceling – an extremely complex challenge according to legal experts, given how contentious cancel culture can be.The phrase first originated from the slang term “cancel,” referring to breaking up with someone, according to the Pew Research Center, and later gained traction on social media. The Center published a study around the cancel phenomenon in 2021 which revealed deep public division across demographic groups in the United States – from the very meaning of the phrase as well as what cancel culture represents.According to Eugene Tan, an associate law professor from the Singapore Management University (SMU), there remains “no accepted definition” of canceling and as such, any proposed law would have to be “very clearly defined and worded.”“What does it mean when a person claims to be canceled? How would alleged victims show proof of being canceled?” said Tan, who once served as a nominated member of the Singapore Parliament.“All too often, incidents are interpreted, described or remembered by people in different ways. The lack of precision could result in the law being over inclusive, covering acts which it shouldn’t,” added Tan. “But if the definition is limiting, the law could be under inclusive and not cover crucial acts when it should,” said Tan.Given how most cancel cases take place online, the new law would also have to be specially drafted with the internet in mind and likely involve cooperation from social media giants, lawyers in Singapore told CNN.“A cancel law will have to involve the platforms on which people typically discuss or propagate anything related to cancellation and where materials are published,” said Ian Ernst Chai, a lawyer who once served as a deputy public prosecutor in Singapore’s Attorney General’s Chambers.Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok could possibly be asked to police users or comply with court orders to a certain extent, Chai said – and this could also include taking down posts and tweets deemed to be “in infringement of the law.”Special legal mechanisms would also be needed to identify perpetrators (‘cancelers’), said other legal experts. “With cancel culture, things can spread immediately online and people’s reputations can be ruined in a matter of hours,” said criminal lawyer Joshua Tong.“It is clear that traditional legal processes are not suitable for cancel scenarios and a different process must be used. The (new) law could contain sections like intervention mechanisms to stop cancel campaigns before they gather steam,” added Tong.In Singapore’s case, there are also already several laws governing the internet which include an anti fake news bill – punishable with fines of up to 50,000 Singapore dollars ($38,000) or possible prison sentences of up to five years – as well as laws governing cyberbullying and doxing.So a cancel law would have to be one that’s very distinct in nature.The drafting of new laws could take months or even years and would have to be passed in Parliament, Singapore legal experts said.While the government did not provide further details when asked about what a new law dealing with cancel culture would look like or when it could be expected – critics have raised concerns over what they say could result in further restrictions on freedom of speech and expression in Singapore.“It sounds like yet another intimidation tactic by the government against those on the ground trying to raise their voices to demand accountability and change,” said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch.“If a person or a group says hateful and discriminatory things against gay and trans people for example, others should be allowed to call them out and rebut what was said – this isn’t ‘cancel culture’, it’s social discourse and any modern, democratic society should be able to handle that without overbearing state interference.”Free speech advocate Roy Ngerng said a law against cancel culture would be “dangerous.”In 2015, Ngerng was sued for defamation by the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong over a critical blog post he had written about the country’s national pensions plan. Ngerng lost his job at a national hospital as a result and said he was also harassed online.“The government’s strategy has been systematic from the beginning – canceling people like activists, journalists and opposition politicians who they deem disagreeable,” he told CNN.“They have adapted laws for use during the Internet era and perhaps seeing how fast conversations move on social media has prompted them to create a new law to stamp out cancel culture – prevent conversations from moving too quickly,” he said.“We shouldn’t be worried about conversations being canceled – we should be more worried about the government coming up with new laws and ways to cancel Singaporeans.”",world,0.0

Before leaving, he predicted he could be arrested again, despite a court order barring authorities from arresting him on any charges until Monday.“I will again be illegally arrested, this time outside the High Court, I know I will be arrested. My simple message is, how I am I supposed to control what will happen afterwards?” Khan told reporters.He said that his message to followers is to remain peaceful – adding that he won’t be responsible for the reaction of the protesters if he is arrested again.“For 27 years I’ve been in politics… Show me one message which has been different to this…every time I have told my followers, stay within the constitution. When you do protest, be peaceful….We have never broken the law, even now when I tell them to protest, I say they should be peaceful protests. I have always said that,” Khan said.Jubilant supporters gathered outside Khan’s house as he returned home to Lahore early Saturday. Video showed people cheering and throwing flower petals onto Khan’s car as it drove through the crowd, and supporters setting off fireworks.The ex-leader was granted the two-week temporary release on bail on Friday, one day after Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled Khan’s arrest last week by Pakistan’s anti-graft agency, the National Accountability Bureau, was unlawful.Khan’s party had filed a petition to challenge the illegal land acquisition charges against him.Soon after his arrest, Khan accused the country’s powerful army chief: “There is only one man taking action against me and that is the army chief,” Khan told reporters in court on Friday, referring to army chief General Syed Asim Munir.CNN has approached Pakistan’s military for comment.Khan also said that arrest warrants had been issued for his wife. “I am 100% sure I will be arrested again. I was allowed by the NAB to talk to my wife, arrest warrants are issued against her too,” Khan  told CNN outside the courtroom ahead of his hearing.Gunshots could be heard outside near the court early Saturday. Police say they have made two arrests and are investigating what happened.Khan was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last year and has since led a popular campaign against the current government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accusing it of colluding with senior military leaders to remove him from office and keep him locked out of politics.He has also made allegations the government worked with the United States in a conspiracy to remove him from office, claims both parties rejected.The army has previously rejected Khan’s claims it had anything to do with past purported attempts on his life.Unprecedented scenes emerged following Khan’s arrest of defiant crowds breaking into military properties and setting the homes of army personnel ablaze, directly challenging a usually untouchable force that has long sat at the apex of power in Pakistan.The government has blocked mobile internet services in a bid to quell the chaos, disrupting access to social media like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube as well as key delivery apps and even digital payment platforms.At least eight people have died and hundreds have been arrested nationwide, according to officials.Police have also arrested several senior leaders of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party for “inciting arson and violent protests.”The crisis comes as the nation of 220 million people grapples with an acute economic crisis, as soaring inflation leaves people unable to afford food and fuel, heightening fears about the country’s stability in what is an election year for Pakistan.",world,0.0
736,760,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/asian-american-fusion-food-korean-bbq-viet-cajun-cec/index.html,These Asian fusion cuisines tell an American story,2023-05-13 12:35:00,"The US has often been described as a “melting pot” – and though some now consider the metaphor outdated, it still holds true when it comes to food. Immigrants from around the world have for centuries adapted their traditional dishes to incorporate native ingredients or to accommodate other tastes on US soil.One of the most popular remixes is the category of Asian fusion. These intercultural collaborations tell a unique story, from adapting a plate of chow mein for European palates in the early 20th century to combining Korean barbecue with Mexican tacos nearly 100 years later. Each of these creations marks a distinct era in US immigration – while some are fading, others are now taking off. Here’s a look at how some of them came about.The Kogi BBQ taco truck isn’t simply fusion, as chef Roy Choi describes it. It is a “psychedelic intersection” of cultures found in the specific 3-mile radius of Los Angeles’ Koreatown, making it distinctly “Los Angeles food” for, and by, American children of immigrants.Choi told CNN his food is an amalgamation of traditional flavors found in this region, including culinary traditions from Korea, Central America, certain parts of Mexico and Bangladesh. He remembers aunties and mothers of neighbors and friends, cooking and selling their food on street corners.He said the Kogi BBQ truck “channeled all the history and ancestry of street food – the loncheras and the taqueiros – we came from that culture.”Choi said the Kogi short rib taco was inspired by a drunken night outside a club eating tacos when his business partner wondered if he could put Korean barbecue in the tortilla instead of carne asada. Today, customers will find their short rib taco topped with cilantro, onion, lime and a relish salad that’s reminiscent of an appetizer served before Korean barbecue meals. Choi also makes a hybrid salsa verde using Korean chiles, dried Mexican chiles and California produce.Choi said his food speaks to a generation of children who were not raised in their “mother” countries.“We grew up hopscotching between two different cultures and languages. But we still got to figure out how to be American. And that whole kind of divide and purgatory, between identity, is what our food is,” Choi said.Whether he’s making slippery shrimp, shaking beef or kogi tacos, Choi said his food is a mutation of original dishes that do not look like the names they are given. Over time, this evolution turns into its own type of food, he said, in the same way the Hawaiian plate has become its own cuisine, or the way Italian American food was established.For now, Choi said this is a new culture that we’re witnessing: “When people (got) into this taco, it felt for the first time, like L.A. had all come together in one bite.”Chef Nini Nguyen said Viet-Cajun food arrived when a large group of Vietnamese refugees came to Louisiana after the Vietnam War, but this phenomenon didn’t truly take off until after Hurricane Katrina. These major events shook up entire communities, transforming the way they eat.After the Vietnam War, Nguyen’s parents ended up in New Orleans, where many Vietnamese refugees were largely housed together, sponsored by the Catholic Church.New Orleans seemed immediately familiar to this new immigrant community. The city had also experienced French colonialism. Its people were used to a hot and humid climate, they were familiar with the seafood industry, they also drank coffee with milk, they had their own version of beignets, and their po’ boy bread was similar to Vietnam’s banh mi bread.“I only eat po’ boys with Vietnamese bread,” Nguyen said. The light, airy, crumbly texture of Vietnamese bread comes from baking the dough the same day that it’s made, she said, rather than letting it ferment the way denser, French baguettes are made. Nguyen said that texture and taste are more suited to hot and humid weather.But Nguyen points out that for decades, her family and other Vietnamese immigrants learned to make authentic local Creole cuisine, carefully following traditional methods and ingredients. And while she saw a Vietnamese-owned corner store adapt local recipes by adding a little Vietnamese fish sauce or chicken bouillon powder, the adjustments were far from extreme.“It is a delicate place,” she said. “We… for a long time, felt like we needed to accommodate to their palate, because this is what they want. This is how they like it. And this is, you know, being respectful to that cuisine at the same time.”But when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, many New Orleanians migrated to Houston, where Nguyen said they felt free to try culinary experimentation.Soon, crawfish boils came with buttery, aromatic sauces full of garlic, lemongrass, Thai basil and tamarind powder. Banh mi po’ boys were filled with dripping, saucy, fried shrimp with pickles, cucumber and cilantro. Meanwhile, Vietnamese coffee in the US had become synonymous with New Orleans’ Café du Monde, with the café’s iconic orange-yellow tin cans holding bunches of chopsticks in Vietnamese restaurants.While New Orleans city cuisine is more Creole, Nguyen said rural Louisiana cuisine is considered Cajun.“We just call it Viet Cajun, but it’s really Louisiana food,” Nguyen said of this Vietnamese-influenced cuisine. “We’re finally in a place where one – we feel like we can do these things, which I think is very beautiful, and two – that people want to eat these kinds of things. And so, I think it’s a very exciting time for Vietnamese people to be able to be themselves, wherever they are.”As some people have migrated back from Texas to Louisiana, “Viet Cajun” food has become more popular. Nguyen is creating a cookbook, where she’ll throw in her own fusion recipes, including blackened catfish with curry and lemongrass seasonings.Jose Tso made it clear: he doesn’t feel Chinese-Cuban cuisine is “fusion.” Tso said it simply means cooking and serving Spanish-style dishes, alongside Cantonese-style Chinese food, side by side.“They just complement each other. For example, like Spanish cooking is a lot of times heavily seasoned. And concentrated on broiled, grilled or fried. And Cantonese-style Chinese food is not that much fried, but sauteed and cooked or steamed with water in the wok. So, if you have an oily mouth, and you have some nicely freshly cooked, hot, but not greasy Chinese vegetables, it just complements each other,” Tso said.Tso and his nephews are the current generation of owners of the Flor de Mayo restaurant, which has three locations in New York City. The name, Tso said, is the Spanish translation of “Mayflower,” to represent the spirit of pilgrims who came by sea, looking for a better future.Tso said Phillip Chu and William Cho, the founders of the first Flor de Mayo restaurant, came to New York from Guangzhou (previously Canton) via Peru. When they arrived in the US in the late ’60s and early ‘70s, there was already a bustling industry of several hundred Chinese-Latin restaurants, run by Chinese immigrants who had first immigrated to Cuba, but then fled to the US in the 1950s during the Cuban Revolution.Chu and Cho worked for several of these restaurants, ultimately working at one called Asia Star. When the owner retired, they took over and transformed it into Flor de Mayo.Today, Tso said Flor de Mayo still makes Cuban dishes, including steak tenderloin with sauteed onions, ground or chopped beef in sauce, sauteed beef, chicken liver, rice and beans, plantains and avocados. At one location, they added Peruvian rotisserie chicken. The Chinese food serve includes steamed vegetables, pork chop, fried rice, spare ribs, wontons and lo mein.While the Spanish-style cuisine requires more pre-seasoning before food is fried, the Chinese food is typically seasoned while being sauteed in a wok. Over time, Flor de Mayo has excelled in preparing the two cuisines in one kitchen.“Our Spanish food and our Chinese food is interchangeable in the way of how to cook it… Some Spanish dishes we can also cook in the wok,” Tso said.But the tradition is fading, as the largest waves of Chinese immigrants who came to the US via South and Central America arrived mainly in the 20th century. Tso said those who still come through that route today have more education, with more opportunities for higher-skilled jobs.Doing the difficult work of running a restaurant “will give you stability like a steady income, but it won’t make you rich. And in order to achieve this so-called steady income, you spend a lot of time…nowadays, the next generation do not want this kind of lifestyle,” Tso said.By Tso’s estimates, there are currently fewer than 10 Chinese-Latin restaurants left in Manhattan.Regina Mark’s Mee Sum restaurant is not where the chow mein sandwich was invented, but it is one of the modern bastions of this odd tradition that has captured the attention of foodie Instagrammers while serving as a reminder of the industry Fall River, Massachusetts, once had.Mark’s in-laws’ family emigrated from Canton, now known as Guangzhou, in the first half of the 20th century. She said they came by way of Arkansas and Rhode Island to Fall River, which was then a buzzing textile town with European immigrants working in factories and mills.Mark said Europeans were used to having garlic bread with their spaghetti and wanted bread with each meal. Local Chinese restaurants were already serving chow mein with a few slices of bread, so a person could soak up the brown gravy and push around the noodles.“And then one day, this restaurant, they ran out of the sliced bread. The owner says, ‘the only thing I have is the hamburger bun. Would you mind?’ So, he gave them a couple of buns to take home, and… the customer liked it. He said ‘hey, you know I made a chow mein sandwich out of it, and you should start that,’” Mark said.Today, one can order this dish on a plate, where brown gravy-covered crispy noodles flow with reckless abandon between two halves of a hamburger bun. Or, if ordered via takeout, it can be eaten by hand like a burger out of wax paper, and when slightly cooled, the brown gravy congeals and helps the noodles and buns maintain structure.In the 1940s, Mark said Mark Restaurant sat on the second floor above a movie theater in downtown Fall River, where cinemagoers could go upstairs after a movie and get a chow mein sandwich, soda and dessert for 50 cents. The restaurant also sold fish and chips, fries, and coleslaw. But “teaching” people how to eat fried rice and egg rolls was a challenge.“One week, at that time, we sell maybe a dozen egg rolls. When my in-laws started it on the menu, people don’t even know what it is. What is it? And they started learning how to eat it. And now we sell hundreds and hundreds,” Mark said.The original Mark Restaurant is now gone, but her in-laws had also opened Mee Sum Restaurant in 1950, which is now run by the next generation of Marks. Their chow mein sandwich and their fried rice carries a darker color than the way other Chinese restaurants make it, Mark said. That’s because she adds a caramel coloring to evoke the feeling of a richer, beef dish.“People eat with their eyes before they taste it. If they don’t care for (the appearance), they don’t want to eat it,” she said. “Food always brings people happiness. You can, no matter what time it is, you entertain people with food.”Mark reflected on the rough life the first generation of Marks experienced, arriving in the US by boat, establishing themselves in a town where other Asian immigrant families were initially hostile toward new restaurant competition, and having barely enough money to heat their home.Today, her family’s restaurant thrives as a key part of the Fall River community. She’s not sure that there’s anyone in the younger generation willing to take over the business. But for now, she and her family continue to feed and entertain New Englanders and visitors who come from afar to try their chow mein sandwich.",travel,0.0
737,761,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/where-to-travel-best-destinations-2023/index.html,Where to travel in 2023: The best destinations to visit,2023-05-13 06:13:00,"As peak vacation season sails into view and the world shakes off the last shackles of the pandemic, it feels like the appetite for hitting the road has never been greater.International tourism reached 80% of pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2023, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, with an estimated 235 million tourists traveling internationally in January, February and March. And experts are cautiously optimistic about a continued travel rebound.Demand is high, with many popular destinations booking out earlier in the year.Thankfully, there’s so much out there still to see and do.Here are 23 destination ideas from CNN Travel to get you started:We could list new openings in Poland – such as Hotel Verte, the new Autograph Collection property in Warsaw, which threw open its gilded doors (it’s in a humongous Baroque palace) last August. But the reason you should visit Poland in 2023 isn’t for the chance to stay in a place fit for royalty. It’s to show solidarity with a country which has, in turn, shown solidarity to the people of Ukraine.Sharing a 300-plus-mile border with a country under attack has meant that Poland has taken in more Ukrainian refugees than anywhere else. Add to that plummeting tourist numbers (though they’re on the rise again), and you have a tricky situation.So whether you fancy that Warsaw palace, a city break to the likes of Krakow, Gdansk, Wrocław or Poznań – all hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border – or to get away from it all in the forests, lakes and mountains of the countryside – now’s your chance to do some good by taking a vacation. – Julia BuckleyBack in April, thousands of people descended on the town of Exmouth and the greater Ningaloo Peninsula, to witness a rare total solar eclipse as it became visible over the northwestern edge of Australia.Organizers spent more than a year planning for the event, which lasted about a minute, and featured musical performances, educational opportunities to learn about science and astronomy, and a three-day festival.But the state of Western Australia offers much more than some 60 seconds of wonder.Spanning one-third of the entire continent of Australia, it stretches from the lively, growing state capital of Perth across deserts including the Great Victoria and Great Sandy to the wine country of Margaret River, the dramatic clifftops of the Kimberley and the quokka-covered Rottnest Island. – Lilit MarcusEngland’s port city of Liverpool, best known around the world as the birthplace of The Beatles, has added another chapter to its musical legacy.It’s the host city of Eurovision 2023, the spangly extravaganza of song that brings an influx of thousands of flag-waving fans from across the continent. The annual event is an opportunity for the city to bounce back after the ignominy of being stripped of its UNESCO World Heritage status in 2021.In June, the city will celebrate 25 years of the Liverpool Biennial contemporary visual arts festival, as more than 30 international artists and collectives take over spaces in the city until September.England is also marking the Year of the Coast in 2023, with food festivals and beach cleans taking place along the country’s shores. Just a half hour from Liverpool city center by train, Crosby Beach is the permanent home of sculptor Antony Gormley’s “Another Place,” where 100 cast-iron figures stand facing out to sea. – Maureen O’HareCharleston parades its past like no other US city, but it often glossed over the history of its Black residents. It’s been taking steps to fix that.Enter the much-delayed International African American Museum, which is now expected to open in late June.Located on the shoreline of the Cooper River in the spot where many Africans first set foot in North America, it will explore the lives of slaves and their descendants.Visitors in late May and early June can enjoy the world-renowned Spoleto Festival featuring opera, theater, dance, musical acts and artist talks.In March, foodies headed to the Charleston Wine and Food Festival to sample Lowcountry favorites.For fancy Southern fare, try Magnolias. Opened in 1990, it helped spur the city’s culinary renaissance. For something informal, try Bertha’s Kitchen in North Charleston, where red rice with sausage, fried chicken and lima beans rule. The eatery even caught attention of “Roadfood” author Michael Stern. – Forrest BrownSelf-effacing Vilnius admitted in an ad campaign this year that nobody really knows where it is. If their brilliant video didn’t make you want to book a trip there immediately, perhaps this will: the capital of Lithuania celebrated its 700th anniversary on January 25, 2023.To mark the milestone, a packed program of events, including music festivals and exhibitions, are being held throughout the year. But use the anniversary as a push to visit rather than following a program religiously.The entire city center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site – putting it up there with its fellow V-cities, Venice and Vienna. Vilnius makes it on the list thanks to its Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque buildings, all sitting on a medieval street plan, but it’s best known for its Baroque architecture.Don’t miss the frothy bell tower of St. John’s church (you can climb it for sweeping city views) or the church of St. Casimir, topped by a giant crown. Got an eye for social media? This is Europe’s only capital city that allows hot air balloons to cruise over the city skyline. – JBBrilliant blue waters, expansive coral reefs and hundreds of peaceful islands: Fiji is not a hard sell. But why go there in 2023? For one, the country only reopened post-Covid at the end of 2021, meaning that visitor numbers to the South Pacific paradise have yet to fully rebound.While the country is spoiled for underwater beauty, take an opportunity to explore its above-ground treasures, too. The country’s lone UNESCO World Heritage site is the town of Levuka, a former capital and an important port, which is studded with British colonial-era buildings amid coconut and mango trees.To learn about the local Indigenous communities, travelers can take part in a kava welcoming ceremony – named for the traditional drink at its center – or enjoy a lovo, a meal cooked by hot coals in an underground pit covered with banana leaves.Fiji Airways now has direct flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it relatively easy to get to the islands. As the Fijians say, bula! – LMAs the fate of the Amazon rainforest hangs in the balance, two eco-lodges around Manaus – the capital of Brazil’s Amazonas state, and gateway to the river – have used their pandemic pause to get even more environmentally friendly.Juma Amazon Lodge, about 50 miles south of the city, is now fully powered by a new $400,000 solar plant, whose 268 double panels swagger nearly 40 feet into the air above the canopy (meaning no trees had to be cut). They’ve also built a biogas system to increase the efficiency of organic waste treatment, reducing annual carbon emissions by eight tons.Meanwhile, Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge, northwest of Manaus on the Rio Negro river, opened an off-grid “advanced base” during the pandemic that’s 30 miles from the main lodge and accessible only via river.Guests can take long jungle hikes through territory home to jaguars, pumas and giant armadillos in what’s one of the Amazon region’s most remote hotel facilities, then spend the afternoon in a hammock or by the pool. For 2023, the lodge is planning overnight stays in a creekside tent for small groups.Don’t miss Manaus itself – eating behemoth Amazonian fish outside the pink 1896 opera house is a bucket list experience. – JBThere’s been no shortage of reasons to visit Greece’s second city in recent times, with a UNESCO-endorsed local food scene that recently celebrated the refurb and reopening of its century-old Modiano food market.Throw in a popular waterfront and proximity to beautiful beaches and inland mountains, Thessaloniki is surely a contender for one of Europe’s best city-break destinations.What could make it even better? How about a gleaming new metro system? All being well, November 2023 should see the opening of the main line of an infrastructure megaproject that will eventually connect the city’s downtown to its international airport. Driverless trains will whisk passengers through tunnels whose excavation has added to Thessaloniki’s already rich catalog of archeological discoveries, many of which will be on display in specially created museum stations.  – Barry NeildJanuary 2023 saw the official opening of Rwanda’s most exciting hotel yet: Sextantio Rwanda, a collection of traditionally crafted huts on an island on Lake Kivu, one of Africa’s largest lakes.It’s the first project outside Italy for Daniele Kihlgren, whose part-hotel, part-living history projects keep local tradition alive. A nonprofit delivering money straight to local communities, Sextantio sees guests fishing on the 1,000-square-mile lake, paddling in dug-out canoes, trying local banana beer and wildlife-spotting – and not just the chickens, cows, pigs and goats that roam around the property.Of course, you’ll want to see gorillas. Adjoining Volcanoes National Park, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund opened the 4,500-square meter Ellen DeGeneres Campus in 2022. Its visitor center includes exhibits, virtual reality gorilla “encounters” and nature trails.Over in Akagera National Park, white rhinos – transferred from South Africa in 2021 to aid conservation – are already calving. It’s easier to get there, too. A new route from London joins Brussels, Dubai, Guangzhou and Mumbai as the only direct flights to Kigali from outside the African continent. – JBVoted the world’s most sustainable destination in the world for six years running, Sweden’s second-biggest city is finally emerging from the shadow of Stockholm.Once a major trading and shipping town, Gothenburg is now considered to be one of the greenest destinations in Europe, with 274 square meters (2,950 square feet) of green space per citizen, while 95% of its hotels are certified as eco-friendly.Although Gothenburg officially turned 400 in 2021, the celebrations were put on ice because of the global pandemic. But they’re finally taking place in 2023, so it’s a great time to visit.Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustav, who celebrates 50 years on the throne this year, will be in town on June 4, Gothenburg’s official birthday, and the city’s major anniversary festival is being held in the Frihamnen port district from June 2 to 5, with concerts and art events among the activities on offer.The festivities will continue throughout the summer until the September 3 kick off of Göteborgsvarvet Marathon, a new 26-mile race following on from the city’s popular half marathon on May 13. – Tamara Hardingham-GillWhen travelers think of the United Arab Emirates, the dazzling skyline of Dubai is usually what springs to mind.But the UAE has a lot to offer nature lovers too – particularly the northernmost emirate Ras al-Khaimah, which is aiming to become the Middle East’s most sustainable destination by 2025 thanks to a new “Balanced Tourism” strategy.Just 45 minutes from Dubai, it’s often called the “adventure Emirate,” and for good reason. Offering beaches, deserts and mountains, outdoor attractions abound, such as sand boarding, trekking, wakeboarding, skydiving, scuba diving and even the world’s longest zipline.But it’s not all about the adrenaline rush. Ras Al Khaimah is where you’ll find the highest restaurant in the United Arab Emirates, 1484 by Puro, which sits in the emirate’s Jebel Jais Mountains. Culture seekers can head for the historic Dhayah Fort, which dates back to the Late Bronze Age (1600-1300 BC).Where to stay? Luxury hospitality brand Anantara is opening a fabulous new resort there later this year that will offer 174 guestrooms, suites and overwater villas along with specialty restaurants and a spa. – Karla CrippsSharing borders with Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Myanmar, landlocked Laos has long been a must-hit spot for time-rich travelers making their way through the Southeast Asia circuit.But now, thanks to the 2021 opening of a semi-high-speed railway, it’s easier than ever to get around the country at a quicker pace, shaving hours off journeys that previously took full days to travel.You’re still going to have to make some hard choices – there’s a lot to see in Laos.Towering karst peaks await visitors to adventure-haven Vang Vieng, while UNESCO-listed Luang Prabang is filled with French-colonial heritage, Buddhist ritual and natural beauty. (Luxury seekers will want to check into the Rosewood Luang Prabang, with its stylish hilltop tents)The mysterious Plain of Jars, a megalithic archaeological site, can be found in the Xiangkhoang Plateau. For a once-in-a-lifetime experience that makes a difference, head for Bokeo Province and join one of the Gibbon Experience’s overnight treks. Guests of this tourism-based conservation project spend the night in the world’s tallest treehouses – only accessible by zipline –  among wild, black-crested gibbons.  – KCRolling hills, medieval buildings – and the officially crowned world’s best cheese. Welcome to Gruyères, Switzerland.Everywhere you look in this tiny, hilltop town, there’s a different picture-perfect view – from the medieval market square to the turreted 13th-century castle.  A doable day trip from Geneva, summer promises hiking opportunities aplenty, while winter allows for venturing to the nearby Moléson-sur-Gruyères ski resort.To taste Gruyères’ namesake fromage, stop off at the wood-lined Chalet de Gruyères. And to learn how cheesemakers perfect this creamy goodness, head to La Maison du Gruyère factory. For further foodie delights, there’s the Maison Cailler chocolate factory – from the outside it looks like something from a Wes Anderson movie, inside it offers a glimpse into the secrets of Swiss chocolate making.Gruyères is also home to the surreal HR Giger Museum, celebrating the work of the acclaimed Swiss artist behind the eponymous alien in the 1979 movie “Alien.” A drink at the museum’s bar, designed by Giger in an eerie skeletal aesthetic, offers an antidote to Gruyères’ fairytale vibe. – Francesca StreetA modern Indigenous restaurant in Minneapolis has earned one of the culinary world’s highest honors, and it’s not alone in shining light on Native communities in the area.At Owamni, a James Beard Award winner for best new restaurant, Indigenous ingredients – trout, bison, sweet potatoes and more – make up “decolonized” menus where ingredients such as wheat flour and beef are absent. The restaurant is a partnership between chef Sean Sherman, Oglala Lakota and Dana Thompson, who is a lineal descendant of the Wahpeton-Sisseton and Mdewakanton Dakota tribes.Earlier this year, one of the pair’s community-owned initiatives, Indigenous Food Lab, opened a market in Minneapolis’ Midtown Global Market, a former Sears building housing businesses that represent more than 22 cultures.The open-air Four Sisters Farmers Market (Thursdays June through October) also focuses on Indigenous products. And at the Minnesota History Center in neighboring St. Paul, the exhibit “Our Home: Native Minnesota” looks at thousands of years of Native history in the state. – Marnie HunterCaribbean coast destinations such as the Rosario archipelago or the UNESCO heritage list city of Cartagena are rightly top of most Colombia travel wish lists, but also deserving a look-in is the country’s somewhat unsung capital of Bogotá.Yes, it’s a messy, traffic-snarled urban sprawl, but it’s also a high-altitude crucible of culture and cuisine. There are tours that chart the city’s transformation from graffiti wild west to incredible street art gallery.Equally colorful are the restaurants that make the most of Colombia’s diverse natural larder of flora on menus that range from delicious peasant dishes to mind-blowing Michelin-level gastronomy. And then there’s the coffee!The congestion (except on regular cycle-only days) thins quickly on its outskirts, allowing day trips to see historic and modern treasures. Itineraries include Lake Guatavita, where conquistadors once plundered sunken gold offerings left by indigenous Muisca people, or the majestic subterranean Zipaquirá salt cathedral. – BNFamed for its mountain treks through ancient trails that once facilitated trade between the Himalayas and India, Nepal’s stunning Mustang Valley sits on the doorstep of Tibet.Expect to hear a lot more about this remote destination in the coming months thanks to the arrival of the soon-to-open Shinta Mani Mustang. Part of the Bensley Collection, this all-inclusive resort perched above the small town of Jomsom in the Lower Mustang will offer luxury seekers 29 suites inspired by traditional Tibetan homes.In addition to trekking, Mustang visitors can explore ancient villages and Buddhist monasteries. Also not to be missed, the man-made Mustang Caves sit above the Gandaki River and are filled with 2,000-year-old Buddhist sculptures and paintings.Getting to the Mustang Valley is part of the adventure. Travelers will need to take a 25-minute flight from capital Kathmandu to Pokhara then hop on another plane for the 20-minute journey to Jomsom. The views alone might make this option more pleasing to some than the alternative – a 12-hour drive from Kathmandu.  – KCFrom the spectacular wildlife to the beautiful national parks and beaches, Tanzania is absolutely bursting with visual splendor.The East African country holds a seemingly endless list of incredible sights, with Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest mountain, UNESCO world heritage site Serengeti National Park, and the Zanzibar Archipelago, among its many highlights.This year, flag carrier Air Tanzania will launch new routes to West and Central Africa, along with the UK, in a bid to transform the country’s largest airport in Dar es Salaam into a transport and logistics hub, while construction on the country’s first toll expressway is also scheduled to begin.Meanwhile, the Delta Hotels by Marriott brand made its Africa debut with the opening of its Dar es Salaam Oyster Bay property earlier this year.  -- THGCould this finally be the year tourists can see the Grand Egyptian Museum? After delay upon delay, the museum is expecting a 2023 opening.GEM will be the largest museum dedicated to a single civilization, costing around $1 billion and holding the entire King Tut collection. See video here of a CNN insider visit.If you arrive in Cairo before it opens, the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square can still scratch your antiquity itch.While the Pyramids of Giza are the city’s tour-de-force, there’s still more to see. Start with Islamic Cairo. This area has one of the largest collections of historic Islamic architecture in the world. While there, visit the Al-Azhar mosque, which dates back to 970.The city also has a rich Christian tradition. Coptic Cairo, part of Old Cairo, has a concentration of Christian sites that pre-date the arrival of Islam.If you need a respite from Cairo’s cacophony, Al Azhar Park has a nice expanse of greenery and a design inspired by historic Islamic gardens. And the affluent neighborhood of Zamalek, which sits on an island in the Nile River, serves up restaurants, antique stores and swanky hotels. – FBYayoi Kusama has the distinction of being the best-selling living female artist on the planet. In particular, she has become a global icon for her sculptures of giant polka-dotted pumpkins, one of which was reinstalled at the pier of Naoshima, one of Japan’s “art islands,” in 2022 after being swept into the sea the year before.However, Naoshima is so much more than its famous yellow gourd or its works by Kusama.There are five small, walkable “art islands” in the Seto Inland Sea, which is located between the main islands of Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku in southeastern Japan. The largest collection of things to see – not to mention the only hotel – is on Naoshima. Together, the five champion modern and contemporary art, with emphasis on Japanese artists.Don’t come here expecting calligraphy and other classical forms. Instead, be awed by Tadao Ando’s massive stone monoliths, a tiny gallery where patrons can listen to nothing but the beats of human hearts, a makeshift thunderstorm created inside a wooden house and an exhibit where jumping in and taking a bath is intended to be part of the artistic experience. – LMWith direct flights to Belize City from about a dozen North American airports, this Central American country is a low-hassle hop for many travelers during the November to April high season.Most visitors head directly to Belize’s Caribbean coastline. The country’s largest island, Ambergris Caye, sits next to Belize Barrier Reef – the world’s second largest coral reef system. Margaritaville Beach Resort opened on the island in March, and “eco-luxury” resort Alaia Belize opened in 2021.Farther south, the Great Blue Hole – a massive underwater sinkhole – is an aquatic magnet for both scuba divers and aerial photographers.But Belize offers way more than its enticing islands.Lush rainforests, cave networks, winding rivers and rich Mayan archaeological sites invite exploration in a country that’s had an evolving sustainable tourism master plan since 2012. Ruins of the Mayan city of Altun Ha are just about an hour north of Belize City. Or farther west, Lamanai is one of Belize’s largest and most fascinating Mayan sites. – MHMexico is arguably as rich in culinary heritage as it is in Mesoamerican archaeological treasures, and Eva Longoria explores many distinctive flavors in her series “Searching for Mexico,” which aired on CNN this year.The state of Oaxaca, which Longoria visits, has an especially deep well of culinary traditions. Plus, Oaxaca produces most of the world’s mezcal.Tlayudas, known as Oaxacan pizzas, are a street food staple. A large corn tortilla is typically layered with lard, beans, traditional Oaxacan cheese, pork and other toppings such as avocado and tomato. The state is also renowned for its seven mole sauces, with recipes that may call for dozens of ingredients from chiles and sesame seeds to chocolate and dried fruit.In the city of Oaxaca, Mercado Benito Juárez is one of many markets across the state selling items such as dried chiles, fresh produce, handicrafts and crunchy grasshoppers. To sample the state’s increasingly popular beverage, the town of Santiago Matatlán is the place for mezcal distillery tours and tastings. – MHIt doesn’t have Montreal’s French flair or Toronto’s international oomph, so the Canadian capital can get overlooked. That would be a mistake. Graceful and understated, Ottawa has its own draws.Music lovers should take note of two Ottawa Jazz Festivals. The winter edition took place in February, and the summer edition will run from June 23-30.If you love hockey, watch the Ottawa Senators do their NHL thing at the Canadian Tire Centre in the western suburbs. If that ticket is too pricey, check out the Ottawa 67’s, a more affordable option of junior men’s hockey games at downtown’s TD Place Arena.The Rideau Canal turns into the world’s largest skating rink from sometime in January to late February or early March, depending on ice thickness. It’s free and accessible 24/7. When it’s warmer, it’s a great spot for people and boat watching.A don’t-miss is Parliament Hill, home to Canada’s federal government and the visually striking Parliament buildings on a promontory overlooking the Ottawa River. – FBThere’s considerable change brewing in Uganda’s travel offerings at the moment with the East African country looking beyond the traditional staples of safari and wildlife spotting to appeal to both regional and international visitors.Keen to revitalize post-Covid tourism in all corners of the country, not just the big-ticket businesses offering wealthy visitors a glimpse of the Big Five beasts or mountain gorillas, it’s turned to marketing its other attributes.And why not? From the expansive shores of Lake Victoria to the snowy Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda is a beautiful wilderness playground, with opportunities for adventure including treks through the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest or up to the craters of the Virunga volcano chain or whitewater rafting along the Victoria Nile.There’s also an emphasis on connecting visitors with Ugandan communities – promising tastes of Ugandan food, music and culture. Last year saw the launch of the Uganda Cycling Trail, a 1,600-kilometer mainly unpaved 22-stage route designed to appeal to all levels of cyclist from hardcore solo bikepackers to fully-guided easy riders. – BN",world,0.0
738,762,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/travel-news-tuscany-castle-japan-guesthouse/index.html,How to turn a rundown castle into a luxury retreat,2023-05-13 05:46:00,"In travel news this week: a restaurant on the edge of space is now taking bookings, a hypersonic startup promises to fly people from Europe to Australia in under five hours, and couples transform incredible properties in Italy and Japan.A little English island that inspired legendary crime novelist Agatha Christie is up for sale, and it comes with its own Art Deco hotel and helipad. Burgh Island, off the Devon coast, has a 25-room hotel with mermaid pool and billiard room – an ideal spot for Colonel Mustard and the candlestick.Seems like too big a job to take on?

739,763,https://edition.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/travel/chase-sapphire-lounge,Your sneak peek inside the first US Chase Sapphire Lounge at Boston Logan International Airport,2023-05-12 12:25:00,"Boston-based travelers, you’re in for a treat.Chase will open its first US Chase Sapphire Lounge on May 16 at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS). The lounge is the first of its kind in the US, and more are slated to open at New York-LaGuardia (LGA) and Philadelphia (PHL), among other major airports, in the coming years. These US lounges join the likes of the first Chase Sapphire Lounge at Hong Kong International Airport (HKG), which opened in 2022.CNN Underscored got a sneak peek of the Boston lounge, and it’s a welcome addition to Boston’s airport. You’ll find the lounge near Gate B40 in the Terminal B to C connector, so it’s easy to access if you’re flying American Airlines, JetBlue or United Airlines. The lounge covers a huge 11,640 square feet and has all the amenities you’d expect from a modern airport lounge: a fully stocked bar, food and plentiful seating. Plus, there are a handful of interesting features that make the lounge special.Let’s take a look at how you can access the Chase Sapphire Lounge and what to expect on your first visit.First things first: You need access to the lounge. Anyone with a Priority Pass membership can enter any Sapphire Lounge one time per year. Some of our favorite credit cards with Priority Pass memberships include:Note that your Priority Pass membership card is separate from your credit card. You must enroll in the Priority Pass perk and get a Priority Pass card when you are approved for any of these credit cards. You must then carry it with you for access to participating lounges, such as the Chase Sapphire Lounges. Alternatively, you can register your Priority Pass card through the network’s app and access lounges with the provided QR code.Interested in visiting more than once a year with a Priority Pass membership? You’ll need a Chase Sapphire Reserve. Entry for Sapphire Reserve card holders is free and unlimited in the number of times you can access. If you live in Boston, this could be a worthy investment if you fly in and out of Terminal B or Terminal C on a regular basis. Plus, the card will give you unlimited access to other Chase Sapphire Lounges as they open around the world.Chase Sapphire Reserve card holders must have their credit card and Priority Pass card or QR code to enter the lounge. They can bring up to two guests with them when entering the lounge.Beyond lounge access, the Chase Sapphire Reserve is a great credit card for frequent travelers. In fact, we’ve dubbed it the best card for travel purchases. The Sapphire Reserve currently comes with a sign-up bonus of 60,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which you’ll get after spending $4,000 in the first three months. Those points can get you free flights and hotel stays — or save them for a big, once-in-a-lifetime redemption. In addition to the bonus points and lounge access, Sapphire Reserve card holders also get a $300 travel credit each account anniversary year, a fee credit for Global Entry, travel insurance protections and much more.Related: How you can access some of the world’s best airport lounges.The Sapphire Lounge in Boston Logan Airport is located by gate B40 in the Terminal B to C connector. This means you can easily access the lounge when flying a variety of airlines, including JetBlue, which departs from Terminal C, and Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Air Canada and United Airlines, which depart from Terminal B.Once you arrive at the lounge, continue up the elevators to the check-in desk. The lounge was empty when we visited, but we expect it to get busy once the lounge is fully open. Plan accordingly and arrive early if you want to enjoy a meal during peak travel times. The Boston Sapphire Lounge will be open daily from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.Clocking in at nearly 12,000 square feet, there is no shortage of seating in the Chase Sapphire Lounge at Boston Logan Airport. When you turn right after entering the lounge, you’re greeted with restaurant-style accommodations stretching from the buffet to the bar and taproom.Meanwhile, those preferring a more comfortable seat can opt for the lounge chairs and couches behind the check-in counter. This is a more conversational area and is decorated with travel books, artwork and other knickknacks.There’s also plenty of bar seating. Seating is split between the cocktail bar and the taproom, meaning travelers who enjoy all kinds of tipples will be pleased with the options available. Both are packed with different types of seats (high-tops, booths and barstools) and should be plentiful enough to withstand peak travel times.You’ll also find various couches, stools and lounge chairs around the Boston Sapphire Lounge. The options wrap around from the dining area to the bar and beyond, so you shouldn’t have an issue finding a spot that works for you.If you’re looking to work on a laptop, there are two booth-style tables on the far side of the lounge. These are outfitted with power outlets and make for a good place to collaborate or take a quick Zoom call with a decent level of privacy.Food and beverage is the highlight of the Boston Sapphire Lounge. Food is available in the buffet area toward the front of the lounge, and some options are available on a made-to-order basis. You can order food right to your table by scanning a QR code.The menu was designed by acclaimed Boston chef Douglass Williams, who is behind the city’s MIDA and APIZZA eateries. When we visited the lounge, we sampled some of the available food and it was delicious. I recommend trying the Sapphire Burger if you want something substantial before your next flight. You’ll also find meatball subs, soup and a variety of other food.There are two bars in the lounge. One is a taproom, which features beers from various Boston breweries. All beers are served on draft, with two IPA, one lager and one cider on offer at the time of writing. This is a nice touch and a way for Chase to incorporate Boston’s vast brewery scene into the airport lounge.There is also a standard bar that serves a range of specialty cocktails, bottled beers and wine. There are five specialty cocktails on offer, or you can order whatever classic cocktail you’d like. The taproom and bar are located right across the aisle from each other.You’ll also find two beverage stations around the lounge: one in the main dining room and another in the seating area toward the back of the lounge next to the aforementioned booths. These are stocked with espresso machines, drip coffee, soft drinks and water taps. And yes, the espresso machines have an oat milk option.Soft drinks are self-serve and include standard Coca-Cola products as well as interesting options like Olipop craft soda and Spindrift seltzer water. It’s nice to see the Sapphire Lounge offer interesting nonalcoholic beverages, something we don’t often see from other airport lounges.As you’d expect with most of the premium lounge networks, food and beverage are complimentary in the Sapphire Lounge.Beyond the standard lounge amenities, there are a couple of special features to be aware of on your first visit. A dedicated children’s room has toys and other activities to entertain little travelers. The room is secluded from the rest of the lounge and will be a great place for parents to keep their children occupied before departure.There’s also an on-site wellness center with two massage chair booths and three guided meditation areas, all of which are private. This is a great place to relax before a flight, especially if you’re coming straight from a stressful meeting or on a layover from a long-haul flight.There’s also a shower stall on the left-hand side of the lounge. You can reserve this from your phone using a QR code at the entrance to the Sapphire Lounge. It has a private toilet, a shower and luxury toiletries. For travelers who are departing on an international flight and want to freshen up beforehand, this is a great perk to have in the lounge.The first Sapphire Lounge in the US opens to the public in Boston Logan International Airport on May 16 — and it’s a sight to be seen. It’s one of the nicest domestic airport lounges we’ve seen recently, offering excellent food, plenty of seating and a variety of unique amenities like a wellness center and a taproom with local Boston beers. Plus, its modern design and finishes put the lounge miles ahead of the competition from an aesthetic point of view.Anyone with a Priority Pass membership can access this lounge (or any future Sapphire Lounges) once per year. If you want to visit more frequently, you’ll need the Chase Sapphire Reserve card in your wallet. As the lounge Sapphire Lounge network expands to other airports, this could become a big selling point of the credit card.Click here for rates and fees of the American Express Platinum card.Looking to earn travel rewards?

But what exactly makes a “good” travel mug? And how can you pick from the hundreds of options out there?Some of the most important features to look for in a travel mug include double-walled insulation, as well as the ability to keep drinks hot or cold depending on your needs, says Kathryn Anderson, founder of the travel and wellness site Coffee & Mascara. Anderson also recommends looking for travel mugs with a straw, which can be removed when drinking something hot but used when drinking iced coffee or poolside cocktails at a resort — and, the reusable straws are a perfect accessory for being a more sustainable traveler.If you’re planning on moving around with your travel mug, you’ll want leak-proof capabilities. “Look for mugs with a secure lid and a reliable sealing mechanism,” says Andrew Kuttow, blogger at RVCampGear.com. Of course, the right size for your mug depends on personal preferences and the type of journey you’re planning. “Some people prefer a larger capacity for long trips, while others might want something more compact for easy portability.”These are just some of the features to look for in the best travel mugs, but there are others. Before you choose a travel mug for your most important drink of the day, read on to learn which ones we recommend.Looking for a travel credit card?

741,765,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/dance-legacy-cloud-gate-taiwan-intl-hnk/index.html,Dance that comforted Taiwan during its loneliest hour returns to the stage,2023-05-12 20:21:00,"Former US President Jimmy Carter’s decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing sent shockwaves through Taiwan when it was announced in late 1978. With grave existential concerns arising from fears of an imminent Communist invasion from mainland China, people protested on the streets to vent their anger at America’s perceived betrayal. When a US delegation arrived in Taipei for negotiations shortly after, demonstrators threw eggs at the motorcade.In this volatile environment, Taiwan found solace in an unlikely place: a 90-minute dance that, coincidentally, premiered on the day of Carter’s announcement.Performed by the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre troupe, “Legacy” is widely considered to be the first contemporary dance to tell the story of modern Taiwan. It re-enacted the journey undertaken by the 17th-century pioneers who traveled from mainland China, via the choppy waters of the Taiwan Strait, before settling on the island.At a time when Taiwan was searching for its own cultural identity, “Legacy” struck a chord with audiences.“Everyone was on their feet, hands high in the air clapping emotionally,” read an article in the government-run newspaper, Central Daily News, after the debut performance in the Taiwanese city of Chiayi. “Everyone’s heart was tightly bound together.”Wang Yun-yu, a retired Cloud Gate dancer who performed in the 1978 premiere, recalled that some audience members were moved to tears.“The dance was about how our ancestors came to Taiwan and made it home. It was about finding our own roots,” she told CNN in a phone interview. “It closely resonated with the atmosphere of the time, which was that we no longer have the protection of the US, and we have to stand on our own feet from now on.”According to the troupe, more than 20,000 people saw “Legacy” during its first two months. In recent decades, it has been revived in response to other major national crises, serving as a rallying call following a devastating earthquake in 1999 and after the SARS outbreak in 2003, and has now been performed over 170 times — both in Taiwan and overseas. In 1993, it was performed in mainland China.Now, two decades after its last run, “Legacy” is returning to the stage with a sold-out tour marking the dance company’s 50th anniversary. At the end of April, thousands of people gathered in front of the square between Taiwan’s National Theater and the National Concert Hall, in central Taipei, to watch a livestreamed performance on two huge screens.Amid worsening relations with Beijing after Xi Jinping took power in China, there are growing parallels between Taiwan’s political environment today and that in which the dance debuted.The self-governing democracy of more than 23 million people faces an increasingly uncertain future as it embarks on its post-Covid recovery amid mounting military, diplomatic and economic pressure from across the strait.“The timing is certainly interesting,” said audience member Eleanor Chiang, a yoga instructor in her 60s who has seen the dance several times. “I guess such coincidences just happen sometimes.”China’s ruling Communist Party has long claimed Taiwan as its own territory and, despite having never controlled the island, has not ruled out taking it by force. In early April, China conducted a three-day military drill around Taiwan, sending warplanes and vessels near the island after the closely watched meeting between Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California.Whereas Taiwanese felt betrayed by the US after Carter’s decision, in recent years, the island has seen stronger bipartisan support from the US, with high-level congressional visits and increased arms sale.In a promotional video published ahead of the tour, Cloud Gate Dance Theatre’s founder Lin Hwai-min said he would never forget the audience’s response when his ensemble first presented “Legacy.”“Cheers from the crowd erupted as if waters broke the dam,” he recalled.Lin first conceived of “Legacy” while he was studying choreography in New York in the 1970s. It was a period when Taipei faced a string of diplomatic setbacks following the UN’s decision to expel Taipei’s representatives in favor of recognizing the Communist government in Beijing.The political environment — and Lin’s own homesickness — prompted the choreographer to explore his personal connection with the island.Now aged 76, Lin is considered a heavyweight in the Asian contemporary dance scene — and is a household name in Taiwan. In 2019, he retired after almost half a century as Cloud Gate’s art director but was brought back to oversee 2023’s re-staging of “Legacy.”“Legacy” opens with dancers offering incense to honor their ancestors. This is followed by scenes depicting how settlers braved the ocean and ploughed the land, punctuated by Taiwanese folk music and the pounding drums.The dance is known for being physically demanding. Over the course of 90 minutes, dancers leap, climb, bend, squat, roll, stamp and howl, an exhibition of raw and explosive energy that channels the everyday movements of farmers growing crops and working the land.For Lin, the work’s message of endurance and resilience allow it to transcend borders, cultures and eras. And these themes feel particularly poignant on Cloud Gate’s anniversary, given how Lin built the company from scratch at a time when dancing was not taken seriously as a profession in Taiwan — and considering the troupe’s recent struggles, which include a 2008 fire that decimated its studio and archive.“Without the fighting spirit that is integral to the dance, Cloud Gate could not have lasted until today,” Lin wrote in a foreword of a recently-published book, reflecting on the restaging of “Legacy.”For some audience members, such as 30-year-old Chan Wen-ju who works in the publishing industry, the performance is about “overcoming adversities” and “devotion to providing a brighter future” for the next generation.In “Legacy’s” last Taipei performance, Lin bowed to a cheering crowd, saying that all people on the island long for the same thing:“We all wish that the wind and rain come in their time; the country prospers and the people enjoy peace.”To many people in Taiwan, modern dance is almost synonymous with Cloud Gate. As the first professional contemporary dance company in Taiwan, it “not only nurtured many choreographers and dancers, but it fostered the surrounding cultural industry,” said Lin Yatin (no relation to Lin Hwai-min), an associate professor of dance at the Taipei National University of the Arts.Fusing Western and Eastern dance traditions and aesthetics, the troupe was as influenced by ballet, and the renowned American modern dancer Martha Graham as with martial arts, calligraphy, tai chi and meditation.The company has also played a role in projecting soft power, Lin the associate professor said, at a time when the island’s formal diplomatic allies continue to dwindle amid Beijing’s growing pressure.“Diplomacy sometimes has to take place through cultural diplomacy,” she said.“Through its spectacular works of dance, Cloud Gate has reached global audiences, allowing them to appreciate the culture of Taiwan and learn more about Taiwanese people.”Cloud Gate Theater continues its tour of “Legacy” tour around Taiwan until June 10.Top image: A still of dancers performing “Legacy.”",style,0.0
742,766,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/madonna-sex-book-photos-auction-tan/index.html,These controversial photos from Madonna’s ‘Sex’ art book are being sold at auction for the first time,2023-05-12 14:42:00,"Prints of photographs from Madonna’s wildly popular 1992 coffee table book “Sex” will be available for purchase for the first time at Christie’s New York this fall, part of ongoing projects to mark the 30th anniversary of the controversial publication.In October, over 40 prints first published in “Sex” will go up for sale as part of a special standalone auction. Each print will be an edition of one and signed by Madonna and fashion photographer Steven Meisel, who shot the book, with prices ranging from $50,000 on the low end up to $300,000, according to Darius Himes, Christie’s deputy chairman and international head of photographs. Some of the proceeds will go toward Raising Malawi, a nonprofit founded by Madonna in 2006 to support orphans and vulnerable children in the southeast African country.“Thirty years on, ‘Sex’ is still somewhat controversial, but it still reads as a very body-positive, sex-positive book,” Himes said. “It was both shocking and titillating and captured so much white-hot energy coming off of Madonna in the early 1990s.”The publication of “Sex,” which was released in tandem with the pop star’s fifth album “Erotica,” caused a worldwide commotion in the early 1990s. The book included photographs of Madonna and others in the nude and simulating sexual acts. “Sex” also featured Madonna’s then-boyfriend, rapper Vanilla Ice, and stars like supermodel Naomi Campbell and socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg. The Vatican told its followers to boycott the book, which was banned in countries like Ireland and Japan. Still, “Sex” was an instant hit commercially and sold more than 1.5 million copies.The photographs featured in October’s auction were selected by Madonna, Meisel and Anthony Vaccarello, the creative director of Saint Laurent, which released a limited second run of “Sex” last year in Miami to coincide with Art Basel in Miami Beach. Those 800 copies — all signed by the “Like a Virgin” singer — sold out, and a pop-up exhibition of the photographs was a popular draw.Himes described the series of photographs as “both playful and erotic,” adding that Meisel’s images hold up well, even three decades later.“The series captures a moment in time of one of the great fashion photographers of his generation and the queen of pop. While there’s playfulness and campiness, there’s also a classical nude study thing going on. I think they resonate across multiple generations,” Himes says.“Sex” was released around the peak of the AIDS epidemic in the US, Himes notes, and the book featured frank depictions of homosexuality at a time when gay relationships were less accepted in the mainstream.In an October Instagram story, Madonna said she helped pave the way for other female artists to express their sexuality, though at the time she faced backlash for including images of “men kissing men, women kissing women and me kissing everyone.”“I spent the next few years being interviewed by narrow-minded people who tried to shame me for empowering myself as a Woman,” Madonna wrote. “I was called a whore, a witch, a heretic and the devil.”“Sex” wasn’t Madonna’s only controversial foray into art. Last year, she teamed up with digital artist Beeple to release a line of three NFTs (non-fungible tokens) based on a 3D scan of the singer in the nude. The NFTs show Madonna giving birth to creatures like butterflies, centipedes and even a tree.After facing backlash over what some characterized as a vulgar cash grab, Madonna defended herself by saying the project only depicts her doing “what women have been doing since the beginning of time, which is giving birth.”“We’re always operating and living under the male gaze, and unfortunately pandering to what we think people want us to do,” Madonna said during a Twitter Spaces interview with Beeple in May 2022. “It is often a challenge to create works of art … and it isn’t always pretty.”Before the auction in October, the photographs will be exhibited at Christie’s London from May we until June 2, then in Paris from June 27 to July 6 before heading to New York on 30 September, where they will be on display until October 6.",style,0.0

It was used in the earlier Ming dynasty where designs are outlined in blue before being glazed, Bill Forrest, associate director and head of Chinese, Japanese and southeast Asian art at Roseberys, told CNN Thursday.“They definitely have a presence that’s hard to explain,” Forrest said. “A really good piece of imperial porcelain is so well manufactured, so well produced with such skill and care, that they kind of exude a presence that is kind of very difficult to explain.”Chinese imperial porcelain is “rare” and doesn’t come up often, having only been commissioned for the Imperial Court, Forrest said.The 11.5-centimeter (4.5-inch), delicately painted jars display blooming chrysanthemum heads and winding lotus leaves in vivid enameled red, yellow and green with a blue underglaze.Although a prototype for this particular design has not been found, the pattern is recognized on bowls that have been excavated from Ming imperial kilns, according to the listing.According to Forrest, the seller of the jars, who has not been named, is a “passionate collector” of ceramic objects. They saw the items in a thrift store last year and just “had to acquire them,” without even knowing their value.“I think anyone who is in the presence of imperial Chinese porcelain, regardless of their experience, will feel drawn to them on some level,” Forrest said.It was only when the seller researched the inscription found on a label at the base of one of the jars – “Qianlong” – that they realized the potential significance of the porcelain. They then took the items to the auction house for inspection. Both bases are stamped with the six-character seal.Qianlong was the fourth emperor of the Qing dynasty who reigned for six decades.“My heart sinks when I read of Chinese objects being sold through charity chops for a mere pittance,” Forrest said. But he added that Chinese porcelain is a very specialized field and, given the donations charities receive, charity workers can be forgiven for overlooking them.However, he said the seller would donate a “significant portion” of the profits to the charity that owned the thrift store, although no exact sum has been given.Jars with the same design have been sold in past auctions. A pair accompanied with their lids sold at Sotheby’s London for £277,200 (about $347,000) in November 2021.",style,0.0

It was also a night of (nearly as many) custom bodysuits.There was a silvery Courrèges one with an iridescent circular cutout at its center; a sparkling Alexander McQueen one that flared elegantly at the hips; and a Balmain one embroidered with an intricate web of pearls.But the bodysuit that truly set the internet alight came courtesy of Spanish label Loewe.Bejeweled with gold crystal appliqué, the sparkling one-piece featured a series of strategically placed hand motifs, each decorated with long red nails.Two of the “hands” reached up the star’s legs, two covered more intimate body parts and two rested on her posterior (as revealed when the singer turned her back to the audience during a rendition of “Drunk in Love”). She completed the look with a pair of matching black rubber latex gloves with their own sets of red nails.“That Loewe bodysuit Beyoncé is wearing will be in history books,” wrote one Twitter user. “I need that hands bodysuit asap,” wrote another.The look was conceived by Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson, who — fresh from overseeing Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show outfit — is among the world’s most in-demand fashion designers. His sensual hand motifs previously appeared on a sleeveless dress as part of the label’s Fall-Winter 2022 collection, which debuted at Paris Fashion Week last year.Working in collaboration with stylist Shiona Turini, Loewe also created a second bodysuit for the tour. That one was covered in silver Swarovski crystals and was paired with matching cargo trousers. In a press release, Loewe said the two outfits played on “sculptural forms, trompe l’oeil and illusion,” adding that Anderson had been inspired by the “escapist joy” of Beyoncé’s latest album.Wednesday marked the first of Beyoncé’s two-night stop in the Swedish capital, Stockholm. Between now and the end of September, her tour will travel to 40 cities across Europe and North America.The show wardrobe appears to be a veritable who’s-who of high fashion, with designs by Coperni and David Koma also spotted during the three-hour debut performance.In one of the night’s most eye-catching moments, a white gown by innovative Japanese label Anrealage was transformed into technicolor when two mechanical arms “sprayed” it with UV light. Elsewhere, Queen Bey continued her long tradition of wearing bee-inspired stage outfits in a yellow and black Mugler number — complete, of course, with an antennae headpiece.",style,0.0

Be cautious around these rivers and streams as they will be running high and fast, and will also be very cold,” the weather service office in Hanford warns.Overnight temperatures will also stay much warmer than normal, which won’t allow the body the relief it needs from the extreme heat. This could exacerbate heat illnesses for those without air conditioning.The heat will stretch as far north as Canada through the weekend as well. The Canadian weather agency, Environment Canada, has issued a special weather statement warning of the extreme temperatures for portions of British Columbia and Alberta.Temperatures will be running as much as 25 to 30 degrees above normal for some locations, reaching as high as the low 90s, which will make the ongoing wildfire problem even worse.Nearly 150 wildfires are burning across Canada, 82 of which are in Alberta. The province is getting off to one of its fastest starts to the wildfire season this year, with roughly 1.1 million acres already burned to date.“The last time Alberta had this fast of a start to the wildfire season was 2016,” Provincial Information Officer for Alberta Wildfire, Josée St-Onge, told CNN.By this date in 2016, 488 wildfires had burned more than 1.2 million acres. By comparison, so far this year we have seen 426 wildfires, which have burned nearly 1.1 million acres.The wildfire smoke now covers much of Canada and has even entered the Northeast US. Portions of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast are under air quality alerts, including Washington, DC and Philadelphia, as the smoke particles will be unhealthy for sensitive groups.May is a very busy month for wildfires across Canada, and the season typically continues through the summer.

He is sitting on one of a pair of throne chairs that were made for the future King George V and Queen Mary for use at the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902.In the second image, Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, are seen with the eight pages of honor and ladies in attendance who assisted them during the coronation.The images were captured by British photographer Hugo Burnand, who has worked with the royal family for more than 20 years.Charles and Camilla were crowned on May 6, in a magnificent and deeply religious ceremony at Westminster Abbey.The coronation – a symbolic coming together of the monarchy, church and state – was attended by dignitaries from around the world, and thousands of people gathered in on the streets of London to watch the processions to and from the abbey. It was Britain’s first coronation in 70 years.Charles instantly became King in September when his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died at the age of 96.

A rainbow-colored fish that dwells in the ocean’s “twilight zone.” A hairy sloth with a coconut-shaped head.These are just a few of the hundreds of newfound species that scientists described in 2022. The animals join a growing list of more than 1.25 million species that have been scientifically described and cataloged since the 18th century.But what defines an organism as a species that’s new to science? And what exactly is a species, for that matter?Biologists have wrestled with the concept for about as long as the field of biology has existed. Renowned naturalist Charles Darwin wrote in 1859: “No one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species.”Fast-forward to the present, and the debate hasn’t changed much. “There are many definitions, and none of them applies broadly to all life on the planet,” said Bruno de Medeiros, assistant curator of insects at the Field Museum in Chicago.And yet, recognizing and distinguishing between species is vital — and not only for biologists. It’s also necessary for cultivating the food we eat, treating diseases caused by different pathogens, and conserving endangered animals, plants and habitats.The concept is also a critical part of understanding our own evolutionary history and defining our relationship to all life on the planet.Teeming with life, Earth is covered with organisms of all shapes and sizes. Some are too small to see without a microscope. Others may tower hundreds of feet tall. Myriad life forms may gestate in a womb or sprout in soil, hatch from an egg or germinate in a corpse. They could be scaly, chitinous, furry or feathered; perhaps they are leafy, dotted with cilia or slick with slime. They might roam for thousands of miles or spend their lifetimes rooted in one spot.Scientists make sense of all this biological diversity by classifying organisms based on shared ancestry and features such as physical appearance, internal structures and reproduction. A universal, hierarchical classification system was proposed in 1753 by Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus, and it’s still generally followed today. This branch of science is known as taxonomy.The broadest categories for all life on Earth are the domains. There are three domains — Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota — and they organize life based on cellular structure. Eukaryotes have cells that typically contain a single nucleus housing DNA: All multicellular life — animals, plants and fungi — as well as some types of unicellular life, are eukaryotes. Bacteria and Archaea are single-celled microorganisms that don’t have a nucleus, and they are evolutionarily distinct from one another.The next category is kingdoms. In each kingdom, there are subcategories: phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. With each subcategory, the criteria for grouping organisms become progressively more specific and selective.For example, humans are animals. That means we’re eukaryotes in the Animalia kingdom. Our phylum is Chordata, which includes any animal with a spinal cord. We are part of the class Mammalia. Within mammals, we are primates, sharing ancestry with apes, monkeys and lemurs. Our branch of the primate family tree is Hominidae, which includes our closest relatives: the great apes, such as gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos.Finally, we arrive at our genus and species — and our scientific name — Homo sapiens. We are the only surviving lineage in the Homo genus. Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis), our last remaining relatives in the Homo group, went extinct about 40,000 years ago.Theoretically, “a species is a set of populations or one population of organisms that shares a common evolutionary history and reproduces with one another but not outside that group,” according to Nancy Simmons, curator-in-charge of mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.If an animal population in a certain locale looks more or less the same, behaves the same, and mates and generates fertile offspring only with each other, “usually, we call this a species,” de Madeiros added.But color, markings and even size can vary widely within a species; this is true for many species of spiders. Not all life reproduces sexually, so that criteria isn’t universal for defining a species, either. And in some organisms that sexually reproduce, closely related species may interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Coydogs, for example, are fertile hybrids of coyotes (Canis latrans) and dogs (Canis familiaris). Humans and Neanderthals interbred, and portions of Neanderthal DNA linger in the human genome, in people of non-African descent.It can take millions of years for new species to evolve; often, what biologists are observing is evolution in progress. Closely related species can differ from each other a lot or a little — anatomically and genetically — depending on environmental circumstances and when they diverged from a shared ancestor.In the best-case scenarios for describing new species, there are many data sources, Simmons explained. A candidate typically differs physically from its close relatives, with different measurements, different morphology (anatomical structures), or different colors or patterns.“But then ideally we’d have other lines of evidence too — different genetic code or some sort of DNA variation,” Simmons told CNN. Behavior can also distinguish between species. In bats, for example, echolocation calls are often species-specific.All these criteria — anatomy, genetics, behavior and location — enabled Simmons and her colleagues to describe a newfound orange-and-black bat species, Myotis nimbaensis, in 2021.In recent decades, genetic data has transformed classification. Genomic analysis can reveal species-defining differences in near-identical organisms, as de Madeiros discovered while analyzing DNA sequences for palm flower weevils — a type of beetle with an elongated snout — that he had collected in Brazil in 2013 and 2014.Initially, he thought there was a mistake in the data. “I had identical beetles that were clearly very distantly related species,” he said. But when he reexamined the insects, which belonged to the genus Anchylorhynchus, he noticed subtle differences in concave depressions in the males’ undersides. These indentations help the males fit snugly on top of females while mating, and likely are important for helping beetles identify and mate with females from the correct species, de Madeiros said.In many ways, genetic data has made it easier for scientists to tell species apart — but it has also raised its own set of issues, particularly when closely related organisms that look alike and exhibit similar behavior are also very similar genetically.“We get into questions of how much of a percentage of a difference in the genetic code do you have to have to be a distinct species — and people disagree on that, too,” Simmons said. “So, even when we have genetic data, you don’t find complete agreement about how to interpret it.”However difficult it might be to define a species, scientists won’t be running out of new discoveries anytime soon. By some estimates, Earth is home to approximately 8.7 million species — about 6.5 million living on land and 2.2 million in the oceans, which means that roughly 86% of land species and 91% of marine species are yet to be found and described.“We have a great challenge ahead to keep describing this diversity — how it evolves and how it will continue existing on our planet,” de Madeiros said.",world,0.0
750,776,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/3d-printed-mosque-dubai-spc-intl/index.html,World’s first 3D-printed mosque to be built in Dubai,2023-05-03 04:23:00,"In recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from homes to businesses and even bridges. Now, Dubai is set to construct the world’s first 3D-printed mosque.The structure will accommodate 600 worshippers and cover 2,000 square meters over two floors, according to Ali Mohammad Alhalyan Alsuwaidi, head of engineering at the Dubai Government’s Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD). It will be made from a concrete mix, with construction planned to begin by the end of year and expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025.“We elected to 3D-print the mosque because it’s a new and innovative technology that can potentially save time and resources compared to traditional building methods,” Alhalyan Alsuwaidi said. IACAD declined to name the company that will be responsible for the construction.Constructing buildings using 3D-printing requires large printing machines that are programmed with the design information. They squeeze out the construction material from a nozzle, building up the structure in layers. The vast majority of 3D-printed structures are made from concrete, but it is possible to print using other materials, such as clay.Dubai has set out to become the 3D-printing capital of the world, and in 2018 it launched a “3D Printing Strategy” that planned for 25% of the emirate’s new construction to be 3D-printed by 2030.By 2019 it held the world record for the largest 3D-printed structure – the Dubai Municipality building (standing 9.5 meters tall with an area of 640 square meters) – as well as being home to the world’s first 3D-printed office, and a 3D-printed drone research laboratory.But new 3D-printed buildings are popping up across the world – from housing for refugees in Jordan and for homeless people in Austin, Texas, to whole complexes of buildings, such as the 3,800 square foot (353 square meter) Camp Swift military training center, and entire neighborhoods, like the New Story project in Tabasco, Mexico, which will provide homes for families living in poverty.Theo Salet is dean of the Department of the Built Environment at Eindhoven University of Technology, in the Netherlands. He is an advocate for modernizing the construction industry through technology such as 3D-printing.“A vast amount of construction work needs to be done in the coming decades, in the context of a lack of skilled construction workers, an energy transition and a need for the industry to become more sustainable,” he said.“Digital design and construction will save time … reduce construction costs and costs of failures, solve the problem of a lack of construction workers and allow us to rethink our designs in terms of sustainability,” he added.He believes that a project like Dubai’s proposed mosque is the next phase in 3D-printed architectural design, but anticipates it will face challenges.“Realizing a large and eye-catching project like this is quite a task, of a scale yet unknown,” he said. “Without any doubt the 3D printing will work – however, rendered drawings make promises that must be (possible) to meet in practice … A project of this scale and ambition is, in my opinion, a project to learn from and mistakes should be possible.”",style,0.0

When the announcer called Griner’s name on Friday, the crowd cheered wildly, her Phoenix Mercury teammates joined in the applause and she stood up to chest bump one of them.Griner scored 10 points and added three rebounds during the game itself but Phoenix fell to a 90-71 preseason loss against the Los Angeles Sparks. The 32-year-old started the game but only played 17 minutes..“I’m grateful to be here, that’s for sure,” Griner told reporters after the game. “I’m not going to take a day for granted.”She added that all the pregame festivities “hit different” including the national anthem.“Hearing the national anthem, it definitely hit different,” Griner said. “It’s like when you go for the Olympics, you’re sitting there, about to get gold put on your neck, the flags are going up and the anthem is playing, it just hits different. … Being here today … it means a lot.”The two-time Olympic medalist was sentenced to nine years in prison under drug-smuggling charges after authorities in Russia found cannabis oil in her luggage. She was released in December last year in a prisoner exchange.“I didn’t think I would be playing basketball this quickly,” Griner said. “Even coming back, I didn’t know how it was going to go getting back into it.”But after such a long absence away from the court, Griner was critical of her first performance back though she praised her teammates.“Not where I want it to be, but on the right track,” she said. “We’re making the right moves.“When one of us goes down, we’re always right there.

The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord’s, sought to axe the match from the ground’s schedule before granting it a reprieve after some of its members protested.Those arguing for its removal expressed “an appetite to promote cricket as a game for all and as a place where all feel welcome” while those against it stressed the need to maintain “the Club’s history and traditions,” as an MCC statement put it.As a compromise, the MCC announced in March that it would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs. Cambridge fixtures for another five years, before another consultation with members.The club will also host the finals of the UK’s school and university cricket competitions, rather than only the historic fixtures.Actor, presenter and writer Stephen Fry, the current president of the MCC, called on members last year, in an interview with British newspaper The Times, to support stopping the match at Lord’s to help cricket “lose that image it sometimes still has – a turgid image of snobbery and elitism.”“That’s not what cricket is about,” he added. “It’s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it’s available for everybody.”“No-one could have foreseen quite how divided the Club became on this issue,” MCC chair Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement in March, “and the Committee deserves credit for implementing a pragmatic solution that gives those divisions the opportunity to heal, yet also leaves a sensible review mechanism in place.”For the moment, the schoolboys of Eton and Harrow continue to play each other every year on the hallowed, carefully maintained grass at Lord’s.

759,785,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/us/washington-dc-college-scholarship-parents-incarceration-cnnheroes/index.html,This CNN Hero’s nonprofit offers scholarships and support to make college more accessible to children of incarcerated parents,2023-05-12 08:13:00,"Growing up, Yasmine Arrington’s father was in and out of prison and in and out of her life. After her mother passed away when she was 13, Arrington and her two brothers were raised by their maternal grandmother.Having dealt with these struggles from such a young age, Arrington knew firsthand the challenges that came with having an incarcerated parent.“All too often you become marginalized or dismissed as a delinquent,” said Arrington, now 30. “Having an incarcerated father also took a toll emotionally, mentally. … (Incarcerated) parents oftentimes miss graduations. They miss birthdays.”Despite the difficulties, Arrington became a student who was very involved in extracurricular activities. As a high school junior, she joined a leadership and social change program for teenagers called LearnServe in Washington, DC. There, she was asked, “What pisses you guys off?” The intent of the question was for students to analyze issues they saw in their communities, schools, and personal lives. Arrington chose mass incarceration and the effects of parental incarceration on children and families.“My father has literally been in and out of jail and prison my entire life,” she said. “I began to do research, and I learned that there’s so many other people that are kind of my age experiencing what I’m experiencing.”While applying for college scholarships with her grandmother, they noticed that there weren’t scholarships in her region specifically for teens who had incarcerated parents. Yet Arrington knew there were other students like her who had an incarcerated parent and wanted to go to college but needed financial assistance. So, in 2010, when she was 16, she created the nonprofit ScholarCHIPS – with CHIPS as an acronym for Children of Incarcerated Parents – to help young people like herself with scholarships, mentoring and a network of support.The organization has since awarded more than $450,000 in scholarships and other aid and supported more than 80 scholars working toward their college degrees. New scholars join the program each year.“Most of our scholars, when they apply to ScholarCHIPS, they say, ‘This is the first time I’ve ever told anyone’ that they have an incarcerated parent. So, ScholarCHIPS becomes a safe space where young people feel comfortable even divulging and sharing that information,” Arrington said.CNN’s Laura Klairmont spoke with Arrington about her efforts. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What was your experience growing up as a child of an incarcerated parent?Yasmine Arrington: My father is sort of a career criminal, and it’s a cycle that he has gone through for many years and a very, very long time. A lot of times I didn’t even know where my father was. Our communication was always sporadic. Sometimes he would reach out and then I wouldn’t hear from my dad for a long time – a year, two years, or more.I never talked about it in school. It becomes a thing where someone can stereotype you or you can be stigmatized. So, most of the time we’re very silent about it. A lot of times it can get you down, get you depressed. Not having my father in my life for so long, I think that there was a gap in my childhood. And so when I became a teenager and a young adult, I really was looking for love in all the wrong places. I was still very insecure in a lot of ways.Our scholars, they also have, for lack of a better term, suffered mentally, emotionally, or have had challenges. Having a parent that’s absent from the home, and particularly when you know that they’re incarcerated, a lot of questions go through your mind. Some of our scholars have close relationships with their incarcerated parents, and so when they’re able, they will go to visit their parents in prison. And that experience in and of itself is very humiliating. It is demoralizing. It becomes so layered and nuanced and complicated. It just sometimes makes our journey much more difficult.CNN: In addition to scholarships, what are some of the other services you felt were important to provide?Arrington: Our scholars are provided with brand-new laptops. We also have an emergency fund. When scholars have unexpected challenges that come up, for example their car may break down or they may be late on rent. Emergencies could be a number of things. We definitely step in to help.Our scholars have the option (of) being matched with a mentor. And for those scholars who do opt in, we go through a thorough matching process. If a young person has never had someone in their family go to college, then we can match you with a mentor who has gone to college, who’s graduated, who is excited to be a mentor, who wants to walk you through this process, who wants to be a non-judgmental, supportive ear, a cheerleader, and a champion. Mentors serve as a listening ear, which is in many cases very helpful for our scholars. But also sometimes mentors become very resourceful, and they provide scholarship information that comes across their desk to their mentee, internship opportunities, lots of resources and opportunities. And ultimately with ScholarCHIPS, that’s what we want to continue to do – we are a network of support and a safety net which encapsulates within it numerous resources.ScholarCHIPS offers community-building for our scholars, both virtually and in-person. It’s definitely a lifeline. We all are connected, particularly because of the lived and shared experience of having an incarcerated parent. So, we all sort of bond off that shared experience.CNN: You also personally check in with the scholars throughout the year.Arrington: The check-ins are very helpful because oftentimes we will discover a need a scholar has that we otherwise didn’t know. I ask our scholars questions about how their experience is going in college. Are there any challenges that they’re facing? Are there any current needs that they have? A lot of times we grew up where you don’t ask anybody for anything. Because if you do, you’re going to owe them something. Or if you ask somebody for help, that makes you weak. Or we’ve been accustomed to just doing things for ourselves and getting everything for ourselves for so long that a lot of us don’t even know how to ask for help.I definitely stay in contact with scholars well after they’ve graduated. It really is a family of sorts. ScholarCHIPS (is) actually doing the real work (to) help to bridge the gap. And what happens is that not only do our scholars graduate, they gain a sense of confidence and they’re able to self-advocate for themselves once they get into their dream career. Just a little bit of support can go a very, very long way and make a difference not only in one person’s life, but in an entire family and then an entire generation.Want to get involved?

763,789,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/14/politics/philadelphia-mayor-progressives-helen-gym/index.html,Philadelphia’s Helen Gym is focused on her city. Progressives see a national star on the rise,2023-05-14 06:01:00,"Helen Gym does not want the story of her campaign for mayor of Philadelphia to be told as a referendum on the state of the national progressive movement.But for many allies and supporters, in the city and across the country, that view has become increasingly welcome. Gym’s dynamism, decadeslong history of activism and more recent successes grinding through legislation as a city council member make the 55-year-old daughter of Korean immigrants an ideal candidate, they believe, to lead Philadelphia – and also to highlight the movement’s strategic reset and recent successes at the local level.Victory for Gym in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, a field of a dozen now slimmed to nine, would put her on a path to becoming the city’s 100th mayor – and the first woman and Asian American to hold the office. It would also be an exclamation point for many on the left who, after so many recent disappointments, are currently on a remarkable streak of success at the local level.Progressive champions have been elected to run some of the largest American cities, from Los Angeles and Boston, which elected Karen Bass and Michelle Wu, respectively, and, most recently, in Chicago, where former union organizer and relative political unknown Brandon Johnson’s election shocked the Windy City establishment. The left’s focus on local races is a departure for a movement, supercharged by Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign and its national ambitions, that is now more uniformly focused on remaking the Democratic Party from the bottom up.“I’m running for office to change the way people actually live in this city,” Gym said during an interview with CNN at her campaign headquarters last week. “And that has to be felt by the people themselves, not by an ideology, not by a quote-unquote abstract movement. That’s got to be felt by people themselves. And I have to bring it to scale.”During her time on the city council, where she was the leading at-large vote-getter in the 2015 and 2019 elections, Gym helped pass legislation to protect tenants from eviction and to guarantee a range of upgrades to city schools, including the guarantee of full-time nurses and clean water in buildings, as well as a “Fair Workweek” ordinance that promises wage workers fair notice of schedule changes. She is campaigning on a platform that includes a jobs guarantee for adults younger than 30 and the promise to declare a state of emergency on gun violence on her first day in office, along with robust funding for schools and a “holistic” public safety project.“I want political change to be more than just a change of faces,” Gym said, when asked about the historic nature of her campaign. “It just has to be bigger than that. There needs to be a real transformation of what politics can do right now. And especially at the municipal level, where the odds are set against us.”Gym is loath to discuss the national implications of her race, which is widely believed to be headed toward a nail-biting finale between her and three other candidates. Speaking rapidly and often in full paragraphs, all while meticulously peeling an orange, Gym spelled out her broader political vision, arguing that good local government was the only way to change voters’ expectations for Washington – to get them asking, as she put it, “Why do we settle for anything less in our Congress?“Helen really represents the coming of age of the progressive movement,” said Joseph Geevarghese, the executive director of Our Revolution, which says it is mobilizing 40,000 members to make 300,000 voter contacts. “She emerged as a community activist and organizer, she then sought political power, sought to bring movement politics into the political realm. … Helen’s trajectory reflects the trajectory of the progressive movement.”Which also means that there is tough opposition in front of her.Outside spending financed by a conservative billionaire is targeting Gym’s campaign. But in former City Council members Cherelle Parker and Allan Domb, along with Rebecca Rhynhart, a former city controller, she also faces a deep field of strong candidates with robust support across the city’s overlapping power centers. Most observers expect the contest to be decided by the narrowest of margins, with Gym banking on a loyal base and strong turnout powered by her field operation.Gym’s journey, from public school teacher to advocacy work and then lawmaker, also mirrors the evolution of progressives’ relationship with electoral politics. For years, before her first campaign in 2015, Gym did her political work in the streets and with hyper-local issue groups. She joined forces with parents and the teachers union and railed against efforts to privatize Philadelphia’s underfunded, dilapidated public school system, which spent years being starved under state control.In the process, she established a reputation – and widely known political brand – that follows her still, one that has livened the grassroots and attracted the support of leading progressive figures and groups from around the country.But back then, Gym said, she did not see much appeal in trying to join the policymakers.“I didn’t see a lot of power in in holding political office,” Gym said. “I believe that our politics are only as strong as our movements. So if the movement isn’t really strong, your politics are not going to be that strong.”Progressives came more squarely to a similar understanding in the aftermath of another mayoral election, 90 miles north in New York City. Eric Adams’ ascent – in another crowded primary field – was a coup for moderate Democrats who hailed the former police captain as a template for other candidates.After his election in 2021, Adams declared himself the “face of the new Democratic Party,” a boast that rankled progressives but was embraced by many top party officials, including President Joe Biden, who pulled him close.But nearly eighteen months later, Adams’ place in the national Democratic firmament is less clear. His criticism of Biden’s immigration policies has rankled some, especially as Biden enters a reelection campaign. Outside New York, the progressives Adams so enjoyed roasting during his campaign are on a winning streak in major citywide elections.“The election of a conservative Democrat in New York City is certainly the outlier,” said Bill Neidhardt, who worked as a senior adviser to Johnson’s campaign in Chicago and previously worked for Sanders and former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. “Yes, there’s an ideological part, but then there’s also how these elected officials view themselves within the Democratic Party. And for Helen, she’s the one who’s getting support from some of the most well-known Democrats in the country.”Though her national backing comes largely from leading progressive figures – Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are headlining a rally for Gym on Sunday – she also has the support of New Jersey Rep. Andy Kim, a liberal but hardly a firebrand, and mainstream labor groups such as the American Federation of Teachers.In Philadelphia, Gym – while not the only candidate in the running with liberal credentials – has the enthusiastic loyalties of groups such as Reclaim Philadelphia, along with local chapters of the Working Families Party and Our Revolution. The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, Gym’s longtime allies, are also taking a lead role in fueling her volunteer army.Jerry Jordan, the president of the union, said he first met Gym about 25 years ago, around when she formed a group called Parents United. As the state fought to take over the city schools, he said, Gym was there beside teachers marching on Broad Street against a move many assumed would lead to privatization efforts.“Ultimately, the district was taken over in 2001 and, needless to say, there were a number of battles that we faced as a union and as a community,” Jordan said. “Helen has always been there for every one of those fights.”There is an elemental component to clashes over public education, Gym said, that extrapolates well beyond the particular issues being debated.“To me, if you can take away a child’s nurse and counselor, the ability to have a clean, safe learning environment, playgrounds on the schoolyard and after-school programs from the earliest ages,” she said, “you’ll take anything away from anybody. If you can disinvest in a 5-year-old, you’ll disinvest in their parents, you’ll disinvest in their communities, and you’ll disinvest in that city ultimately.”Gym’s willingness to lead the charge, with uncompromising rhetoric that sometimes belies her estimable legislative record, led Philadelphia Magazine to described her in a 2013 profile as an arch “agitator” and the rare “private citizen who works without the heft of any meaningful institutional support” but has “managed to build herself one of the city’s largest bully pulpits.”In nearly a decade since, Gym’s influence – and record – has grown. And her roots in the fight for public education funding and support have dovetailed with renewed popularity and backing for organized labor, including teachers’ unions, which have enjoyed a renaissance over the past half-decade.“The strength of teachers’ unions in these municipal elections is a direct response to the decades of privatization that has been pushed by corporate Democrats,” Neidhardt said, describing a dynamic he observed in Chicago. “Their relentless push to privatize schools is now generating a very energetic pushback from both teachers’ unions themselves, but also grassroots organizers who don’t want to see more schools privatized.”The issue took on heightened relevance in Chicago, where Johnson ultimately ran against Paul Vallas, an enemy of public school advocates around the country, including in Philadelphia, where during his time as CEO of the district he played a lead role in implementing a plan for the widespread privatization of city schools.“I think there is a direct link between the ‘Red for Ed’ teacher strikes (of 2018 and 2019) and the fact that progressive, education-forward candidates are winning,” Geevarghese said. “The strikes were unique in that the teachers were strategic in that they made their fight about the broader community. They foreshadowed what these candidates are fighting for, because those strikes were not just about teacher pay – it’s about what’s happening in our community.”Progressives like Gym, and Johnson in Chicago, have also succeeded where some better-known national figures have stumbled by consciously sowing “a people-power movement and getting away from jargon,” as Gym’s good friend and political ally, Philadelphia City Council Member Kendra Brooks, put it.Ditching inaccessible or more academically tinged rhetoric – “anything that starts with ‘intersectionality’ and ‘marginalization,’” Brooks joked – was among the lessons the left took from Adams’ election in New York.“We realized that in order for us to tap in and activate everyday people, (we need) to speak in terms that they understand, in terms that are relatable, so that they can then carry your message on,” Brooks said. “We’re getting better at it because if the message can’t be carried by the masses, then we’re not winning as organizers.”Maurice Mitchell, the Working Families Party’s national director, said he believes Gym is uniquely equipped to bridge those gaps and deliver the left’s message in more widely appealing terms – especially now as outside money from a wealthy conservative activist is flooding the race.“The policies might be progressive, absolutely, but the coalition has to be broader than people who identify as progressives if you want to lead and govern a major city,” Mitchell said. “And I think Helen is positioned to do both – to articulate a progressive policy agenda in a way that is broad and builds a bigger ‘we’ but also is strong enough to take on the interests that want to sideline that agenda.”Among those seeking to derail Gym are billionaire conservative donor Jeffrey Yass, who has put nearly a million dollars into a new super PAC, called the Coalition for Safety and Equitable Growth, which has spent heavily on ads and mailers targeting Gym in the closing days of the campaign.The Working Families Party, founded more than two decades ago in New York, has a robust presence in Philadelphia and says it has more than 600 volunteers knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors in support of Gym. The organization is also working closely with the PFT and the leading municipal and hospitality workers’ unions. (Parker also has significant labor support, including from the powerful Philadelphia Building Trades Council.)Those Gym allies, like Jordan, the teachers union president, are hoping that the backlash to the late spending galvanizes her supporters and the rank-and-file canvassing for her ahead of the vote.“I cannot tell you the number of tweets, emails, and other kinds of communications that came from our members” in response, Jordan said. “It has motivated our people to knock on those doors for these next few days in order to get out the vote for Helen.”",politics,0.0

Ron DeSantis on the Iowa campaign trail Saturday did not materialize as bad weather, including tornado warnings, forced Trump to cancel a planned rally in Des Moines.“Unfortunately, due to the Tornado Warnings in Des Moines, we are forced to cancel today’s outdoor Rally at the Lauridsen Amphitheater. Stay tuned, we will reschedule soon. Be safe out there!” the former president posted on his Truth Social platform.Trump, who is making his third bid for the White House, has demonstrated an early dominance over the GOP primary field, but his frequent attacks aimed at DeSantis have signaled that he sees the Florida governor as his most serious potential challenger.DeSantis, for his part, has approached the GOP’s 2024 front-runner cautiously as he maneuvers toward a presidential campaign of his own. The governor has spent much of the past month avoiding Trump – dodging the former president’s constant missives and deflecting questions about his potential rival’s mounting legal troubles – and there is little indication he plans to change strategies before he officially gets in the race in the coming weeks.“You know, there’s different stuff in the news, but we’ve been busy,” DeSantis said Wednesday.DeSantis on Saturday tested his Midwest retail politics at Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra’s annual family picnic in the northwestern city of Sioux Center, the most conservative corner of the state. Trump received 82% of the vote in Sioux County in 2020, and evangelical influences run deep through the area’s politics.In his remarks, DeSantis rattled off the conservative policy victories he pushed through Florida’s recently concluded legislative session but included a warning for his party while hinting at a possible presidential announcement.“If we make 2024 a referendum on Joe Biden and his failures and we provide a positive alternative for the future of this country, Republicans will win across the board,” he said. “If we do not do that, if we get distracted, if we focus on the election in the past or on other side issues, then I think the Democrats are going to beat us again, and I think it will be very difficult to recover from that defeat.”In what sounded like a future campaign platform, a forward-looking DeSantis told the audience it was time to restore “sanity,” “normalcy,” “integrity” and “truth” in the country’s approach to education, crime and securing the border. Parents should have more rights than school systems, he said, and criminals should be punished harshly.As he spoke, the Florida governor stood just feet from a large “DeSantis ’24” sign, supplied by Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting his political aspirations. Outside, the super PAC had lined the roads with similar signs and rolled in on a “Team DeSantis for President” bus. On the tables were eight-page booklets touting his biography and accomplishments. Attendees were also offered the chance to sign a pledge to endorse DeSantis for president in 2024.Feenstra’s family picnic, held at the Dean Family Classic Car Museum in Sioux Center, has quickly become a coveted speaking opportunity for Republican presidential hopefuls. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, already a 2024 candidate, headlined the event last year, and former Vice President Mike Pence, who is also weighing a White House bid, spoke at the inaugural picnic in 2021.Trump’s name went unmentioned throughout Saturday’s program in Sioux Center, and several attendees told CNN they were open-minded, if not eager, for an alternative in 2024.“His policies in Florida have really worked well for the state, and we want to have that for the whole country,” Iowan Pam Briese said of DeSantis.Later in Cedar Rapids, at DeSantis’ second event of the day, attendee Rowdy Templer told CNN he would back the governor if he became the GOP nominee but said earning the nomination would not be easy.“It’s probably going to be a pretty good match. President Trump has a lot of loyalty in Iowa and around the country, so I think DeSantis has a steep hill to climb,” Templer said.DeSantis was in Cedar Rapids to keynote a GOP fundraiser, his twelfth such event since March. The first 10 raised more than $4.3 million for local Republicans, his political team told CNN.DeSantis’ speech did not deviate significantly from previous remarks – he outlined his policy achievements and called for “a positive alternative” to Democrats in 2024. In perhaps a telling sign of his future intentions, he also indicated he was not just interested in attracting Republican support.“As much as I wish that a majority of this country were Republicans, that is not the case. So, you want to win the Republicans, of course, but you also gotta win independents,” the governor said.Later, he showed a more personal side of himself during the dinner reception, with the help of his wife, Casey DeSantis, who joined her husband onstage for a Q&A session with Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann.Asked what made him laugh and what made him tear up, the governor answered, “Probably the kids in both instances. 6, 5 and 3.”Casey DeSantis described her husband as someone who “didn’t have any connections” or a “lot of money” but worked his way through Yale University and Harvard Law School. She also emphasized his service as a judge advocate general, or JAG, officer in the Navy.“He’s a good dad. He’s a good person. He’s in for the right reasons. He’s fighting for our children just as much as he’s fighting for your families,” Casey DeSantis said. “His story, in my opinion, is the embodiment of the American dream and everything that we are fighting to preserve for everybody across this country.”The DeSantises later made a brief unscheduled stop at Jethro’s BBQ in Des Moines, a half mile from where Trump had been scheduled to appear.Erin Perrine, a Never Back Down spokeswoman, tweeted that the governor “decided to make a pit stop in Des Moines to meet with supporters on a beautiful Iowa evening.”With Trump on the attack, allies of the Florida governor have begun testing potential counterattacks. Leading up to Trump’s CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Never Back Down called the former president “a candidate who has lost his luster” and suggested he was appearing on the cable outlet to “cling to his eroding ‘frontrunner’ status.” During the Wednesday event, the super PAC cheered on host Kaitlan Collins as she prodded Trump on the unfinished wall at the US-Mexico border, and it accused him of turning on gun owners as president by banning bump stocks.As Trump left the stage, the group tweeted out a list of controversies Trump had spent the hour discussing, including the E. Jean Carroll battery and defamation case, the investigations into “his stash of taxpayer-owned classified documents at Mar-a-Lago,” his attempts to overturn the 2020 Georgia presidential election, and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol and whether he would pardon rioters.“How does this Make America Great Again?” the tweet stated.The missive stood out for its willingness to target Trump over topics DeSantis himself has been loath to weigh in on. DeSantis has repeatedly declined to address questions about the 2020 election results and Trump’s election lies. And when DeSantis has broached these controversies, he has largely stood by Trump.Though he initially said the January 6 attack on the US Capitol was “unacceptable,” DeSantis, on the one-year anniversary of the bloody riot,  called the coverage “nauseating” and “Christmas” for the media to “smear anyone whoever supported Donald Trump.” When the FBI descended on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate to seize classified documents last summer, DeSantis called it “another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies.”Meanwhile, his political team – which operates a “rapid response” Twitter account to quickly counter negative coverage and criticism from perceived political enemies – didn’t tweet at all about the CNN town hall even as Trump suggested the governor was so far back in the polls “he ought to just relax and take it easy and think about the future.”Trump has made the Florida governor a focus of his primary attacks, criticizing DeSantis’ voting record as a congressman on issues such as entitlement overhaul and calling him disloyal for considering a presidential bid after receiving Trump’s endorsement in his 2018 run for governor, a point the former president again raised Friday on social media ahead of the Iowa trip. Trump has also appeared to threaten DeSantis for considering announcing a 2024 bid.“I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering. I know more about him than anybody – other than, perhaps, his wife,” Trump said in an interview last fall with Fox News Digital.Though not uncommon for super PACs to engage in the dirty work of the candidates they support, some of DeSantis’ most staunch online allies appear uncomfortable with the messaging – even in the face of far more aggressive jabs from Trump. It’s the latest sign of the difficult task ahead for Republicans seeking to overtake someone who remains an icon to many in the party.John Cardillo, a conservative influencer who has access to DeSantis’ political operation, in a tweet called Never Back Down’s approach “rehashing stale talking points.”“I swore a Democrat wrote this,” tweeted Brendon Leslie, who runs Florida’s Voice, a website known in the state for its glowing coverage of DeSantis.Never Back Down stood by the approach.“We aren’t afraid to set the record straight and push back on false attacks from potential opponents who are scared of facing the governor should he jump in the race,” Perrine, the super PAC spokeswoman, said in a statement to CNN. “Americans know Ron DeSantis is the future.”Trump’s canceled rally in Des Moines was supposed to have been his first campaign event since CNN’s town hall on Wednesday and his first time in a controlled setting since a jury found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming author E. Jean Carroll.His advisers told CNN his focus would have been on educating voters about caucusing and voter outreach. Trump recorded at least one video that was supposed to have aired during the rally explaining the caucus process and encouraging Iowans to learn about it.DeSantis’ visit was an opportunity for Iowans to see another side of the governor. In a pair of appearances in Iowa earlier this year, he delivered remarks from a stage and stayed behind a rope line to take pictures and sign his new book for attendees.Ahead of the trip, Never Back Down announced that 37 Iowa state lawmakers were endorsing DeSantis, a show of force that included several people in party leadership. Among those supporting DeSantis are state Senate President Amy Sinclair and state House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl, who are seen as young conservative leaders from rural Iowa.Shortly after the super PAC’s announcement, a source familiar with the Trump campaign’s plans said the Trump team would unveil the backing of nearly 150 Iowa county leaders and grassroots activists for the former president.Feenstra said earlier this week he was sticking by plans to stay out of the primary at this time and would not endorse DeSantis at Saturday’s event.“We have great candidates right now and I’m just looking forward to meeting them all,” the congressman said. “We have so many great things in Iowa, and I just show them around.”This story and headline have been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
765,791,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/14/politics/air-force-thunderbirds/index.html,"As US military recruitment dips, elite Air Force demo pilots seek to be ‘beacon of excellence’",2023-05-14 00:06:00,"In a small conference room just off a runway at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, some of the US Air Force’s most elite F-16 pilots were gathered. They spoke casually to one another, snacking on granola bars and fruit; water bottles and paper littered the table beneath laptops and tablets.The 12-person team might have seemed relaxed despite the dangerous maneuvers they were able to pull off, but their focus on the task ahead was clear.The Thunderbirds are the Air Force’s premier demonstration team, performing in dozens of air shows around the country every year. This year marks the team’s 70th anniversary – it was established in 1953, six years after the Air Force split from the Army and became its own service. The intent, according to the team’s current commander and Thunderbird #1 Lt. Col. Justin Elliott – known to his teammates simply as “one” or “boss” – was to “connect the American population to its military at a time when institutional trust was challenged.”It’s a challenge the Air Force, and military as a whole, is facing again.The Navy, Army and Air Force have all said they do not expect to meet their recruiting goals this year, continuing a challenging trend from 2022, which saw record lows. For months, military leaders have pointed to the economy, a low desire to serve and a lack of knowledge among young people about what the military does as factors that are hurting recruitment.But while the recruiting situation has become more dire over the last couple of years, the mission generally hasn’t changed for the Thunderbirds, who this year have more than 30 air shows scheduled around the country. Throughout their travels, the team regularly engages with the public, hoping to give people everywhere a peak behind the curtain of military service.“We’ve been there many times in history,” Elliott told CNN about the gap between the American public and its military.“It is a good thing to be unifying force in a dividing time,” he added, “to create a beacon of excellence that people can look up to and say, ‘I don’t care if you’ve been here for five minutes or five generations, we’re your Air Force.’”The pilots flying for the Thunderbirds – who almost exclusively call one another by their position number on the team or their call signs – are based out of Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. But they spend the vast majority of their two-year assignment with the Thunderbirds on the road, either rehearsing for air shows, flying in them or traveling to the next one.That time on the road was increased by Elliott, who said it was critical that the team as a whole – including more than 100 enlisted airmen who monitor the aircraft, repair and inspect fuel systems, and maintain oxygen masks and parachutes – is able to practice the other parts of the show, which help keep the pilots safe.Despite the ease that the six demo pilots project, the flying they do is inherently dangerous and made possible by the meticulous preparation happening behind the scenes. Elliott, who has flown 30 different aircraft with more than 2,555 total flight hours throughout his career, attended the Air Force’s Weapons School and served as an operational and experimental test pilot. He said the flying he does with the Thunderbirds is the “hardest thing I’ve ever done.”CNN was invited earlier this month to ride along with a pilot in his F-16 as the team rehearsed for the weekend’s show. It was the first time a guest was able to watch from the air as the demo pilots rehearsed their carefully choreographed barrel rolls, aileron rolls, and flew just 18 inches apart in the team’s famous four-ship diamond formation.Ahead of the flight, guests flying with the team are required to go through training to prepare for things such as gravity force (G-force) or even possible ejection from the aircraft. Squeeze the muscles in your lower body to push the blood back up to your head, so you don’t pass out; breathe in a specific rhythm called hook breathing; lean your head back so you don’t feel the weight of increased gravity on your neck.And, just as important, avoid hitting or touching certain buttons, levers or switches in the cockpit.It doesn’t seem like much to think about: Squeeze, breath, don’t touch anything. But that’s to say nothing of the additional demands of being an F-16 pilot, which require taking all those steps to stay conscious and simultaneously maintaining the presence of mind to fly safely.And in the case of the Thunderbirds, to make it all look and sound effortless.While CNN was in the air with Lt. Col. Ryan “Slinga” Yingling, Thunderbird #7 and director of operations, the six performing pilots ran through the show they would do for a crowd below just days later. Despite the difficulty of the maneuvers they were carrying out, over the radio they may as well have been commenting on the weather or a sporting event.As their jets gracefully whirled past each other with extreme precision, they could be heard whooping and cheering in unison, exchanging quips and remarks about the impressive stunts they had pulled.Every maneuver is planned down to the second and pored over in extreme detail as soon as the team has landed safely. In the debrief following their rehearsal, the team members walked through a video recording of the flight they’d done moments before, moving frame by frame, offering praise and, at times, constructive criticism of their own flying.More than once throughout the day, Thunderbirds team members remarked that they were only able to do what they do because of the cohesiveness of their unit. That was made clearer as the pilots worked through their debrief, which was conducted as seamlessly as their rehearsal.That ability to work on a team is a significant part of what the Thunderbirds look for in pilots applying to join. It was also one of the things repeatedly mentioned by the pilots as to why they love their jobs so much.There’s “no ego,” Yingling said. Each person gains “an entire family that we’ll take with us forever,” said Capt. (Dr.) Travis “Angry” Grindstaff, Thunderbird #9 and the team’s flight surgeon.It’s a “small-team mindset on a huge team,” added Capt. Zachary “Zeke” Taylor, Thunderbird #2 and the left wing pilot for the squadron. “Everyone is a go-getter and super happy to be here. They want to be here.”Sitting around that conference room table at the end of the debrief, all members of the 12-person team spoike of that what drew them to the Air Force, and to the Thunderbirds specifically. Their answers ranged from family ties to service, to hearing about fighter pilots as a kid in school.But Grindstaff, like so many throughout the military, said the Air Force seemed like it would provide him a pathway to more opportunities in life. He said he “grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere, with no money” and saw the service academies as his chance to get an education and a career. So he decided to go to the Air Force Academy, which gave him “all the opportunities I have now.”“I got to graduate from college and then went to medical school on the Air Force’s dime, got to pursue all my dreams,” Grindstaff said. “And I realized there’s probably a lot of people out there that were similar to me, and what a cool experience it would have been for them to be able to know something that they had, like an academy, in their pocket, that would not only allow them to get an education, but then pursue their dreams and be a part of something like this.”",politics,0.0
766,792,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/politics/kentucky-governor-republican-primary-election-trump/index.html,Kentucky GOP governor primary tests Trump’s influence ahead of 2024,2023-05-13 15:28:00,"Republicans in Kentucky will decide their nominee for governor on Tuesday in the party’s first major primary since last year’s midterm elections – and one with implications for the 2024 GOP presidential race and the battle for Senate control.The race will test former President Donald Trump’s influence with GOP voters as he seeks a return to the White House. It will also weigh conservatives’ appetite for cultural fights over transgender rights, tough-on-crime messaging and more.Three states are hosting governor’s races this year, with Kentucky’s likely to be the most competitive. Mississippi and Louisiana also hold gubernatorial contests this fall.The Republican race to take on Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has been bitter. State Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a former staffer for Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, entered the race as the heavy favorite. But Kelly Craft, who served as Trump’s ambassador to Canada and then to the United Nations and is the wife of billionaire coal magnate Joe Craft, has pumped millions of dollars into television ads in the race.Other GOP candidates include Ryan Quarles, the state agriculture commissioner who has focused his campaign on rural areas of the state, state auditor Mike Harmon, conservative activist Eric Deters and Somerset Mayor Alan Keck.Meanwhile, Beshear’s bid for a second term could be an important bellwether for 2024, when his party is defending Senate seats in several other red states – West Virginia, Montana and Ohio.Beshear, whose father was a two-term governor, defeated Republican Gov. Matt Bevin – an unpopular incumbent who had angered many in his own party – in 2019. He is considered a shoo-in to fend off two challengers in Tuesday’s Democratic primary.At the center of the conflict between the two front-runners, Cameron and Craft, is Trump.The former president endorsed Cameron – who had a prime speaking slot at the 2020 Republican National Convention and has been viewed by many in the GOP as a rising star – in June 2022, even though Craft, who had worked in his administration, was still considering entering the race.Trump is expected to join Cameron for a get-out-the-vote tele-rally on Sunday, the Cameron campaign announced.“President Trump knows that I am the right candidate to lead Kentucky and the only candidate he has endorsed in this race,” Cameron said in a news release Saturday.Cameron was elected Kentucky attorney general in 2019 – the first Republican to do so in more than 70 years. If he wins the primary and general elections this year, he would become the first Black Republican elected governor anywhere in the United States. (Two Black Republicans served as acting governor of Louisiana in the 1870s, during the Reconstruction era, but neither were elected.)Craft has downplayed Trump’s endorsement of Cameron, noting that it came when she was not officially in the race.Cameron, in a debate earlier this month, shot back by pointing out that Trump attended the Kentucky Derby alongside Craft last year – and, weeks later, endorsed Cameron.“Kelly, you spent six months telling folks that you were going to get the Donald Trump endorsement. You had him at the Derby last year. And then I got the endorsement. And your team has been scrambling ever since,” Cameron said at the debate hosted by Kentucky Educational Television.Craft has sought to latch Cameron to McConnell, portraying her opponent as a political insider who, she says in one ad, would “rather follow than lead.” She has also campaigned on a tough-on-crime message and lambasted Cameron for allowing the Justice Department to investigate Louisville’s police department after officers shot and killed Breonna Taylor, prompting national backlash, in 2020. In a TV ad, Craft’s campaign described the Justice Department as “woke” and its probe as a “big government takeover.”“Letting big government push their diversity agenda while crime skyrocketed, they failed Kentucky’s law enforcement,” the ad’s narrator says.Craft has also leaned into attacks on transgender rights while slamming what she calls “woke ideology” in schools.“We will not have transgenders in our school system,” she said Monday during a telephone town hall – a remark that prompted criticism from pro-LGBTQ rights advocates in Kentucky.For his part, Quarles has sought to win over voters who may be turned off by the ad battles between Cameron and Craft.“It’s important that Republicans nominate a candidate who can unite the party,” he said in the early May debate. “There’s no problem with having disagreements on issues and policies and voting records, etc. But it’s important that if we’re going to defeat Andy Beshear, we need to nominate somebody who wants to help lift other people up and unite the party after May 16.”Despite the attack ads and debate-stage barbs, GOP observers say differences on policy matters between the candidates are minimal.“It’s more of a personality-driven campaign,” said Tyler Glick, a Republican public affairs consultant based in Louisville. “I don’t think it’s been so much fought out over the issues as just positioning their story and their approach.”While the governor’s race is Kentucky’s marquee contest of 2023, Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams – who has won bipartisan praise for his work with Beshear and the GOP-led legislature to expand mail-in and early voting faces two primary opponents in his bid for a second term.One opponent, information technology project manager Steve Knipper, who has lost two previous bids for the state’s chief elections role, has claimed without evidence that there was fraud in the 2019 governor’s race won by Beshear. Another contender is Allen Maricle, a former state lawmaker.Adams said in an interview on KET this month that his rivals were pushing “crazy myths” about election fraud.“The bottom line is our elections are more secure now than they’ve ever been,” he said.Like the gubernatorial contest, the winner of the GOP primary for secretary of state only needs a plurality of the vote to land the nomination. Former state Rep. Buddy Wheatley is unopposed for the Democratic nomination.This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
767,793,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/13/politics/joe-biden-howard-university-commencement-speech/index.html,Biden previews 2024 election pitch to young Black voters in Howard University commencement speech,2023-05-13 14:27:00,"President Joe Biden previewed his 2024 election pitch to young Black voters Saturday in commencement remarks at a Howard University graduation ceremony in Washington, DC, articulating his vision of a “future for all Americans,”Biden’s speech to graduates of the historically Black university had deep political undertones, and he reiterated to graduates that the work to “redeem the soul of the nation” continues, a phrase he uses often to contrast himself with his predecessor, Donald Trump, who is seeking a return to the White House next year.“We can finally resolve those ongoing questions about who we are as a nation – that puts the strength of our diversity at the center. A future for all Americans, a future I see you leading,” Biden told the graduates at the Capital One Arena.Though Biden did not name the former president, Trump’s legacy, rhetoric and policies hung over his remarks. Biden recalled his decision to run for office again amid the horror following the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, riots, and Trump’s “famous quote” that there were “very fine people on both sides.”“Fearless progress toward justice often means ferocious pushback of the oldest and the most sinister of forces. That’s because hate never goes away,” the president said.“It only hides under the rocks. And when it’s given oxygen, it comes out from under that rock,” he said. “That’s why we know this truth as well: Silence is complicity. It cannot remain silent.”The campaign-style speech came less than a month after Biden announced his bid for a second term as a potential debt default looms and his administration braces for an expected surge in migrant border crossings following the expiration of the Title 42 border policy.Black voters remain a key part of the Democratic Party coalition. A drop in turnout among Black voters in the 2022 midterms raised alarms among Democratic operatives over what it could mean for 2024, CNN previously reported. A recent Washington Post-ABC News survey put Biden’s approval rating among Black people at 52% – a considerable drop from 82% when he took office.Biden’s speech Saturday also previewed the platforms he expects to prioritize on the campaign trail. He called out Republican-led efforts that he cast as seeking to chip away at rights for transgender children and affordable health care and housing.Biden also received applause for political promises on marijuana decriminalization, climate change investment and student loan forgiveness. He conceded there was still “more to do” on gun violence, reiterating calls for an assault weapons ban, as well as a comprehensive police overhaul, both issues that do not currently have the votes to pass in Congress.“Fundamental questions are at stake for our nation: Who are we? What do we stand for? What do we believe? Who will we be? You’re here to help answer those questions,” he told the Howard students.Howard University, Vice President Kamala Harris’ alma mater, has received an ample amount of focus from the Biden administration since the pair took office in 2021. Last month, Harris delivered a fiery speech on abortion rights during a rally on the Howard campus, and the university recently became the first historically Black college or university, or HBCU, to partner with the Department of Defense to lead a university-affiliated research center.HBCUs at large remain a priority for the Biden administration, a White House official previously told CNN. The president spoke at the fall commencement at South Carolina State University in 2021 and delivered a virtual address for HBCU students in June 2021, amid a surge in the Covid-19 pandemic. He has also reestablished the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for HBCUs.However, Biden has yet to fulfill his proposal of nearly $45 billion in funding to fix weathered HBCU campuses and help modernize the historic institutions and the communities they serve. So far in his tenure, the president has distributed nearly $6 billion worth in investments through the Department of Education.For his next commencement address, Biden is expected to head to El Paso County, Colorado, on June 1 to speak at the United States Air Force Academy’s graduation ceremony.This headline has been updated.",politics,0.0
768,794,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/13/politics/north-carolina-abortion-roy-cooper-veto/index.html,"North Carolina Democratic governor vetoes abortion ban, setting up likely override vote",2023-05-13 12:23:00,"North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a controversial bill that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks, setting up a likely override effort from the state legislature, where Republicans have a supermajority.Cooper’s swift veto comes just over a week after the Republican-controlled state Senate advanced the bill to his desk in a party-line vote.Speaking to a crowd of supporters at a rally in Raleigh before his veto, Cooper urged those gathered to put pressure on four state Republican lawmakers who had previously vowed to protect abortion rights to stand by their comments and not join any veto override.“We are going to have to kick it into an even higher gear when that veto stamp comes down. If just one Republican in either the House or the Senate keeps a campaign promise to protect women’s reproductive health we can stop this ban,” Cooper said at the Saturday rally. “But that’s going to take every single one of you to make calls, to send emails, to write letters. Tell them to sustain this veto. Tell them to ask the Republican leadership to stop it.”Ahead of the veto, Cooper had moved to escalate pressure on the four Republicans – state Reps. Ted Davis, John Bradford, Tricia Cotham and Republican State Sen. Michael Lee – by paying visits to their districts. All four previously vowed to protect abortion rights and held roundtable discussions there on the topic in the hopes of appealing to those lawmakers and their constituents.CNN has reached out to the lawmakers for comment. Davis declined to comment on his plans, while the others have not responded.If both chambers approve the override by three-fifths majority, the bill becomes law. If it does not get the votes, then the governor’s veto remains.Demi Dowdy, a spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, told CNN she is confident lawmakers will override Cooper’s veto and dismissed his efforts to “press these Republican members into voting his way.”Republicans in the state gained a veto-proof supermajority last month when then-Democratic Cotham switched parties. Cotham, who had campaigned in favor of abortion rights as a Democrat, was one of the Republicans who voted for the bill. She also sponsored legislation earlier this session to codify Roe v. Wade.State legislators have already shown they are not afraid to use their newfound powers to override Cooper’s vetoes. In March, the state legislature overrode Cooper’s veto on a bill that now makes it legal to purchase a pistol without a permit in the state.North Carolina had been a haven for women seeking abortion care as Southern states tightened restrictions after the Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion rights back to the states.If Cooper’s veto is not sustained, the bill – Senate Bill 20, dubbed the “Care for Women, Children and Families Act” – would ban any licensed physician from performing surgical abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy. It would provide exceptions in the case of rape and incest through 20 weeks of pregnancy or in the event of a “life-limiting anomaly” through 24 weeks.Under the bill, the procedure could be performed by a physician if a doctor determines an abortion is necessary to avert death – “not including psychological or emotional conditions.”Under current state law, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. A reduction to 12 weeks would be significant but less restrictive than some other GOP-led states that have recently enacted six-week or near-total bans on the procedure.The bill would also prohibit health care providers who objects to abortion “on moral, ethical, or religious grounds” from being required to participate in medical procedures that would result in an abortion.It also calls for in-person examination by physicians seeking to prescribe or administer abortion-inducing drugs and would prohibit people within the state from mailing such drugs to a pregnant woman. The bill would mandate that doctors confirm that the “probable gestational age” of a fetus is no more than 10 weeks before they can sign off on a medication abortion.This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
769,795,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/politics/florida-lawsuit-immigration/index.html,What to know about Florida’s challenge to the immigration parole policy,2023-05-13 11:22:00,"A federal judge late Thursday night temporarily blocked one of the Biden’s administration’s key tools to try to manage the number of migrants in US Customs and Border Protection custody.The ruling came just before Title 42 expired, and administration officials say it will make their job more difficult amid the expected influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border. An appeal is expected.Here’s what to know:The plan, released Wednesday, allowed the release of migrants from CBP custody without court dates, or, in some cases, releasing them with conditions.As number of migrants increases at the border, the Department of Homeland Security said its plan would help release the immense strain on already overcrowded border facilities. As of Wednesday, there were more than 28,000 migrants in Border Patrol custody, stretching capacity.The administration previously released migrants without court dates when facing a surge of migrants after they’re screened and vetted by authorities. The plan would have allowed DHS to release migrants on “parole” on a case-by-case basis and require them to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Florida sued to halt the policy, and District Judge T. Kent Wetherell, agreed to block the plan for two weeks.Wetherell, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, said the administration’s explanation for why its policy was only unveiled on Wednesday, when the end of Title 42 was anticipated for months, was lacking. He also said the Biden administration simply failed to prepare.“Putting aside the fact that even President Biden recently acknowledged that the border has been in chaos for ‘a number of years,’ Defendants’ doomsday rhetoric rings hollow because … this problem is largely one of Defendants’ own making through the adoption and implementation of policies that have encouraged the so-called ‘irregular migration’ that has become fairly regular over the past 2 years.”Wetherell added: “Moreover, the Court fails to see a material difference between what CBP will be doing under the challenged policy and what it claims that it would have to do if the policy was enjoined, because in both instances, aliens are being released into the country on an expedited basis without being placed in removal proceedings and with little to no vetting and no monitoring.”Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, speaking on “CNN This Morning,” called the ruling “very harmful” and said the administration is considering its options.“The practice that the court has prevented us from using (is) a practice that prior administrations have used to relieve overcrowding,” Mayorkas said. “What we do is we process screen and vet individuals and if we do not hold them, we release them so that they can go into immigration enforcement proceedings, make whatever claim for relief, they might and if they don’t succeed, be removed.”Assistant secretary for border and immigration policy Blas Nuñez-Neto said the ruling “will result in unsafe overcrowding at CBP facilities and undercut our ability to efficiently process and remove migrants, which will risk creating dangerous conditions for Border Patrol agents as well as non-citizens in our custody.”Wetherell’s ruling will block the policy for two weeks. A preliminary injunction hearing has been scheduled for May 19.The Justice Department has requested a stay on the court ruling, according to a Friday filing. The filing addresses two separate rulings in the case, both of which have to do with the release of migrants. If the request is not granted, the Justice Department said it intends to seek emergency relief from the Eleventh Circuit by Monday afternoon.This story has been updated with additional information.",politics,0.0
770,796,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/politics/republican-governors-letter-transgender-sports-ban-title-ix/index.html,Republican governors call for withdrawal of proposed Title IX rule changes around transgender student athletes,2023-05-12 23:04:00,"A group of 25 Republican governors called on the Biden administration Friday to withdraw or delay recently proposed rule changes to Title IX that could prevent states from enforcing anti-transgender sports bans.As several bills that aim to ban transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity make their way through GOP-led state legislatures across the country, the governors argued in a letter sent to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona that such bans ensure fairness.Led by Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, the group – including the governors of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming – slammed the administration’s proposal as “a blatant overreach.”In April, the Biden administration proposed a new federal rule change for Title IX that would prohibit policies that “categorically” ban transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender. However, according to a public notice from the department, the proposal would allow schools to enforce some restrictions in “competitive” environments.“Leaving aside the Department’s utter lack of authority to promulgate such a regulation, neither states nor schools should be subjected to such a fluid and uncertain standard,” the governors said in the letter. “Nor, most importantly, should the historic advancements and achievements of our sisters, mothers, and daughters be erased.”The governors went on to argue that the proposed changes create confusion for states and schools and claimed that the government was threatening to withhold federal funds to coerce schools to comply with a “completely subjective standard that is based on a highly politicized gender ideology.”CNN has reached out to the Department of Education for comment.Seventeen of the states signed onto the letter have enacted such bans with a few facing legal challenges, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that advocates for issues including LGBTQ rights. This week, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill prohibiting students from competing in gendered athletic competitions that do not match their biological sex as listed on a birth certificate or government record, and the governor is expected to sign the measure.Proponents of such limitations in sports have argued that transgender women have a physical advantage over cisgender women and allowing them to compete would be unfair. However, a 2017 report in the journal Sports Medicine found “no direct or consistent research” on any such advantage.When the proposed rule changes were announced, advocates celebrated the new protections but called on the administration to eliminate the exemptions.“Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. This includes transgender girls of all ages and in all sports, without exception,” said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy group.“The new rule should be clarified to ensure that all transgender students should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity,” Robinson added in a statement at the time. “This moment we’re in is truly a crisis for transgender young people – and we’re calling on elected leaders at every level of government to fight harder for our kids.”Democratic governors of several states whose legislatures have pushed anti-trans sports bans were not listed among the letter’s signers, including from North Carolina, Kansas and Kentucky. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, more than 470 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced nationwide this legislative session.",politics,0.0

Henry McMaster has called the state legislature back for a special session Tuesday to continue to work on a bill that would ban most abortions as early as six weeks and other legislation.“I have called the General Assembly back for an extra legislative session to take up enhanced penalties for illegal gun possession, pass bond reform, protect life, and pass a budget,” McMaster said in a tweet on Friday. “The General Assembly has made progress this year, but there is still work to be done.”The General Assembly ended its legislative session on Thursday but had yet to pass Senate Bill 474, otherwise known as the “Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,” which would ban most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo. Such activity can commonly be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.The bill offers exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies, or to prevent the death or “irreversible impairment of a major bodily function” of the mother throughout the pregnancy. It also would allow exceptions up to 12 weeks for cases of rape, incest, or if the pregnant person is under the age of 17.The legislation passed out of the Republican-controlled state Senate in February but has yet to pass the state House.South Carolina passed a similar 6-week abortion ban in 2021, but the state Supreme Court struck it down earlier this year, concluding that the state constitution’s privacy protections require limits on the procedure to allow women sufficient time to end a pregnancy.Recent efforts to pass further restrictions on abortion also faltered in April when the state Senate failed to pass the “Human Life Protection Act,” which would have banned most abortions in the state, in a 22-21 vote with five women voting against it – including three Republicans. The bill had previously passed in the state House and included exceptions for incidents of rape or incest.",politics,0.0
772,798,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/13/politics/supreme-court-shadow-docket-what-matters/index.html,How Congress lost control of the Supreme Court,2023-05-13 08:15:00,"The Supreme Court holds more power than it used to and, thanks to its “shadow docket,” can make consequential decisions that affect every American without so much as a written decision.That’s my takeaway from a fascinating and educational new book by Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas who is also a CNN contributor.I talked to Vladeck about “The Shadow Docket: How the Supreme Court Uses Stealth Rulings to Amass Power and Undermine the Republic,” which publishes on May 16. Excerpts of our conversation, conducted by phone, are below.WOLF: Can you explain to people what you mean by “shadow docket”?VLADECK: The term is not mine. It was coined by University of Chicago law professor Will Baude in 2015.Will meant it really as this umbrella term.  Not as a pejorative, but just as a description of the fact that the vast majority of rulings that the Supreme Court hands down that we don’t pay attention to.They’re not the fancy decisions on the merits docket. They’re not the cases where the court hears oral arguments and writes these lengthy rulings with concurrences and dissents.The typical shadow docket ruling is an unsigned, unexplained order. And most of them are banal. But not all of them.Will’s insight, which I have rather shamelessly appropriated, is that there’s a lot of really important stuff that happens through unsigned, unexplained orders. Just because they’re unsigned and unexplained doesn’t mean that we ought not to care about them, talk about them, study them and try to divine broader patterns from them.WOLF: You write about how the court, without explaining itself, either invalidated or influenced congressional maps in the last election in three states: Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana. Right now, Republicans have a four-seat majority in the House. Do you feel like those decisions determined the outcome of who was going to control the House?VLADECK: I think it’s close. We’re talking about two decisions from the court in cases from Alabama and Louisiana, and then those decisions were directly followed in Georgia.There’s no question that, but for the court’s interventions, at least three House seats in the current Congress would likely have been controlled by Democrats as opposed to Republicans.What I think is really hard to say is what other effects might have followed. The New York Times has suggested that those decisions affected control of as many as seven to 10 House seats. That, I think, is a little more circumstantial.There’s no question that the decisions in the Alabama and Louisiana cases helped to give the Republicans the majority they currently have in the House. Whether they actually directly affected control, I think is a close call.WOLF: Justice Samuel Alito is unapologetic about use of the shadow docket. Chief Justice John Roberts and other conservatives dislike it. How have things changed in recent months? Has it been used more or less since you stopped writing this book?VLADECK: With regard to what I think is the problematic behavior on the shadow docket, I think we have seen less of that in the current term. And actually, I think we can see patterns of that go all the way down to October 2021, when Justice (Amy Coney) Barrett wrote this very, very cryptic concurrence in a case about the Covid vaccine mandate for Maine health care workers.It was delphic in what it said, but signaled a bit of a break between Barrett and (Brett) Kavanaugh, who joined that opinion, and Justices (Clarence) Thomas, Alito and (Neil) Gorsuch in how often they were going to be willing to vote to intervene on the shadow docket and what kinds of cases they were willing to intervene in.Last week, the stay in the Oklahoma death penalty case, Richard Glossip, there were no dissents from that intervention. Even the mifepristone ruling in April, there are only two public dissents.One of the really interesting stories here is the court really does seem to have moderated at least some of its behavior. Part of that, I think, is because to at least some degree, the median justices have become convinced that some of the court’s prior behavior is problematic.WOLF: Do you have thoughts on motivations behind the rise of the shadow docket, which you pegged to the seating of Justice Barrett and this new conservative supermajority? Do you think that there was some concerted effort by the more conservative justices to exploit this?VLADECK: I think the short answer is no. But I know that there are going to be folks who disagree.The book tries to unpack some of this chronologically, because I think the story makes a lot of sense when told in sequence.Starting in 2017, the court was confronted with an unprecedented flurry of emergency applications from the Trump administration. It reacted to those applications iteratively, one at a time, without actually stepping back and looking at the whole waterfront, so the court actually kept digging itself in deeper and deeper.Had the justices actually taken a step back and asked whether this was a practice they wanted to condone, they might not have said yes. And I think with each new intervention, with each successive case, what had previously been extraordinary became ordinary.Without there necessarily having been any deliberateness or malice, the conservative majority just routinized the types of interventions that had until 2017 been completely unroutine.It’s only when we get to the Covid cases in 2020 and 2021 that now it starts to look like some of this is willful, because it’s only in those cases where we see the court deciding legal questions on the shadow docket through emergency applications that were in front of the justices already on the merits docket.There was nothing stopping the court from using merits cases to reach these questions about religious liberty, and the court did it through the shadow docket anyway.I really think it started as just an unstructured off-the-cuff reaction to unusually aggressive behavior by the Trump administration and then just sort of morphed into something else as time went on.WOLF: You point to the Obergefell decision (legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide) to argue that the court had already spoken on same-sex marriage through years of inaction. There was a patchwork of marriage laws the court had tolerated for a number of years. Reading that made me think we’re returning to that with abortion rights. And certainly with guns. The patchwork nature of rights in this country is growing not shrinking, despite the gay marriage decision.VLADECK: I think it’s grown in some respects and is shrinking and others. The more that the Supreme Court constitutionalizes things, the less of a patchwork we have.If you look at the Second Amendment context, I think it’s actually less of a patchwork, because more and more variances in how localities regulate guns are being struck down by the courts for violating the federal Constitution. Versus contests where the court is stepping away from constitutional enforcement, like abortion. It’s more contextual than sort of categorical.WOLF: I’ve done a lot of writing about the filibuster, which is this custom that has evolved to be a major part of the US government and slowed or stalled legislation in Congress. Your descriptions of how the court has evolved reminded me of that. You argue the justices have essentially grabbed power from Congress over the last 100 years or so to gain more control over their docket.VLADECK: When we look at the court today, we see a court that controls virtually all of its docket, a court that decides not just which cases it’s going to hear, but which issues it’s going to decide within the cases it chooses to hear.For most of us, we’ve never known anything different. And so we just assume that that’s how the court is supposed to operate.The reality is totally different. Until 1891, and really in practice until 1925, virtually all of the court’s docket was mandatory – the court had to decide any case over which it had jurisdiction.That made it a lot harder for the justices to have an agenda. It made it a lot harder for the justices to target particular disputes and look around for cases. The rise of certiorari, of docket discretion, is actually a thoroughly untold but undeniable part of the story of why today’s Supreme Court is so powerful, despite the founders’ views that this would be the least dangerous branch.The court today actually has a ton of power. Some of that story is about a power grab.But a fair amount of the story is about acquiescence and abdication by Congress, which gave the court the certiorari power in the first instance; which never reined it in, even as the court has seemed to used it to claim more and more power; and which in 1988 took all the brakes off of certiorari and said, yep, just about all the court’s docket is going to be discretionary – and which has done absolutely nothing since then to exercise any modicum of control over the court’s docket.That’s why the story that the book tries to tell is not just a story about the court. It is a story about the separation of powers and how the shadow docket is in some respects just a symptom of the broader disease of separation of powers dysfunction that we’re seeing right now.WOLF: You come back to that 1988 law repeatedly in the book. I wonder what you think Congress should do now to change the court. There are proposals to change the number of justices, to change the terms of justices. What would be your prescription?VLADECK: My prescription is sort of even sillier, which is I would just start by doing something. To me, the problem is that Congress has gotten completely out of the business of exercising any leverage over the courts, so much so that when Chief Justice Roberts was invited to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he responds and says that would raise the separation of powers concern.No it wouldn’t! Justices testify all the time. Or at least they did historically, and no one ever thought that was unconstitutional.There are specific things Congress can do, but the real thing Congress needs to do is just more than nothing. Exercise more control over the court’s docket. Use the budget, if necessary, as a cudgel.If nationwide injunctions are a problem that’s responsible for why the court is behaving in this way, make it easier for parties to appeal nationwide injunctions directly to the court without having to go through the emergency application process.There are so many things Congress could do. The problem is that we’re stuck in this post-1988 mindset that it is not Congress’ job. When we look at the court today, we look at the ethics issues, the docket issues, the legitimacy debates – a lot of what’s going on here is a court that’s just not remotely checked and not worrying about being checked.And this is why I’m a bit more circumspect about adding seats to the court or term limits. I don’t think changing the composition of the court changes the basic problem, which is the power dynamic, the Madisonian idea in Federalist 51, that ambition must be made to counteract ambition.That doesn’t change just because you have different bodies in those seats. The way that changes is Congress reasserts its clear constitutional prerogatives over the court. And that’s part of the story the book tries to tell.WOLF: You also talked quite a bit about this idea that the court gets most of its power from the legitimacy it has in the public. What should it do to restore its legitimacy?VLADECK: “Restore” is a little strong. I have not given up on the court. But I think there’s a lot that the justices can do to at least give a sense that they actually care about public perception, and that they should care about public perception.First, I think it would be nice if the justices would stop attacking critics as seeking to delegitimize the court. If you think the criticisms are unfair, then respond on the substance as opposed to attacking the people who are criticizing.When it comes to the shadow docket specifically, I think the justices can commit internally to norms about writings providing some rationale whenever the court’s going to grant emergency relief and actually upset the status quo.I think the court can commit to taking pains to make sure in each case that it’s explaining how the relevant criteria for emergency relief are met, that it’s explaining why it disagrees with lower courts, who in many cases are writing lengthy opinions that are getting quashed in a sentence.More generally, the justices could emulate better behavior when it comes to emergency applications and what the court’s role is in responding to them.",politics,0.0
787,813,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/uk-storm-shadow-cruise-missiles-ukraine/index.html,"Britain has delivered long-range ‘Storm Shadow’ cruise missiles to Ukraine ahead of expected counteroffensive, sources say",2023-05-12 05:19:00,"The United Kingdom has delivered multiple “Storm Shadow” cruise missiles to Ukraine, giving the nation a new long-range strike capability in advance of a highly anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces, multiple senior Western officials told CNN.UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace, calling the donation Ukraine’s “best chance to defend themselves against Russia’s continued brutality,” confirmed the transaction on Thursday after CNN exclusively reported the deal.The Storm Shadow is a long-range cruise missile with stealth capabilities, jointly developed by the UK and France, which is typically launched from the air. With a firing range in excess of 250km, or 155 miles, it is just short of the 185-mile range capability of the US-made surface-to-surface Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, that Ukraine has long asked for.Critically, the Storm Shadow has the range to strike deep into Russian-held territory in Eastern Ukraine. A Western official told CNN that the UK has received assurances from the Ukrainian government that these missiles will be used only within Ukrainian sovereign territory and not inside Russia. UK officials have made frequent public statements identifying Crimea as Ukrainian sovereign territory, describing it as “illegally annexed.”The missile is “a real game changer from a range perspective,” a senior US military official told CNN and gives Kyiv a capability it has been requesting since the outset of the war.  As CNN has reported, Ukraine’s current maximum range on US-provided weapons is around 49 miles.The deployment of the missiles comes as Ukrainian forces prepare to launch a counteroffensive intended to retake Kremlin-held territory in the eastern and the southern parts of the country.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country still needs “a bit more time” before it launches the counteroffensive, in order to allow some more of the promised Western military aid to arrive in country.“With [what we have] we can go forward and be successful,” Zelensky told European public service broadcasters in an interview published on Thursday. “But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable.”“So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time,” he added. Among the supplies Ukraine is still waiting for are armored vehicles – including tanks – which Zelensky said were “arriving in batches.”This is not the first time Britain has gone further than the US in the weaponry it has been prepared to send to Ukraine. It was the first ally to announce it was sending modern Western tanks to Ukraine, in January pledging 14 Challenge 2 tanks before the US announced it would contribute M-1 Abrams tanks shortly after.Earlier this year, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak signaled that Britain was considering sending long-range weapons.“We must help Ukraine to shield its cities from Russian bombs and Iranian drones,” Sunak said at the Munich Security Conference on February 18. “And that’s why the UK will be the first country to provide Ukraine with longer-range weapons.”And earlier this month the British government issued a procurement notice through the International Fund for Ukraine. The notice said the UK was inviting expressions of interest for buying “long-range strike” rockets or missiles by May 4, and potential suppliers would be contacted after a month. The notice stipulated “missiles or rockets with a range 100-300km; land, sea or air launch. Payload 20-490kg.”US officials have repeatedly emphasized that they will continue supporting Ukraine for “as long as it takes”, and while tens of billions of dollars’ worth of equipment have been provided, the embattled country has continued asking for more to defeat the Russian military, including longer-range missiles such as ATACMS.However, the US has been cautious over the last year in providing weapons to Ukraine that could help them strike within Russian territory. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters in August that it is the US assessment Ukraine does not “currently require ATACMS to service targets that are directly relevant to the current fight.”According to MBDA Missile Systems, the European company which manufactures the missile, the Storm Shadow is a “deep strike weapon” capable of “being operated day and night in all weathers,” that features an advanced navigation system to ensure accuracy.“After launch, the weapon descends to terrain hugging altitude to avoid detection,” MBDA’s website states. “On approaching the target, its onboard infrared seeker matches the target image with the stored picture to ensure a precision strike and minimal collateral damage.”This story has been updated with additional details.",world,0.0
796,822,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/biden-second-white-house-meeting-debt-limit-postponed/index.html,Biden’s second debt limit meeting with congressional leaders postponed,2023-05-11 18:44:00,"President Joe Biden’s anticipated meeting originally scheduled for Friday with congressional leaders aimed at discussing a deal to avert a default on the national debt has been postponed, a White House spokesperson said.Friday’s meeting would have been the second time in less than a week that congressional leaders met with Biden at the White House in an effort to reach a solution to avoid default. Instead, the spokesperson told CNN on Thursday, staff will continue to meet and the leaders will come together again next week.“I don’t think there’s enough progress for the leaders to get back together,” McCarthy said on Thursday, adding that he expects a meeting on debt limit next week with the four congressional leaders and the White House.“The White House didn’t cancel the meeting – all of the leaders decided it’s probably in the best of our interest to let the staff meet again before we get back together,” McCarthy said.A source familiar with the meetings insisted the delay was a “positive development” and that “meetings are progressing.”White House officials and aides to McCarthy and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries all thought postponing the meeting was a good idea, according to another source familiar with the negotiations. The general consensus, they said, is that allowing more time for staff-level talks will ensure the leaders’ meeting would be “more productive.”In a sign of contention, however, McCarthy slammed the “seriousness” of the White House in debt negotiations on Thursday, saying, “it seems like they want a default.”The ongoing conversations between the two federal branches come at a critical moment.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the United States could default on its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t find a solution addressing the debt limit. And McCarthy has said Congress will need to reach a deal in principle by next week in order to move the deal through the gears of Congress ahead of that potential default deadline.After an initial meeting on Tuesday in the Oval Office, those involved acknowledged that a concrete path forward to avoid default had not been secured.Staff for each of the offices involved have met daily since Tuesday’s meeting, relaying areas they see as red lines for each of their parties.House Republicans have wanted to attach spending reductions to a debt ceiling increase and have passed a debt limit plan that does just that. But Biden and congressional Democrats have insisted on passing a clean increase on the debt limit before addressing a framework for spending.But even as the president continues to insist he will not negotiate over raising the debt ceiling, he has said he is willing to negotiate spending levels and his staff is now racing to reach a spending agreement with Republicans before the US faces default as early as June 1.The White House has conveyed to congressional negotiators that Biden’s most recent legislative accomplishment, the Inflation Reduction Act, is off the table as the two sides begin to eye potential spending cuts, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The law, which makes historic investments in combating climate change, was targeted as part of House Republicans’ bill to cut spending alongside a debt ceiling increase.Among the White House’s other non-starter items: rolling back student debt forgiveness – a key campaign promise that remains tied up in litigation that was also targeted in House Republicans’ bill last month – and Medicaid and SNAP benefits.Inside the West Wing, there is a growing acknowledgment that the White House will have to accept spending cuts, even as the president argues the spending negotiations are not linked to raising the debt ceiling.And negotiators are also beginning to discuss permitting reform, which could be a part of an eventual deal, two sources said.Sources familiar with the matter said the White House is willing to entertain a cap on future spending, but for a far shorter period of time than the 10-year spending cuts agreed to as part of the 2011 debt ceiling standoff.And in early conversations, White House officials have also indicated a debt ceiling increase will need to last more than the one year, to avoid this scenario playing out again next year.Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, who is helping lead GOP negotiations on the debt ceiling, on Thursday outlined four areas where he thinks there could be agreement: permitting reform, clawing back unspent Covid relief funds, work requirements and spending caps.Graves acknowledged that the White House indicated they “don’t like”  repealing any portions of the IRA. On the length of the debt ceiling hike, Graves signaled that Republicans would be open to a two-year hike but said that would require the White House to put “more savings on the table.”While Biden had suggested earlier this week that he’d be open to a short-term extension, Graves ruled out the idea, saying, “As far as we’re concerned right now, it’s absolutely off the table.”",politics,0.0

An ironic twist on the House floor occurred when now-indicted New York Republican Rep. George Santos, who has been accused of committing this same fraud, voted for the bill. Santos was also a co-sponsor of the legislation.Santos was indicted this week on 13 federal charges, including fraudulently receiving nearly $25,000 in unemployment benefits. Santos has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and vowed to not only fight the case against him, but continue to serve and vote in the House chamber.The New York Republican is accused of fraudulently applying for unemployment benefits, with the indictment alleging he falsely claimed to be unemployed in an application for a pandemic-related unemployment insurance program.Santos hastily exited the Capitol after votes, saying he had no doubts about voting for the unemployment benefits bill he co-sponsored.“No, not at all,” he said when asked if he had second thoughts about voting for it given the charges of unemployment fraud against him.“Because the allegations are that I took two weeks over that I was entitled to unemployment. We are looking into it. It’s a little over one thousand dollars. I have no problem making that restitution,” he added.In his brief moments in the chamber, Santos spoke to no other members. He kept his head down, voted at the electronic vote slot located in the last row, and immediately returned to the cloakroom.",politics,0.0

Jean Carroll civil suit,2023-05-11 17:43:00,"Former President Donald Trump is appealing the $5 million judgment awarded by the Manhattan federal jury that found he sexually abused and defamed former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.Trump’s lawyers filed the notice of appeal in the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, hours after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan filed a written ruling endorsing the jury verdict and ordering Trump to pay Carroll the full sum. Kaplan presided over the civil trial in New York.Trump had previously indicated he planned to appeal.Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York in the spring of 1996 and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book.The jury found him liable for battery based on the sexual assault claim, that he should pay about $2 million in damages to Carroll for the civil battery claim and that he should pay her nearly $3 million in damages for successfully proving her defamation claim against him.While the jury found that Trump sexually abused her, sufficient to hold him liable for battery, the jury did not find that Carroll proved he raped her.Trump denied all claims brought against him by Carroll and called the civil trial verdict “a total disgrace.”Like any defendant in a civil case, Trump was not required to appear in court for trial or any proceedings and had a right not to testify in his own defense. He did not attend the trial, and his team contended the former president couldn’t get a fair trial in New York City.During the trial, Carroll acknowledged she is a registered Democrat and thinks Trump was a terrible president, but testified that her political views have nothing to do with her case.“I’m not settling a political score,” Carroll testified. “I’m settling a personal score because he called me a liar repeatedly and it really has decimated my reputation. I’m a journalist – the one thing I have to have is the trust of the readers.”Trump’s lawyer, in his closing argument earlier this week, told jurors he knew Trump was a divisive figure, but told them that shouldn’t matter when reaching a verdict.“People have very strong feelings about Donald Trump. That’s obvious,” attorney Joe Tacopina said. “There’s a time and a secret place to do that: it’s called a ballot box during an election.”The verdict has no legal effect on Trump’s presidential candidacy. The former president denied the accusations and made dismissive comments about Carroll a little more than 24 hours after the jury’s finding during a CNN town hall in New Hampshire.This story has been updated with additional details.",politics,0.0

We’re seeking now to move beyond that and reestablish just a standard normal channel of communications,” the official said on a call with reporters after the meeting.“We made clear where we stand in terms of the breach of sovereignty, we’ve been clear on that from the very get go. But again, trying to look forward from here on,” the official added, noting they focused on “how do we manage the other issues that are ongoing right now and manage the tension in the relationship that exists.”The official said that Chinese officials saw the importance of engaging with the US to try to manage the relationship, which the official said was a “departure” from the Chinese statements out of previous US-China engagements.“I think both sides thought it would be useful try to do another conversation of this national security adviser director level,” they said. The last time that officials met at that level was last June.“I think both sides see the value in sort of this low profile channel to handle some of the more complex issues in the bilateral relationships,” the official added.The meeting came together “fairly quickly,” the official said, and lasted eight hours over the course of two days in Vienna. It was one of the more constructive meetings they had participated in, the official told reporters.Sullivan told Wang that the US and China are competitors but that the US “does not seek conflict or confrontation.”He raised the cases of three wrongfully detained American citizens – Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and David Lin. The two sides also discussed the issue of counternarcotics.The official said they did not get into specifics about rescheduling Blinken’s trip to Beijing, but they “do anticipate there’ll be engagements … in both directions over the coming months.”They also did not get into specifics about scheduling for a call between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, “but I think both sides recognize the importance of leader level communication,” the official said.Blinken was due to travel to China in early February, but the trip was postponed in response to the Chinese surveillance balloon traversing the United States.The top US diplomat said that balloon’s presence over the US “created the conditions that undermine the purpose of the trip.”In February, weeks after the balloon incident, Blinken met with Wang on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.In that meeting, Blinken “directly spoke to the unacceptable violation of US sovereignty and international law” and said incidents like the balloon, which hovered over US airspace for days before the US shot it down off the coast of South Carolina, “must never occur again,” former State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.Blinken, who a senior State Department official characterized as “very direct and candid throughout,” began the hour long meeting by stating “how unacceptable and irresponsible” it was that China had flown the balloon into US airspace. The secretary later expressed disappointment that Beijing had not engaged in military-to-military dialogue when the Chinese balloon incident occurred, the senior official told reporters.“He stated, candidly stated, our disappointment that in this recent period that our Chinese military counterparts had refused to pick up the phone. We think that’s unfortunate. And that is not the way that our two sides ought to be conducting business,” the official said.In an event in early May, US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said the US was “ready to talk” to China, and expressed hope that Beijing would “meet us halfway on this.”He said the US was ready for “a more broad-based engagement at the cabinet level,” adding, “we have never supported an icing of this relationship.”",politics,0.0
800,826,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/epa-power-plant-rules-climate/index.html,EPA proposes new rules that would dramatically slash planet-warming pollution from power plants,2023-05-11 17:28:00,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday proposed one of its most highly anticipated climate rules to date, compelling nearly all US power plants that generate the nation’s electricity to capture or otherwise slash their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions.The rules would apply to the nation’s fleet of existing and new power plants that run on coal and natural gas – two major fossil fuels, which are the root cause of the climate crisis. The Biden administration’s proposal would push utilities to outfit many power plants with costly carbon capture technology or add clean hydrogen fuel to reduce their emissions.Unlike the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which faced fierce opposition that rose to the Supreme Court, the proposed rules will leave it to individual utilities to choose how to meet the emissions standards – which will ultimately be implemented and enforced by individual states, EPA officials said. Some power plants that are slated to close in the next few years may not have to meet the new requirements.Between 2028 and 2042, the EPA estimated the rules would cut about 617 million metric tons of carbon pollution from existing coal and new gas plants. In addition, the agency estimates the rules will cut between 214 and 407 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from existing gas plants.EPA and White House officials said the proposed rules would help meet President Joe Biden’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035, while only marginally raising costs for the nation’s ratepayers. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said his agency estimated that while baseline electricity costs would go up 2% by 2030, they would rise just 0.08% further by 2040.“We believe that where we will end up will be squarely in line with the president’s goal,” Regan told reporters. “We’re looking at a negligible impact on electricity prices, while yielding climate and public health benefits that far exceed those costs.”Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Biden said the new EPA rules proposal “kicks off a public commitment to engage with labor and industry and environmentalists and other experts to make sure we make a major step forward in the climate crisis, protecting public health.”Combined with a larger suite of regulations aimed at cutting pollution from oil and gas, vehicles, refrigerants, the new rules that the EPA has put forth in the past few years could save up to 15 billion metric tons of plant-warming pollution, Regan said.Much of that comes from the administration’s recent proposals to cut vehicle emissions, but the clean power plant rules are critical. The power sector makes up a quarter of overall US emissions, but it holds outsized importance since it will provide power for electric vehicles and help decarbonize heavy industry.“Getting carbon pollution out of the power sector is the lynchpin by which we tackle carbon pollution throughout the rest of the economy,” Sam Ricketts, a former adviser to Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee who now works with Evergreen Action and the Center for American Progress, told CNN.The rule will likely face new legal challenges and political headaches. But Regan said the new power plant rules “would bring us one step closer in our mission to safeguard the air our children breathe.”The Obama-era Clean Power Plan focused on getting power plants to change how they generated electricity, and ultimately was blocked by Supreme Court. But the Biden EPA’s proposal focuses on outfitting existing plants with technology to capture pollution before it escapes into the air, and it gives utilities the ability to choose how they meet the new standard.The agency is betting that much if this can be done through carbon capture and sequestration: catching carbon pollution at its source, after which it can be stored or reused. According to the EPA rules, carbon capture would be used for baseload power plants that generate a lot of electricity and expect to have a long life – operating after the year 2040.For plants that generate less electricity, or ones that are shutting down earlier, the rules would be different. For instance, some categories of plants could add clean hydrogen to the mix – starting at 30% clean hydrogen early in the 2030s and ramping up to over 90% clean hydrogen by the end of the decade.“Each power plant is going to have its own individual set of circumstances,” Jay Duffy, an attorney and expert on power plant emissions at nonpartisan group Clean Air Task Force, told CNN. “Some of them may already be old and marginal, and it might make more sense for them to not make some big pollution control investment later in their life.”Many of the proposed rules would go into effect years from now – a recognition from the EPA that much of this technology isn’t in wide use yet.Carbon capture has traditionally been quite expensive to add to power plants, causing some utilities to choose to shut plants down and replace them with cheaper, renewable energy like solar or wind.  However, the Inflation Reduction Act came with significant subsidies for carbon capture to make the technology cheaper and on par with other technologies that can cut emissions.“Essentially, the costs of (carbon capture) are minimal” and comparable to other technologies given the tax credits in the IRA, Duffy said.Still, a utility industry source said that even if IRA subsidies bring the costs down, there’s no escaping the fact that there’s little existing pipeline and storage infrastructure for captured carbon in the US. Clean hydrogen projects are similarly nascent, the source said.But others said the long timelines and some flexibility for industry in EPA’s proposed rule is a recognition of that.“They’re trying to phase it in over time,” Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental & Energy Law Program, told CNN. “I’m sure they’re considering the infrastructure that’s needed.”Regan told reporters that some plants would shut down, though didn’t offer a precise number.“The short answer is yes, we will see some retirements within the system,” Regan said. “But this is really a decision that will be made state by state, company by company.”The new EPA rules landed with immediate criticism from lawmakers and officials in a coal-heavy state.Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has already vowed to oppose any future EPA nominee in the Senate over the rule. Meanwhile, Manchin’s Republican colleague Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia called it an attempt to “kill American energy jobs” and vowed to introduce a Congressional Review Act bill to attempt to overturn it.And though the EPA’s regulatory ability survived one Supreme Court challenge last year, it could face new attempts to squash it. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey suggested the rules were headed for a court battle.“Based upon what we currently know about this proposal, it is not going to be upheld, and it just seems designed to scare more coal-fired power plants into retirement — the goal of the Biden administration,” Morrisey, a Republican, said in a statement. “That tactic is unacceptable, and this rule appears to utterly fly in the face of the rule of law. The U.S. Supreme Court has placed significant limits on what the EPA can do — we plan on ensuring that those limits are upheld, and we expect that we would once again prevail in court against this out-of-control agency.”Still, administration officials and advocates underscored they believed the rule comports with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in West Virginia v. EPA and is one that will survive future legal challenges.“I have confidence in its durability,” Ricketts said. “The EPA has learned the lessons. … I think they’re operating tightly in the bounds of what the Clean Air Act and Supreme Court allow.”While Duffy said it would be no surprise if the new rules were challenged in the courts, he added that he “wouldn’t expect this rule to present the same sort of big legal questions that the Supreme Court usually takes up.”Regan announced the new proposed rules on Thursday at the University of Maryland where he spoke directly to young voters about the Biden administration’s climate goals.The slate of EPA rules combating pollution, Regan said, made him “optimistic about what’s possible for the future of our nation.”This story has been updated with more information.",politics,0.0

The goal of staff-level talks, the sources said is more clearly define the contours of spending negotiation.On Thursday afternoon a White House spokesperson said a meeting planned for Friday between Biden and congressional leaders had been postponed.“Staff will continue working and all the principals agreed to meet early next week,” the spokesperson said.A source familiar with the meetings said, “It wasn’t the right moment to bring it back to principals.”The first stage of negotiations began with Biden’s meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday – where officials said the IRA was off the table – and continued Wednesday with a two-hour staff-level meeting at the White House, during which both sides began to draw battle lines and convey their starting positions for the multi-round negotiations to follow.Among the White House’s other non-starter items: rolling back student debt forgiveness, a key campaign promise that remains tied up in litigation that was also targeted in House Republicans’ bill last month, and Medicaid and SNAP benefitsA source familiar with the negotiations said White House officials raised all of those items in Wednesday’s meeting, calling them priorities the White House would not see cut.Even as Biden continues to insist he will not negotiate over raising the debt ceiling, he has said he is willing to negotiate spending levels and his staff is now racing to reach a spending agreement with Republicans before the US faces default as early as June 1.As part of those negotiations, sources familiar with the matter said the White House is willing to entertain a cap on future spending, but for a far shorter period of time than the 10-year spending cuts agreed to as part of the 2011 debt ceiling standoff.And in early conversations, White House officials have also indicated a debt ceiling increase will need to last more than the one year, to avoid this scenario playing out again next year.White House and congressional leadership staff met again on Thursday and the decision was made to continue staff level talks before Biden and congressional leaders meet again sometime next week.Asked by CNN whether Wednesday’s staff-level talks brought the two sides any closer to reaching a deal, McCarthy said, “No.”“I don’t see much of a difference right now,” McCarthy said.Emerging from Tuesday’s meeting in which no substantive progress was made, Biden has said he sees those staff-level meetings as the path to reaching a deal.“One of the ways in which senators or congresspersons are able to back off some of the things they’ve done is if they give their staff some leeway, and the staff has then said, ‘Well, we’re going to do this,’” Biden said. “And it moves.”Inside the West Wing, there is a growing acknowledgment that the White House will have to accept spending cuts, even as the president argues the spending negotiations are not linked to raising the debt ceiling.And negotiators are also beginning to discuss permitting reform, which could be a part of an eventual deal, two sources said.As for how to cut spending, the White House is eyeing measures like expanding Medicare’s ability to negotiate drug prices and clawing back unspent Covid relief funds, which Biden said is “on the table.”Those ideas are a far-cry from the sweeping cuts House Republicans are seeking and it remains unclear where the White House is willing to compromise on steeper cuts.It also remains unclear what type of compromise McCarthy will be able to sell to his caucus, where hardline conservatives outnumber his slim four-seat majority – and whether he will be willing to agree to a deal that requires Democratic votes to pass.McCarthy has said he believes a deal must be hammered out by next week to be able to go through the gears of Congress ahead of the potential June 1 default deadline.Biden demurred when asked Wednesday about McCarthy’s deadline, saying he was “not going to make those kinds of judgments.”“I’ve been involved in negotiations my whole career,” he told CNN. “Some negotiations happen at the last second, some negotiations happen way ahead of time. So, we’ll see.”",politics,0.0

George Santos has signed a deal with Brazilian authorities to avoid prosecution in lieu of a confession, reimbursement for the victim and a fine to the state stemming from a 2008 fraud case, his attorney said.“From now on, he is not answering to any lawsuits in Brazil,” his attorney Jonymar Vasconcelos said at the Niterói courthouse outside Rio de Janeiro.Documents obtained by CNN in January showed Santos, a New York Republican, confessed to defrauding a Rio de Janeiro area clerk of $1,300 over clothes and shoes in 2008.Santos will pay a total of approximately $4,878.45. Of this amount, approximately $2,000 will go to the government as a fine and $2,800 to the victim, Bruno Simões, who told reporters that Santos has 30 days to make the payment via bank transfer. Simões told CNN that the government’s share of the payment will go to charity.Santos appeared via video conference, and according to Simões, the judge unmuted Santos and asked if he confessed to the crimes described in the case, to which Santos replied he did.“It’s ridiculous. It’s a bargain, the guy paid $500,00 dollars in bail,” Simões told CNN after the hearing, referring to Santos’ criminal case in the US. The congressman on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to 13 US federal charges, including money laundering, wire fraud, theft of public funds and lying to the House of Representatives.“Honestly, he must have laughed. Because 14,000 Brazilian Reais is $2,000 – that’s one suit that he wears. But despite it all, I am happy that this chapter is closed,” Simões said.A source familiar with the case and Rio de Janeiro state law said the fine was more than seven times the average amount charged in fines for similar cases.In January, Santos’ attorney requested the deal in a petition that said Santos would agree to formally confess to the crime and pay damages to the victim as is required under Brazilian law in order to avoid prosecution.A memo from Brazilian prosecutors agreeing to the deal in March asked the defense for assurances that they have the ability to contact the victim to repay him before the deal is finalized.In a statement to CNN in March, the prosecutors’ office acknowledged the memo but stressed that the deal is not final until all conditions are met.The case is under gag order.This story has been updated with additional developments.",politics,0.0

But it will serve as a messaging opportunity for the House Republican majority on one of their signature priorities. Final passage was been planned to coincide with the expiration of Title 42, a pandemic-era policy that allowed certain migrants to be turned away at the border.The vote was 219 to 213, with Republican Reps. Thomas Massie and John Duarte breaking ranks to vote no.The bill would restart construction of a border wall, increase funding for border agents and upgraded border technology, reinstate the “remain in Mexico” policy, place new restrictions on asylum seekers, and enhance requirements for E-verify, a database employers use to verify immigration status.Republican leaders worked for months to negotiate the border and immigration package, a key piece of legislation for the GOP majority focused on an issue Republican lawmakers ran on in the midterms. But crafting immigration policy has proven complicated for House Republicans, exposing divisions within the GOP conference.Thursday’s vote took place after House GOP leaders agreed to make last-minute changes to the package amid concerns over various provisions from some of their members.One issue had been over language that asks the secretary of homeland security to issue a report determining whether Mexican cartels are a “foreign terrorist organization.” Some Republicans pushed leadership to take it out of the bill, concerned it could create a new “credible fear” claim for asylum seekers.On Wednesday, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds confirmed that leaders would be tweaking the bill to address members’ concern, including an amendment to change the foreign terrorist organization language.There were also concerns over a provision in the bill to expand E-verify with some Republicans worried that without reworking the agricultural visa program, the provision could make it more difficult for rural farmers to find a pipeline of workers.Rep. Dan Newhouse, in a tweet on Wednesday, said that leadership had committed to addressing concerns raised over E-verify in the package, and he said he would support the package as a result of those assurances.The Biden administration’s veto threat against the legislation criticized the measure, saying, “this bill would make things worse, not better.”The measure “does nothing to address the root causes of migration, reduces humanitarian protections, and restricts lawful pathways, which are critical alternatives to unlawful entry … because this bill does very little to actually increase border security while doing a great deal to trample on the nation’s core values and international obligations, it should be rejected,” the statement said.",politics,0.0

She is a psychologist who previously oversaw a similar program for the Navy and has worked in victim advocacy, sexual assault response and prevention, and program development for over 18 years, Burns said in the statement.CIA is also establishing an internal task force to help address some of the problems with its reporting structure and process, Burns added.One short term goal for the CIA is to address how leadership communicates with its workforce about sexual assault and harassment, according to the senior CIA official.That includes making clear to CIA employees that there are no barriers for reporting sexual assault to law enforcement, the senior official added.“We assist officers who report concerns on how to do that,” the official said, adding that even if CIA employees go to law enforcement, which they are encouraged to do, without consulting the agency first, senior officials will still help them navigate the process.Officers serving overseas should report any sexual assault or harassment to their local supervisor, the senior official added.Despite the new steps announced Thursday, there are lingering questions as to why it has taken the CIA so long to address these problems, particularly when other federal agencies have made strides to do so.And the agency now faces the investigation by its inspector general, who is tasked with conducting independent oversight of the CIA.As part of the probe, the IG will investigate the CIA’s adherence to applicable laws and regulations to ensure a safe workplace, the official from the inspector general’s office told CNN on Thursday.They will also examine the roles and responsibilities of agency components in preventing and responding to allegations of sexual assault and harassment, the official added.Allegations that the CIA mishandled sexual assault and harassment cases has also caught the attention of Congress.The Senate Intelligence Committee requested an investigation by the OIG after it was notified “of a number of allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment … that are alleged to have been grossly mishandled by the CIA.”“We respectfully request that you examine and investigate the roles and responsibilities of all Agency components in preventing – and responding to allegations of – sexual assault or harassment among Agency personnel,” a letter sent to the IG by the panel said.“We further request that you consider the extent to which the law or Agency regulations, guidance, protocols, or practice present obstacles to the administration of justice under the law or in Agency personnel decisions and make recommended changes that would remove any identified barriers to achieving just results in cases of sexual assault or sexual harassment,” it added.The House Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, has said it is conducting its own investigation into the CIA’s handling of sexual assault and harassment cases.CNN previously reported that the House panel has heard from multiple female CIA employees since the beginning of this year and told lawmakers the agency is discouraging women from filing sexual misconduct complaints.",politics,0.0
812,838,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/business/stores-closing-cities-downtown-retail/index.html,The real reasons stores such as Walmart and Starbucks are closing in big cities,2023-05-13 16:58:00,"Nordstrom. Walmart. Whole Foods. Starbucks. CVS.These big chains and others have closed stores in major US cities recently, raising alarm about the future of retail in some of the country’s most prominent downtowns and business districts.Several forces are pushing chains out of some city centers: a glut of stores, people working from home, online shopping, exorbitant rents, crime and public safety concerns, and difficulty hiring workers.To reinvent downtown retail, drastic changes may be required.That means denser neighborhoods with a broader mix of affordable housing, experiential retail, restaurants, entertainment, parks and other amenities, which won’t happen overnight.“Once [these cities] become true urban neighborhoods, then you will find retailing start to come back in different ways and forms,” said Terry Shook, a founding partner at consulting firm Shook Kelly.How policymakers remake their downtowns — with retail as a crucial attraction — will be crucial to cities’ fiscal health and regional economies.Some of those policymakers, including both Republican and Democratic leaders, have pointed to crime as a chief reason for the closures, following videos of brazen shoplifting incidents.“We’re losing chain stores that are closing down. People who are being employed in those stores are losing their jobs” because of crime, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said in February.But the impact of shoplifting may have been overstated in some cases.Walgreens said it saw a spike in losses, known as shrink, during the pandemic and cited organized retail crime in its decision to close five San Francisco stores in 2021. But it recently backtracked.“Maybe we cried too much last year” about shrink numbers, a Walgreens executive said in January.And instead of a strong correlation with crime rates, the closures aren’t also a recent phenomenon.San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, Seattle, Miami and Chicago lost retail stores from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021, according to research from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, a think tank.What’s more, experts agree, the closures aren’t just about crime. Several trends have converged to put these stores at risk.Perhaps most key is the glut of stores in America.According to Morgan Stanley, from 1995 to 2021, more stores closed every year than opened. The trend became popularized as the “retail apocalypse.”So while the big-city closures may capture national attention, in reality they’re often part of closures a brand implements across the nation.“The logic of big box retail, period, is much weaker than it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago,” said David Dixon, an urban places fellow at Stantec, a global design firm.For example, Walmart has shuttered about 40 stores since 2021 and will close 20 this year. Nordstrom will shut down 15 locations in 2023.CVS also announced in 2021 that it will close 900 stores over three years.Even at stores still in city centers, fewer people are often shopping.One major factor here is the pandemic-fueled shift to remote work: Between 2019 and 2021, the number of people primarily working from home tripled from around 9 million people to 27.6 million people, according to the Census Bureau.The rise of remote work has damaged urban downtown shopping areas, which were designed to cater to office workers commuting back and forth daily.The typical office worker is now spending about $2,000 to $4,600 less per year in city centers, according to research from Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economist.They’re shifting that spending to the suburbs, as 1 million people also left city centers during the pandemic, he said.Retailers have followed this shift.They left more expensive cities like San Francisco and New York and headed to cheaper Sun Belt cities such as Phoenix and Houston, the JPMorgan Chase Institute found.San Francisco lost around 6% of its retail establishments from 2019 to 2021, according to the think tank’s research. Los Angeles lost around 4% and New York shed 3%.Meanwhile, Houston and Phoenix gained 4% new retail establishments during that stretch.Retail stores are also under pressure from the continued shift to online shopping.E-commerce made up 14.7% of all retail sales during the final quarter of 2022, according to the Census Bureau. The pandemic accelerated that growth.For example, chain-store closures in New York City have correlated to the products most frequently bought online. Clothing, shoes, accessories, vitamins and electronics stores have fared the worst, said Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a public policy think tank.And though crime isn’t the biggest factor in many cases, higher levels of shoplifting and other losses have taken some toll.Retail shrink hit $94.5 billion in 2021, a 53% jump from 2019, according to the National Retail Federation’s annual survey of around 60 retail member companies. (The largest contributor to shrink is customer theft, but the metric also includes employee theft, human errors, and other losses.)Finally, struggles to recruit workers at higher wages and punishing rents in cities have contributed to retail closings.In San Francisco, the average rental price listed by landlords during the first quarter of 2023 was $43 per square foot, nearly double the national average, according to Cushman & Wakefield data. In New York, it was $32 per square foot and $33 in Los Angeles.In cities where retailers are growing, such Phoenix, Houston and Dallas, average rental prices were $22 and $23 per square foot.There’s no easy fix to slow the exodus of retail chains from cities.Replacing a Nordstrom with another department store, or swapping out a CVS for a different drug store chain, is unlikely to be sustainable, experts say.“It’s a really tough problem for cities and economic developers,” said Chris Wheat, the president of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “How do you make these live, work and play neighborhoods? That was a question before the pandemic, but it’s become more salient now.”It hearkens back to urbanist Jane Jacobs’ influential 1958 essay “Downtown is for People,” in which she argued a vibrant street life was crucial for neighborhood safety and community.It is this model, focused on the vitality of the streets and the people who inhabit them, that’s needed to create lively and exciting communities and shopping areas.Streets could be blocked to cars on weekends and other hours. Cities can also host street fairs, food festivals, live music, art exhibits and other events to draw foot traffic downtown.These so-called “placemaking” investments —which Bowles notes are “not massive, billion-dollar” invesments — could be supported by special business improvement districts, where local stakeholders fund the maintenance and promotion of the area.If the future of shopping is not giant department stores, a wider mix of stores will be needed to make downtowns more appealing.Traditionally, retail landlords seek out the longest leases. But that makes it difficult for new stores to open.Cities can provide financial incentives to encourage landlords to offer temporary and more flexible leases and loosen regulations to speed up the permitting process for them.This will allow for pop-up stores, seasonal retailers and a mix of food and drink vendors.“Can retail be more responsive?” said Paco Underhill, the founder of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. “Can you have a space that is Crocs during summer and Canada Goose during winter?”Then there are more intractable challenges, such as improving public transit and creating more affordable housing in downtown areas.Zoning laws need to be updated to allow for redevelopment of some vacant office buildings and commercial real estate into affordable housing.The density of housing that will replace some office and commercial spaces matters, said David Dixon from Stantec. People want to shop just minutes from their homes, and a critical mass of housing is needed to sustain surrounding retailers.“A vibrant downtown, full of housing, can bring its streets to life,” he said. “It’s a much larger story than the fate of retailers themselves.”",business,0.0

Painting a picture of the company’s early days in 2018, he claimed ByteDance would take videos from its competitors and use them to populate its own video services.The former employee alleged in the complaint he was “troubled by ByteDance’s efforts to skirt legal and ethical lines.”The allegations come as the wildly popular TikTok app is at risk of being banned by US lawmakers for national security concerns. Montana lawmakers voted to completely ban TikTok in the state a few weeks after CEO Shou Zi Chew spent hours testifying before Congress. And the Biden administration has threatened TikTok with a nationwide ban unless its Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company, spelling out an increasingly tense relationship between the two countries.However, security experts say there is still no public evidence the Chinese government has actually spied on people through TikTok, which doesn’t operate in China.“It’s not that we know TikTok has done something, it’s that distrust of China and awareness of Chinese espionage has increased,” said James Lewis, an information security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Yu says he raised concerns about intellectual property with Wenjia Zhu, who was then the senior vice president of engineering.“When informed of Mr. Yu’s concerns with the program, Mr. Zhu was dismissive of them, and the intellectual property infringement continued unabated,” the complaint said.Charles Jung, attorney for Yu, said the former employee is the most senior executive to come forward publicly.“Tech companies in his view should be run in an ethical and responsible way,” Jung said in a statement to CNN. “My client is concerned about protecting American user data, the ethical operation of the app, and the wellbeing of ByteDance’s employees.”In a statement to CNN, a ByteDance spokesperson said the company is “committed to respecting the intellectual property of other companies, and we acquire data in accordance with industry practices and our global policy.”Yu is seeking compensatory damages such as lost earnings, injunctive relief and liquidated and punitive damages.A ByteDance spokesperson said that Yu worked on an app called Flipagram while at the company, which was discontinued due to business reasons.“We plan to vigorously oppose what we believe are baseless claims and allegations in this complaint,” the spokesperson said. “Mr. Yu worked for ByteDance Inc. for less than a year and his employment ended in July 2018,” which Yu disputed in his complaint.",business,0.0

Backers of the game and developers are desperate to find vacant spaces to build courts.Pickleball, which combines elements of tennis, badminton and ping-pong, began in 1965. But it has skyrocketed during the pandemic.The number of people playing pickleball grew by 159% over three years to 8.9 million in 2022, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, a trade group.Courts have been opening at recreation centers, hotels and retirement communities.However, pickleball’s rapid spread has created dilemmas for public parks and recreation departments, which must balance competing interests with often limited space and funds. Retirement communities and country clubs also face challenges building space for people who enjoy the game without antagonizing others.Some tennis players and neighbors are bothered by the pop-pop-pop noise of pickleball and have blocked the development of courts.So pickleball is heading to malls, where players can play and then grab a bite to eat or do some shopping, landlords hope.A group called Pickleball America is taking over an 80,000 square-foot anchor space in Stamford, Connecticut, in a former two-story Saks Off 5th retail store this summer. It’s set to become one of the largest indoor pickleball venues in the United States.The Meadows at Lake Saint Louis, an outdoor mall, plans to fill the space once occupied by Bed Bath & Beyond with a pickleball club.A pickleball facility recently opened in a former Burlington store space at Shore Mall in New Jersey, and a pickleball club took over an Old Navy space at a New Hampshire mall.And the first Camp Pickle, a new chain that pairs pickleball with food and drink options in a 1940s-era camp culture setting, is set to open next year in Huntsville, Alabama. It will also expand to Atlanta, Dallas and Minneapolis.",business,0.0
815,841,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/business/debt-ceiling-default-economy/index.html,"‘Every family should be concerned’ about debt ceiling, consumer watchdog warns",2023-05-13 14:29:00,"Leaders in Washington are running out of time to avoid an unprecedented default on US debt. The top consumer watchdog in the federal government is warning of dire consequences for American families.“It’s a big worry. Every family should be concerned,” Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CNN in an interview on Thursday.If Congress fails to address the debt ceiling, the federal government could run out of money as soon as June 1, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Friday there is a “significant risk” the federal government will no longer be able to pay all of its obligations during the first two weeks of June.Chopra said a default would cause borrowing costs — including credit card, car loans and mortgage rates — to spike because US debt serves as a critical benchmark for various forms of credit. US Treasuries have long been viewed as risk-free assets, keeping their rates very low.“If global investors do not think that is completely safe, all of us will end up paying for it,” Chopra said.Asked to react to former President Donald Trump dismissing a default as perhaps just a “week or bad day” to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Chopra declined to comment directly on political candidates. But in his response, Chopra made clear he has the exact opposite view.“A lot of things we assume are part of our financial fabric would get ripped away,” Chopra told CNN.He added that the CFPB, a brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren that was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, is “looking very hard” into the impact a default would have on households.Some economists have warned of mass layoffs if the government defaulted. The White House has estimated more than 8 million jobs would get wiped out if there is a protracted default. Moody’s Analytics estimates that states including Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas would lose hundreds of thousands of jobs apiece if there is a prolonged breach of the borrowing limit.“From our own knowledge and oversight of the banking system, we know that everyone is extremely concerned. Corporate America, main street, all of it could be affected,” Chopra said. “The impacts are really quite acute, often for those who can least weather those economic storms.”JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon echoed those concerns, pointing to the risk of mayhem in markets.“The closer you get to it, you will have panic,” Dimon told Bloomberg on Thursday. “Markets will get volatile, maybe the stock market will go down, the Treasury markets will have their own problems … This is not good.”Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been making calls to CEOs and business leaders to discuss the consequences of brinkmanship around the debt ceiling, a person familiar with the matter told CNN earlier this week.The debt ceiling is very likely to be a focus next week when Yellen is scheduled to meet with leading bank CEOs in Washington at a trade association meeting.President Joe Biden briefly commented on the debt ceiling talks as he arrived at Joint Base Andrews Saturday, saying talks are “moving along” but it’s still “hard to tell.”“We’ll know more in the next few days,” he said.“I think they’re moving along, it’s hard to tell. We’ve not reached the crunch point yet, but there’s real discussion … but we’re not there yet,” Biden said.Even though there is still no clear path forward to avoid a default, observers are still cautiously optimistic that Congress will reach a deal, eventually.Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, is encouraged that talks are ongoing and hopeful a bipartisan agreement will emerge soon.“We never expected a deal this week, but we wanted to see real, ongoing discussions and that is what is happening,” Bradley told CNN.Still, as the June 1st deadline approaches, the risk of a genuine crisis is rising.Moody’s Analytics on Wednesday increased its probability of a breach of the debt ceiling to 10%, up from 5% previously.“What once seemed unimaginable now seems a real threat,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi wrote in a report.A breach is not as serious as a default, which would only occur if Treasury failed to make a debt payment on time. A breach, on the other hand, would occur if the federal government fails to make a payment to any creditor on time, whether that be a Social Security recipient or the electric bill on a government building.Financial markets have begun to price in a small — but growing — chance of a disastrous default.The implied probability of a US government default over the next 12 months has roughly doubled since late March to 4.3%, according to modeling by research provider MSCI shared with CNN that is based on the cost to insure US debt in the market for credit default swaps.",business,0.0
816,842,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/business/airbag-inflator-recall-arc/index.html,"US wants a recall of 67 million airbag inflators, but the manufacturer disagrees",2023-05-13 13:06:00,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is calling for an immediate recall of 67 million airbag inflators due to a dangerous defect, the agency said in a letter to ARC Automotive, a major manufacturer of the component. But the automotive supplier that made the component is disputing the need for it to conduct any sort of broad recall at all.NHTSA cited at least nine incidents of airbags manufactured by Knoxville-based ARC Automotive rupturing, leading to significant injuries or even death beginning in 2009. Seven of the nine incidents, including one death, occurred in the United States. The 67 million airbag inflators that NHTSA wants recalled were all produced in the 18-year period prior to January 2018, when ARC installed equipment to help inspect inflators, according to the company.“While incidents are rare, the incidents that have occurred have been severe, prompting the agency to issue a recall request,” Veronica Morales, NHTSA spokesperson, said in a statement. “NHTSA is taking this action under its authorities to investigate potential defects and oversee recalls as required by the Vehicle Safety Act.”ARC disagrees on the need for a recall.“We disagree with NHTSA’s new sweeping request when extensive field testing has found no inherent defect,” an ARC spokesperson said in a statement Saturday.Millions of vehicles with airbags from Takata, the now-bankrupt Japanese manufacturer, are already under recall. NHTSA said that prolonged exposure to high heat and humidity caused those air bags to explode when deployed as well.In comparison to ARC, the Takata airbags caused at least 18 deaths and left more than 400 drivers with injuries that included blinding and maiming. It’s also the largest auto recall in history.The airbag inflators are used by at least 12 vehicle manufacturers, but NHTSA did not specify which ones.In 2021, a driver in a 2015 Chevrolet Traverse died after the airbag inflator ruptured in Michigan. And outside of the United States, a driver in Canada was also killed by a ruptured airbag inflator in a 2009 Hyundai Elantra, according to NHTSA’s letter.“Airbag inflators that project metal fragments into vehicle occupants, rather than properly inflating the attached airbag, create an unreasonable risk of death and injury,” the agency said in the letter.GM said it would recall nearly 1 million cars in the US because the airbag inflator “may explode during deployment, due to a manufacturing defect.”Included in that recall are the Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse, and GMC Acadia vehicles from the 2014 through 2017 model years with modules produced by ARC Automotive. Dealers will replace the airbag module.In a letter dated Thursday in response to NHTSA, ARC vice president for product integrity Steve Gold said the company “strongly disagrees” with the agency’s tentative conclusion that a recall for 67 million airbags is necessary.The letter criticized NHTSA, saying that the agency’s request for a recall was “not based upon any objective technical or engineering conclusion regarding the existence of a defect” and that the “failures were anything other than occasional or isolated.”To support the company’s claims, Gold cited nearly eight years of cooperation with NHTSA on an investigation into ruptured airbag inflators, including tests on 918 inflators pulled out of cars from salvage yards and sent to the company’s labs for testing.“None of the 918 inflators ruptured in the tests,” Gold wrote in response to NHTSA’s request for a recall. “Accordingly, the test program demonstrated with 99% reliability and 99% confidence that the inflators in the subject population would deploy without rupturing.”At least one of the ruptures cited by NHTSA was simply the result of an “isolated manufacturing anomaly,” Gold wrote, and thus a broader recall was unnecessary. And the Canadian incident involving the Hyundai Elantra, Gold added, involved a component that was not used in the US market.Furthermore, “NHTSA’s authority to require certain manufacturers to conduct safety recalls does not extend to manufacturers of original equipment, such as ARC,” Gold wrote in the letter.But Gold went on to write that the company could “understand” that “GM’s action is being taken out of an abundance of caution to address potential concerns about the inflators,” given that three of the incidents involved the Chevy Traverse, specifically.Despite ARC’s protests, NHTSA still wrote that it believes the number of incidents rises to a level where a broad recall is necessary. To support its arguments, it cited seven incidents. One incident was fatal, another resulted in “severe” injuries, and several others result in injuries to the face.- CNN’s Chris Isidore contributed.",business,0.0
817,843,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/business/mothers-day-restaurant-hell/index.html,Why Mother’s Day is the most hated day in the restaurant industry,2023-05-13 10:13:00,"Mother’s Day is one of the busiest days for the American restaurant industry, presenting a massive operational challenge to restaurants. That’s why it gained a reputation among waiters and restaurant staff as one of the most grueling days on the calendar.“Every server knows that working on Mother’s Day is hell. In fact, if I die and go to hell, I completely expect it to be Mother’s Day. 365 days a year,” wrote Darron Cardosa, in his book “The Bitchy Waiter: I’m Really Good at Pretending to Care.”What’s so bad about it? From big groups that show up in waves (“most of us are here!”), to food-fussy kids to splitting the check dramas and coffee-cup lingerers, restaurants hate this holiday. This year is expected to be particularly challenging as high inflation and rising menu prices give some restaurant-goers an extra sense of entitlement.“The anticipation alone can make you anxious,” said Joe Haley, an abstract artist who works as a server at a Quincy, Massachusetts, Italian-American restaurant. It gets “jam-packed. People are calling at the last minute for a reservation, there are other people who made multiple reservations so Mom could have her pick and they never cancel… people who take out their mother once a year tell you ‘Nothing can go wrong!’” he said.But it does. With big tables, a few late arrivals can kick a kitchen into chaos. “And every family has at least one black sheep or in-law who can’t be relied upon to save their lives. Mother’s Day: I dread it,” Haley added.Chefs, servers and owners said that this year guests have set their expectations high: Special occasion meals in a time of rising food prices. In a post-pandemic world, luxury – or rather the appearance of luxury and excess – is “in.” Across the country, customers will get aggravated if their $30 eggs Benedict isn’t dolloped with caviar on Sunday.Tastes have changed, literally, since Covid, said Chef Art Smith, who has been personal chef to Oprah Winfrey and Jeb Bush. He will be serving hundreds of Mother’s Day meals at his four restaurants including his Homecomin’ at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World.The people who visit? “They’re drinking more. They want more carbs – If it’s mac and cheese, it has to be the cheesiest. But they want salads, and they want more veg sides, too. They just want more.”The National Retail Federation forecasts that Mother’s Day spending will reach $35.7 billion this year, with a record $5.6 billion alone spent on a meal or outing, up 6% from last year. It’s the second-busiest day in the restaurant business, eclipsed only by Valentine’s Day, according to online reservations site OpenTable.Mother’s Day presents “an operational challenge,” said Shawn Walchef, owner of five Cali BBQ eateries in the San Diego area. “It’s the busiest day of the year and also the day guests have the highest expectations. He foresees some fuss over tables on the patio – “In Southern California, everyone wants to sit outside.”For many restaurants, this is the first big holiday since 2019 that hasn’t been overshadowed by the pandemic. “It’s a lot of people getting together who haven’t seen each other in a while,” said owner Binh Douglas, who opened Main Prospect in Southampton, New York, about 18 months ago.He expects that guests Sunday will be spending about 40% more than usual, and that a third of the adults will add the $19.95 “bottomless mimosa” to their meal. Fortunately, egg and seafood prices have come down in the last few weeks, he said.But inflation has left its mark on Mother’s Day brunch. At the Breakers in Palm Beach, Mother’s day brunch in The Circle restaurant is $250 per person (up from $160 in 2019) with unlimited Champagne cocktails and a harpist who goes from table to table.At the family-packed McLoone’s Boathouse in West Orange, New Jersey, also home to a waterfront buffet, brunch has gone to $54.95 from $49.95 in 2019.Pricing is touchy. “Your Mother’s Day meal can’t be obnoxiously expensive,” said Derek Axelrod, co-owner of Manhattan’s Upper East Side T bar restaurant. Their Mother’s Day menu will likely be upwards of $100 person, but won’t turn much of a profit, he said. They’re counting on liquor sales to do that. Meanwhile T bar is adding touches like a fois gras, cranberry and chicken parfait to the menu.Servers and owners are also under pressure to “push the lobster.” Seven different restaurants at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas are serving Mother’s Day meals that include lobster (The resort’s round-up of all its Mother’s Day menus notes that a subsequent gondola ride is an additional $39).Ophelia, a rooftop restaurant near the United Nations in New York, solves the “luxury” problem neatly by offering a menu in which Mom gets it all: fried quail egg, lobster, filet mignon, waffles and smoked salmon – but be warned: it’s a $59-per-person presentation of “petite bites.”In Naples, Florida, the hamburger at the Veranda E restaurant on Sunday will be brought under glass, and a cloud of smoke will rise up as it is uncovered. “That’s new for us,” says owner Mary Brandt, who will have four generations of women from her family at the restaurant.To maximize profits and seating, chain restaurants are changing, too. Ruth’s Chris Steak House, which has locations in about three-dozen states, is opening several for breakfast or brunch on Mother’s Day; at the Fort Worth location, there will be wild blueberry pancakes. And some Red Lobsters are giving Moms a coupon for 10% off their next meal – even including off the Ultimate Endless Shrimp Feast.So, book now, and tip your server. Of all holidays, Mother’s Day is considered so stressful for workers that the National Restaurant Association recommends that owners ensure that their servers are “fed and properly hydrated” and should be given a “combat-duty” bonus – especially the mothers on staff who work the shift.Server Joe Haley, in Quincy, has a better idea: “Why can’t you people just make your Mom breakfast?”",business,0.0

He said she “will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.”Earlier in the day, Yaccarino announced that she was leaving her role as chairman of global advertising and partnerships at NBCUniversal.“It has been an absolute honor to be part of Comcast NBCUniversal and lead the most incredible team,” she said in a statement Friday. “We’ve transformed our company and the entire industry.”As CEO, Yaccarino will face a long list of challenges that have piled up under Musk’s ownership, including an advertiser exodus, service disruptions, regulatory scrutiny and a growing list of rivals. Musk’s controversial policy changes and statements have also alienated some longtime Twitter users.Even as Musk steps back from the CEO role, he will likely still maintain significant control over the future direction of the company. Musk previously said he would serve as the company’s executive chairman and CTO, as well as being the owner of the platform.Musk has clashed with mainstream media outlets and also said he hates advertising. But Yaccarino represents both those worlds.Yaccarino has been at NBCUniversal for more than 11 years, returning to the company where she started as a college intern. Before that she was executive vice president/COO of advertising sales, marketing and acquisitions at Turner Broadcasting, which included CNN at that time.At NBCUniversal, she oversees a 2,000-member global team, according to her company profile. That would be more people on her team than are left working at Twitter, which Musk said in an interview with the BBC last month is down to 1,500 people after multiple layoffs under his watch.NBCUniversal’s ad sales team has generated $100 billion in ad sales since she joined in 2011, according to her profile, and forged partnerships with many new media companies including Twitter as well as Apple News, Buzzfeed, Snapchat and YouTube.Last month she appeared with Musk at an industry conference for a session entitled “Twitter 2.0: From Conversations to Partnerships.”Yaccarino’s most notable achievement at NBCUniversal is creating unified ad sales teams rather than having 15 different sales teams approach the same advertisers.“We were difficult to do business with,” she said in an interview with Salesforce describing the consolidation.The loss of Yaccarino comes at a bad time for NBCUniversal. Ad revenues are down throughout the media industry, prompting cost cutting and in some cases layoffs across many companies. NBCUniversal has had some job cuts of its own, although not as deep as those at some of its rivals.Media companies, including NBC, are scheduled to make “upfront” presentations to advertisers next week in an effort to win ad commitments for later this year. NBC’s session is set for Monday morning.Yaccarino would not be the first or only woman running one of Musk’s companies.Musk previously tapped, Gwynne Shotwell, to run SpaceX. She is president and COO of the company, while he holds the CEO title. But she’s credited by some in the industry as a key to SpaceX becoming the world’s most successful commercial rocket company.Robyn Denholm also serves as chairman of Tesla. She assumed that role from Musk when the SEC required him to give up the position after a tweet in which he claimed he had funding secured to take the company private, when he had not yet locked up the financing to do so.Denholm has kept a low profile at Tesla, not speaking at an investor day earlier this year at which 15 other Tesla executives in addition to Musk spokeThe choice of Yaccarino may hint at Musk recognizing the limitations of his efforts to make Twitter less dependent on advertising.Ad sales represented more than 90% of the company’s revenue before Musk purchased it in October. But many advertisers have fled the site since then.Earlier this year digital marketing analysis firm Pathmatics by Sensor Tower reported that 625 of the top 1,000 Twitter advertisers, including major brands such as Coca-Cola, Unilever, Jeep, Wells Fargo and Merck, had pulled their ad dollars, based data through January 25. Monthly revenue from those previous top 1,000 advertisers plummeted by more than 60% from October through January 25, from around $127 million to just over $48 million, according to the data.Many advertisers have been concerned with Musk’s severe staff cuts, the apparent rise of hate speech, and controversial policy decisions, including his move to invite users back to Twitter who had previously been banned.General Motors said it would pause paying for advertising on Twitter while it evaluates the platform’s “new direction.” Musk blamed the exodus on “activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation.”Musk has tried to increase revenue by racing to bolster its subscription business, charging for the blue checkmarks that verify a user’s identity, with limited success. As a result, he may have little choice but to revive Twitter’s relationships with advertisers and boost its core advertising business.Musk has previously spoken about improving ad sales by focusing more on the relevance of its ads.Ever since he first expressed interest in buying Twitter, the share price of Tesla",business,0.0

But they were missing one thing: tickets.Like so many Swift fans, she couldn’t get tickets on Ticketmaster when they went on sale last fall, nor could she afford the four-figure price tag listed for them on resale sites. About halfway through the drive, however, her sister found $350 floor seats after refreshing various Swift-focused Twitter accounts: Ticketmaster had just dropped a handful of last-minute tickets at face value on its website.“We seriously just got super lucky,” she told CNN. “We made it to Nashville with about an hour to spare before the concert started.”Thomas is one of many devoted fans who closely monitor a mix of Twitter accounts dedicated to alerting fans when Ticketmaster releases a new batch of Swift tickets after the initial sale.Ticket drops are not new. They’re ostensibly due to additional seats being added to a venue, or if tickets are returned. But these drops have become an obsession among Swift’s most devoted fans, who are struggling to find tickets for the artist in the face of Ticketmaster’s broader ticketing snafus.Ticketmaster has been under scrutiny for fumbling the online sales to the mega-star’s latest tour, in an era where it already completely dominates the live event industry, leaving few, if any, alternatives. In November, “Verified Fans” were sent a presale code — but when sales began, heavy demand snarled the website and millions of Swifties could not get their hands on a ticket. Presale tickets for Capital One card holders brought similar frustration — and then Ticketmaster canceled sales to the general public, citing “extraordinarily high demand” and “insufficient remaining ticket inventory.”In testimony before Congress, Ticketmaster parent company Live Nation President and CFO Joe Berchtold partly blamed the ticketing incident on bots. He also emphasized that Ticketmaster does not set ticket prices, does not determine the number of tickets put up for sale and that “in most cases, venues set service and ticketing fees,” not Ticketmaster.Ticketmaster and Live Nation are currently face a lawsuit from Swift fans across the country for “unlawful conduct,” with the plaintiffs claiming the ticketing giant violated antitrust laws, among others. A preliminary hearing was held in March; Ticketmaster has denied the allegations.Millions of fans are still unable to buy tickets. In recent weeks, however, Ticketmaster has been sending out more Verified Fan codes to people who were originally selected from the pre-sale to purchase from leftover tickets. For people without codes, Ticketmaster is also doing routine ticket drops ahead of shows.It’s not unusual, however, that thousands of fans are trying to secure the same tickets at the same time. Sometimes the seats are purchased by bots and scalpers, and reposted to third-party sites like StubHub within minutes.Ticketmaster did not respond to a request for comment about its ticket drops.But that’s not deterring Swift fans. Some are spending hours searching for tickets online and driving long distances to concert venues without a ticket in hand, even if it risks ending in heartbreak.Molly Ramsey, an 18-year-old fan from Bristol, Tennessee, said she recently stumbled across the Twitter account @erastourticks, which often tweets about Ticketmaster’s drops. “My family [last weekend] took the gamble to drive down the 5 hours to Nashville to see if we could get face value tickets,” she said.After nearly nine hours of refreshing Ticketmaster, she secured four tickets right before the show started. “We were sitting outside of the stadium while the openers were playing, but as soon as our payment went through, it was an out-of-body experience,” she said. “My sister started screaming and dancing.”In a nod to Swift’s hit song “Anti-Hero” and the rush to find drop tickets, the Twitter account – which has about 22,000 followers  – recently tweeted: “It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero aka @Ticketmaster.”A similar site, @concertleaks, has been connecting its 62,000 followers to last-minute Swift tickets. The account was originally set up years ago to post concert setlists, merchandise, and tickets for various artists, but has evolved to help connect followers with ticket drops, too.Another Twitter account called @ErasTourResell, which has 120,000 followers, has gained significant traction working with resellers who want to sell their tickets at face value. The account is run by longtime friends Courtney Johnston, Channette Garay and Angel Richards. The trio of twenty-somethings aim to make Swift tickets as accessible to fans as possible without them overpaying or getting scammed.“So far we’ve posted somewhere between 2,700 and 3,000 tickets, all for face value,” the trio said in a DM conversation on Twitter. “It’s truly so rewarding seeing these tickets go to real fans for face value when the resale market has insane prices with people making three times the profit. It’s also been amazing to meet people who follow the account at shows, especially if the only reason they were even able to attend was through our account.”They spend hours, in between working and going to school, sifting through daily submissions to make sure the tickets are real. The group encourages buyers to ask for video proof of tickets, to pay only via Paypal Goods and Services due to its protection plan and to never pay over the face value. (They also said they don’t make any money off the process, and do it only to help fellow Swifties, but they do have a Ko-Fi account where people can donate funds for food or coffee).“Surprisingly, the vetting process has gone immensely well and smoothly because by now we know what a sketchy screen recording looks like or what a forged or hacked email can look like,” the group said. “It’s all about being able to catch the super small details – what color an image is supposed to look like, what link is clickable, where that link has to take you, what message is supposed to pop up at any certain point.”But getting these tickets isn’t easy. After an alert for tickets is posted to their Twitter page, many users say they never hear back from sellers, and it’s unclear how they select a buyer from the hundreds of fans who reach out to them.“It has definitely gotten harder with our amount of followers increasing,” the friends behind @ErasTourResell told CNN. “Some [sellers pick] based off of the first direct message and mention, and others go for someone with a touching story so it truly varies. Having our notifications on helps as we tend to do a little warning and tease before posting most tickets.”Beyond Twitter, many fans are turning to sites such as Reddit, including the R/Taylor Swift page, for play-by-play details on Ticketmaster drops. Some say they’ve spotted them several times throughout the day but most frequently about 30 minutes before a show starts. (Tickets have even appeared an hour into the show.) Others suggest using Apple Pay to expedite the payment process and avoid losing tickets while typing in credit card information.Despite these massive efforts, not all fans find luck online.Katy Blackman, 33, from Birmingham, Alabama, said she spent all day in a Nashville hotel last weekend refreshing the site. Only once did she manage to get a single ticket into her online shopping cart, but it was gone before she could check out.Still, she headed to Nissan Stadium that night and stood in the parking lot alongside hundreds of other fans without tickets trying to get in. When the lights dimmed minutes before Swift took the stage, the crowds scattered; she was nearly the only one left, still refreshing Ticketmaster.“All my searching and combing Ticketmaster and resell sites was worthless,” she said. “But then all of a sudden, a random girl came running up to me truly seconds before she came on and said, “Hey, wanna come in with me?”The stranger had just scored last-minute tickets and had an extra to sell. “A miracle happened,” Blackman said. “My new friend and I sang every single song. We cried, danced, hugged. It was worth the absolute hell to get there.”",business,0.0
820,846,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/business/mcdonalds-chicken-nuggets-burn-lawsuit/index.html,"McDonald’s found liable after child suffers burns from ‘hot’ chicken nuggets, Florida jury finds",2023-05-12 20:07:00,"A South Florida jury returned a split verdict in a civil lawsuit filed against McDonald’s and one of its franchisees that alleged “dangerously hot” chicken nuggets from a Happy Meal burned a toddler, according to CNN affiliate WPLG.The jury on Thursday found that McDonald’s and franchise owner Upchurch Foods liable for failing to properly warn or provide reasonable instructions on the possible harm from the hot McNuggets dispensed at a Tamarac, Florida, drive-thru, the news station reported. However, only Upchurch Foods was found to be negligent. Jurors also found there was no inherent defect in putting McNuggets on the market and no breach of implied warranty.The suit was filed in 2019 against McDonald’s and Upchurch Foods. The Fort Lauderdale jury said both were at some fault for the burns sustained by Philana Holmes and Humberto Caraballo Estevez’s daughter when the hot nuggets fell on to her lap, WPLG reported.The complaint said Holmes bought and paid for the Happy Meal from the drive-thru and then drove away. The nugget fell and became lodged between her 4-year-old daughter’s leg and car seat, the law firm representing the plaintiffs said.“The Chicken McNuggets inside of that Happy Meal were unreasonably and dangerously hot (in terms of temperature),” and caused her “skin and flesh around her thighs to burn,” the complaint alleged, leaving her “disfigured and scarred.”The complaint said the franchise should have known the nuggets were “unfit for human handling,” had a duty not to sell them, and it should have adequately trained and supervised its employees.The law firm representing the plaintiff, Fischer Redavid, said in a blog post that the case will go to a second trial to “determine the damages owed to our client.”The case echoes the infamous McDonald’s hot coffee lawsuit of the ’90s, in which a woman spilled coffee on her lap and suffered third-degree burns. A jury agreed with her contention that the coffee was unreasonably hot. Fischer Redavid noted that the plaintiff in that case was initially awarded nearly $3 million, but she settled for less after an appeal.“This is not the infamous Hot Coffee case; this is Olivia’s case,” the law firm said in a statement to WPLG. “She’s an adorable, innocent child who was severely burned through no fault of her own.”In a statement, McDonald’s called it an “unfortunate incident” but that they “respectfully disagree with the verdict.” McDonald’s defense said it had no control over the injuries and damages.“Our sympathies go out to this family for what occurred in this unfortunate incident, as we hold customer safety as one of our highest priorities,” local McDonald’s owner and operator, Brent Upchurch, said in a statement. “That’s why our restaurant follows strict rules in accordance with food safety best practices when it comes to cooking and serving our menu items, including Chicken McNuggets.”Upchurch said the Tamarac location “did indeed follow” safety protocols.Fischer Redavid’s statement said the verdict “reflected the truth, the facts, and the law.”“We don’t view this as a ‘split verdict.’ Two defendants went to trial, denying liability. A jury found both liable.”- CNN’s Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report",business,0.0
821,847,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/business/washington-commanders-sale/index.html,NFL’s Washington Commanders agree to sell the team to group led by Josh Harris,2023-05-12 17:57:00,"Dan and Tanya Snyder agreed to sell the Washington Commanders franchise to a group led by Josh Harris on Friday, according to a statement from from the team and the investment group.The group also includes NBA legend Magic Johnson as well as Mitchell Rales, the billionaire co-founder of conglomerate Danaher.The agreement is still subject to NFL approval, the statement said. The Wall Street Journal reported the deal is worth about $6 billion.“We look forward to the prompt completion of this transaction and to rooting for Josh and the team in the coming years,” a statement from the Snyders said.Harris, who said he grew up in nearby Chevy Chase, Maryland, is also the majority owner of the NBA Philadelphia 76ers and co-owns the NHL’s New Jersey Devils.Harris’ ownership groups include Johnson and billionaire Mitch Rales, Harris’ longtime sports business partner.“We look forward to running a world-class organization and making significant investments on and off the field to achieve excellence and have a lasting and positive impact on the community,” Harris said in a statement on behalf of the ownership group.Snyder first purchased the team, which was then known as the Washington Redskins, for a reported $750 million in 1999. It became the Commanders’ last year after long criticism for the name.The decision to sell the Commanders came after a lawsuit filed against Snyder, the team and the NFL alleged they colluded to deceive DC residents about an NFL investigation into the team’s toxic workplace culture and allegations of sexual assault. Snyder was also the subject of a 2022 House Oversight Committee panel in which he was accused of fostering a “toxic workplace” and then “conducted a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others, and influence the NFL’s own internal review.”Additionally, the NFL fined the Commanders $10 million and made Snyder hand control of daily operations over to his wife after an internal investigation in 2021. Snyder has denied the accusations.Last year, Snyder announced he was considering selling the team.Forbes had previously estimated the value of the Commanders at $5.6 billion, making it the sixth most valuable football team, after the Dallas Cowboys, the New England Patriots, the Los Angeles Rams, the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears. The only franchises from other sports worth more than that $5.6 billion estimated value are the New York Yankees and New York Knicks.",business,0.0

823,849,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/economy/pakistan-political-crisis-economy-default/index.html,Pakistan’s political crisis will deepen its economic misery,2023-05-12 14:12:00,"The political unrest that’s engulfed Pakistan since former Prime Minister Imran Khan was arrested earlier this week will complicate efforts to secure a financial lifeline from the International Monetary Fund and exacerbate the country’s economic crisis.Growth has stalled and inflation has soared in the South Asian country of 220 million over the past year. With Pakistan’s rupee sharply depreciating and reserves of foreign currency dwindling, the country has struggled to import essential products like food, leading to deadly stampedes at distribution centers. Fears Pakistan could default on its debt have lurked for months.Now, as nationwide protests and violent clashes sweep the country following Khan’s dramatic arrest on corruption charges, the country’s ability to secure much-needed financial help has been cast further into doubt. Khan was released on bail Friday, but told CNN he expected to be arrested again.“It makes things quite complicated,” said Sergi Lanau, director of emerging market strategy at Oxford Economics. “This is very bad news [in] a situation that was already very hard.”The government can probably muddle through in the immediate term, thanks to the forbearance of foreign creditors such as China, but the risk of default will rise unless an IMF deal can be reached soon.Paramilitary troops smashed their way into a courthouse in Islamabad on Tuesday to detain Khan, who was ousted from power last year. His arrest — which the Supreme Court deemed unlawful on Thursday — has unleashed an outpouring of anger. Supporters have stormed buildings and clashed with security forces. At least eight people have died and hundreds have been injured, according to government officials.A spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund, which has been in talks with Pakistan’s government about restarting a $6.5 billion assistance program, said Thursday that negotiators are “heavily engaged” with authorities in Pakistan, which “faces a very challenging situation.”Yet investors are skeptical Pakistan and the IMF can reach an agreement to unlock much-needed funds, with the volatile political environment adding to uncertainty ahead of elections in the fall.The political tumult in Pakistan comes as the country grapples with a dire economic outlook.Growth has slowed to a crawl, while a severe shortfall of dollars is hampering imports. Shortages of food items are contributing to skyrocketing prices. Inflation reached an annual rate of 36.4% in April, with the cost of food rising nearly 47% in urban areas and more than 52% in rural regions.Foreign reserves at the central bank of roughly $4.4 billion are sufficient to cover about a month of imports, according to Tahir Abbas, director of research at Arif Habib, a financial firm in Karachi.What’s known as a “balance of payments” crisis is eroding standards of living in a country still reeling from devastating flooding last year. It could “reverse the poverty gains achieved in the last two decades and further reduce the incomes of already poor households,” the World Bank warned last month.Pakistan’s ability to maintain payments on its debt has also been called into question. Ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the country’s credit rating in late February, noting that foreign currency reserves were “far lower than necessary to cover its imports needs and external debt obligations over the immediate and medium term.”Widespread protests could amplify the pain. Authorities blocked mobile internet services this week in a bid to quell the chaos, a decision GSMA, an industry group representing operators of mobile networks, criticized as harmful to citizens and businesses.“The political uncertainty and crisis-like situation including [protests] are dampening the already ailing economy,” Abbas said.The government has been working with the International Monetary Fund to resume a financing program that’s been stalled since November and expires in June. Julie Kozak, the IMF’s director of communications, said Thursday that the country has “very large financing needs.”“The financing already committed by Pakistan’s external partners is welcome, however, significant additional financing is essential to support the authorities’ policy efforts,” Kozak said.But with elections coming up and public ire mounting, investors think it’s unlikely that reforms requested by the IMF to improve the country’s fiscal position will be agreed, since they would contribute to economic hardship in the near-term.The rupee hit a record low of nearly 300 to the US dollar this week. Pakistan government bonds in dollars, meanwhile, have been trading at distressed prices.“Cutting spending and increasing taxes is not an easy thing to do at all,” said Lanau. “These are things that in the run-up to an election are not palatable to anyone.”Gerwin Bell, lead Asia economist at PGIM Fixed Income, which holds Pakistan bonds, said the firm’s “long-standing” view is that “the government would not be able to provide needed assurances to the IMF.”“The current political events only reinforce our view,” Bell added.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a televised address Friday that the country’s economic problems stem from his predecessor.“As you know the currency is navigating through difficult times,” he said. “The challenges we inherited are contributing immensely to aggravating the situation.”He continued: “The previous government violated an agreement with the IMF and we are making attempts to repair that.”Without help from the IMF, which is seen as essential to unlocking funding from other sources, the risks Pakistan could default on its debt rise. But there’s still a chance the country avoids that outcome.“We do not think the risk of default is very high,” Bell said. “Private sector bond debt is very small, and large bilateral creditors have so far been willing to roll over maturities,” he added, noting that China and the Gulf economies “are not eager to trigger defaults.”Yet the threat could hang over the country for some time. Abbas said that while the country “can manage” through July, and possibly into August, “it will be absolutely crucial to resume the IMF program or embark on a bigger IMF program to manage the external sector crisis.”Moody’s has estimated that Pakistan’s external financing needs for fiscal year 2024, which starts in July and runs through next June, are in the range of $35 billion to $36 billion.In February, the ratings agency said about 50% of government revenue will need to go to debt interest payments “for the next few years,” compounding economic woes and fanning political discontent.“A significant share of revenue going towards interest payments will increasingly constrain the government’s capacity to service its debt while also meeting the population’s essential social spending needs,” Moody’s wrote in its report.— Sophia Saifi contributed reporting.",business,0.0

Bob Menendez to name a Latino to the Fed, praised Kugler in a statement as a “highly qualified and respected economist with deep expertise in labor markets.”Menendez celebrated the groundbreaking nomination at the Fed, saying in a statement: “Simply put, we are witnessing history unfold in real time.”“We are ushering in a new chapter at the Federal Reserve, which for 109 years has never had Latinos or Latinas in the upper echelons of its leadership,” Menendez said. “We are finally giving Latinos, all 62 million of us who call this country home, a seat at the table where the most consequential decisions on monetary policy are made.”Last year, Kugler was confirmed with bipartisan support to serve as the US executive director to the World Bank. Her name has been mentioned in media reports as a candidate to fill the open seat at the Fed created when Lael Brainard left the Fed in February to serve as the director of the White House’s National Economic Council.Kugler, who is currently on leave from Georgetown University, previously worked in the Obama administration as the Labor Department’s chief economist. She brings to the Fed extensive research experience and expertise in labor economics. Her work has examined the role that public policies, such as unemployment benefits and minimum wages, play in labor-market outcomes.Jefferson, who joined the Fed as a governor a year ago, has been tapped by Biden to the influential role of vice chair, serving as the No. 2 official behind Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. He joined the Fed board in May 2022, after winning broad bipartisan support during his congressional confirmation process. Jefferson has indicated support for the Fed’s aggressive approach in combating inflation in past speeches.The Fed’s board consists of seven members, including two vice chairs; one who serves in the absence of the chairperson and another in charge of supervising and regulating financial institutions. The vice chair role was previously held by Brainard.Jefferson’s decades-long career includes stints in economics and academia. He taught economics at Swarthmore College, Columbia University and the University of Virginia, and served as a high-ranking administrator at Davidson College. He also worked as a research economist at the Fed’s Board of Governors.He has a bachelor’s degree in economics from Vassar College and two post-graduate degrees from the University of Virginia.In a speech this week, Jefferson said that he believes “inflation will start to come down and the economy will have the opportunity to continue to expand.”Biden also announced he will renominate Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to serve at the Fed, to an additional full term as Fed governor. Last year, the Senate confirmed Cook to a term that expires in January.“These nominees understand that this job is not a partisan one, but one that plays a critical role in pursuing maximum employment, maintaining price stability and supervising many of our nation’s financial institutions,” Biden said.Friday’s nominations underscore Biden’s intention of elevating individuals with diverse backgrounds to key government posts.Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, praised Biden’s Fed nominees as people who “reflect the vibrant diversity of our country, and the people who make it work.”“These historic nominees have built their careers by putting workers and communities at the center of our economy,” Brown said.South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the top Republican on the Banking Committee, said he looks forward to “thoroughly vetting these nominees and determining if they are equipped to address our nation’s economic challenges.” Scott added that it’s critical during today’s period of high inflation that Fed nominees are “exceptionally qualified.”",business,0.0

Consumers are now taking notice.“While current incoming macroeconomic data show no sign of recession, consumers’ worries about the economy escalated in May alongside the proliferation of negative news about the economy, including the debt crisis standoff,” Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a release. “If policymakers fail to resolve the debt ceiling crisis, these dismal views over the economy will exacerbate the dire economic consequences of default.”The latest survey showed that the university’s consumer-sentiment index fell by 9% in May. The index’s latest decline wiped out more than half of its gains since recovering from the record low in June 2022.“In Washington’s past fiscal games of chicken, sentiment recovered within a few months of the crises ending,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in analyst note. “On the other hand, if the government defaults, it won’t be pretty.”Pessimism among consumers can have an impact on their spending behavior if their expectations worsen and they decide to pull back. Some data have already pointed to demand for goods weakening some.American households continue to cut down on spending, according to a separate report released Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Monthly household spending growth tumbled to 5.4% from a revised 7.1% in December, according to the New York Fed’s Household Spending Survey, which is fielded every four months. The survey showed that Americans plan to rein in their spending even further as the year goes on: Expected monthly spending growth fell to 3.4% in April, dropping 0.6 percentage points, and landing in a realm not seen since December 2020.Michigan’s report showed US household spending was flat in March from the prior month, after limping just 0.1% in February. Retail sales sank 0.8% in March from the prior month, following a 0.5% decline in February. The Commerce Department releases April figures on retail spending next week, which will offer additional clues into how demand is shaping up as credit conditions tighten.A trio of recent bank failures mean that banks are poised to toughen their lending standards even more, which can dampen demand. A recent survey of loan officers showed that banks were making it harder to access credit even before the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Stack on top of that the Federal Reserve’s punishing interest-rate increases and still-high inflation, and consumers might just tap out.Many economists, including those at the Fed, expect the US economy to slip into a recession later in the year. A recession is a broad economic downturn that would include weakness in consumption.The Conference Board’s sentiment survey showed that consumer confidence worsened in April as Americans became more worried about the jobs market. The business group’s Consumer Confidence Index, which measures attitudes toward the economy and the job market, fell to 101.3 in April, down from 104 in March and marking the lowest level since July 2022.The labor market is still going strong. Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, a robust gain, and the unemployment rate fell back to a 53-year low of 3.4% that month. That’s good news, but the job market still isn’t balanced, because “labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his news conference after officials voted to raise the central bank’s benchmark lending rate by a quarter point earlier this month.– CNN’s Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.",business,0.0

It had been under pressure from investors to determine what to do with merchandise after Adidas terminated its partnership with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.“When we will do that and how we will do that is not clear yet, but we are working on those things,” Gulden said, according to a transcript provided to CNN from Adidas.

829,855,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,Why current US recession warnings are unlike all the others,2023-05-12 07:44:00,"Economic experts are once again ringing the alarm bells over an imminent downturn. A US recession is coming, they say, in the second half of 2023. That time frame begins less than three weeks from now.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned on Thursday of great economic danger lurking just over the horizon. Given the risks that lie ahead, he told Bloomberg news, “I would take a mild recession happily.”Billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller didn’t mince his words this week at the Sohn Investment Conference. A hard landing is coming, he cautioned, and “it’s just naive not to be open-minded to something really, really bad happening.”For more than a year CEOs, economists, analysts and their kind have been warning of an imminent economic downturn, The economy, meanwhile, has remained relatively resilient through it all.Things weren’t great last year: Inflation hit a 40-year peak, gas prices were elevated, consumer sentiment plunged and markets fell by 20%. Still, the United States managed to avoid a recession.“This has been the most predicted potential recession in memory,” said Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Tom Barkin way back in January.So why should we listen now?There are two reasons, noted Paul Christopher, head of investment strategy at Wells Fargo: Higher interest rates and tightening credit.The Federal Reserve has raised rates higher and more quickly than they have in decades, and some say that the ongoing US regional banking crisis is an early warning sign of stress on the system.The Fed’s own experts predicted in March that “the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments,” would lead to “a mild recession starting later this year.”Bank failures can make borrowing harder, which can curb spending and weigh on economic activity. A Fed survey, released Monday, confirmed that lenders are stiffening their standards in the wake of the banking collapses — demand for and supply of loans is now close to 2008 levels.“The bottom line for markets is that with inflation still at 5%, well above the [Fed’s] 2% inflation target, and the Fed not cutting rates anytime soon, credit conditions will continue to tighten and, as a result, a recession is coming that could be deeper or longer than the consensus currently expects,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management.What comes next: The United States is approaching one year since inflation peaked at 9.1% in June of 2022. Historically, recession typically coincides with that peak, said Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist for LPL Financial. But that doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods.If the economy were to go into recession in the second half of the year, we could chalk up the more delayed economic downturn to a Fed that was initially behind the curve in fighting inflation along with monetary policy acting with its typical lag,” said Gilbert. Tailwinds from post-pandemic demand had also contributed to economic resilience, he added.Dimon sharply criticized former President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying the 2024 presidential candidate doesn’t understand the debt ceiling and what is at stake. It is just “one more thing he doesn’t know very much about,” Dimon told Bloomberg Television.Trump said in a CNN town hall Wednesday night that a default would be preferable to a result that doesn’t stop the government “spending money like drunken sailors.”Economists and congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle say an extended default would hurt the US economy, triggering widespread unemployment, surging interest rates and sparking a global downturn.Defaulting on the US debt would be “potentially catastrophic,” Dimon said Thursday.“The closer you get to it, you will have panic. Markets will get volatile, maybe the stock market will go down, the Treasury markets will have their own problems,” he said. “This is not good.”Dimon also expressed concerns that US creditworthiness could be downgraded, as it was during the 2011 debt limit crisis.Dimon told Bloomberg that he has been hunkering down in a so-called “war room” once a week in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, for the possibility of a debt default.As the June 1 “X-date” approaches — when the US Treasury could run out of cash and extraordinary measures they’re currently using to pay all government obligations — Dimon said he will convene his war room more often. By May 21, he expects to meet every day.Elon Musk has been vowing to relieve himself of the top position at Twitter for some time. On Thursday, he took a step toward making good on that promise.“Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter.

It also upgraded its economic forecasts Thursday, saying it now expects the UK to dodge a recession this year, mostly thanks to a sharp drop in energy prices.The central bank expects the UK economy to grow by 0.25% this year and by 0.75% in 2024 — a much more positive assessment than in February, when it forecast contractions of 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively. Governor Andrew Bailey said it wasn’t a “strong forecast,” just less weak than the bank’s previous projections.“The UK remains the only G7 country in which the main quarterly measure of GDP has not recovered to its pre-Covid peak yet,” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a Friday note.Consumer price inflation in the UK remains stubbornly high, holding above 10% in the year to March. The ONS said that higher prices had weighed on real household spending in the first quarter, which was flat, compared with an uptick of 0.2% in the final quarter of 2022.“With the key services side of the economy continuing to slow in the face of higher borrowing costs and rising prices, it still feels like we’re walking through treacle,” Tom Stevenson, personal investing director at Fidelity International, said in a Friday note.“With inflation still in double digits, it feels depressingly like a re-run of the 1970s.”The Bank of England expects inflation to fall sharply over the coming months.",business,0.0

From 2019 to March 2023, Tesla sold about 1.09 million vehicles in the country, according to CNN calculations based on figures from China’s state-backed industry associations.The models to be recalled include imported Model S, Model X, Model 3 and China-made Model 3 and Model 6.The vehicles have issues that may increase the probability of drivers “mistakenly stepping on the accelerator pedal” for an extended period, which could increase the risk of collision and pose a “safety hazard,” the statement said.The company plans to make adjustments or add notification features to the recalled vehicles to reduce the risk, it added.In March, Tesla recalled more than 2,600 imported Model S cars in China, according to the SAMR. The hood of those vehicles could pop open unexpectedly while driving, posing safety risks for the vehicle and other cars.China is a major sales and manufacturing center for Tesla, which broke ground on a huge factory in Shanghai in January 2019. That facility, which was built within 10 months at 65% of the cost of a similar plant in the United States, has already become the company’s main export hub.The Shanghai facility supplies vehicles to most markets outside of North America. It’s unclear whether vehicles from that factory sold outside mainland China will be subject to the same recall. Tesla has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.",business,0.0
834,860,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/economy/china-carbon-emissions-record-intl-hnk/index.html,"China’s record carbon emissions expected to peak due to clean energy push, report says",2023-05-12 03:09:00,"China’s carbon emissions will likely hit a new record in 2023 on the back of an economic rebound, but a rapid expansion in green energy will enable its emissions to peak soon, a global energy think tank said on Friday.China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gas, saw its carbon dioxide emissions rise 4% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2022, reaching more than 3 billion tonnes, according to a new report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) for Carbon Brief. That’s the highest first-quarter number on record.The increase was driven by an economic rebound after the end of China’s zero-Covid policy, economic stimulus measures and weak hydro generation due to an ongoing drought, the Helsinki-based think tank said.“Looking at the rest of the year, the government’s focus on economic growth means that China’s emissions are likely to reach an all-time high in 2023, topping the previous peak in 2021,” said Lauri Myllyvirta and Qi Qin, analysts at CREA.However, the emissions could peak soon, as China has accelerated its clean energy push and installed record amounts of solar and wind power capacity, the analysts pointed out.“The rapid expansion in low-carbon energy, if sustained, could enable emissions to peak and enter structural decline, once the post-Covid recovery has played out,” they said.China’s economy rebounded in the first quarter of 2023, with GDP growth accelerating to 4.5%, according to official statistics released last month. The government previously set a growth target of “around 5%” for 2023, although many investment banks have raised their forecasts to above 5.5%.The largest contributor to rising emissions was electricity generation. Power output from coal increased by 2% from a year ago, the report showed. Coal is the main source of energy in China and is widely used for heating, power generation and steelmaking.The country has ramped up coal production since last summer when the worst heatwave and drought in decades hit hydroelectricity, the country’s second biggest source of power. Coal production surged 11% in 2022 from 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.To boost coal imports, China scrapped its restrictions on Australian coal earlier this year, effectively ending an unofficial ban that lasted for more than two years. In the first quarter, China’s total imports of coal soared 96% from a year earlier.The second biggest reason for rising emissions was the higher production volumes of construction materials, mainly steel and cement, the CREA analysts said. That’s mainly because of government stimulus measures for the manufacturing and construction industries.“Emissions are likely to grow this year,” the analysts said, as the government is pursuing a broad-based approach to economic recovery that seeks to boost exports, manufacturing output and construction, in addition to consumption.This will lead to a sharp increase in bank lending and investment, particularly for manufacturing, transportation and energy production, they added.However, China still sees clean energy as its future. President Xi Jinping restated his vision for a “green” and “beautiful” China in February and called for an energy revolution to achieve carbon neutrality in the longer term.Solar installations increased to a record 34 gigawatts (GW) in the first three months of the year, nearly tripling the previous high of 13GW in the same period of 2022, according to latest figures released by the National Energy Administration.New wind power installations also reached a record high. The 10.4GW added in the three months to March 2023 was an increase of 32% over the period in 2022, the NEA figures showed.These sources of power, including renewables and nuclear, exceeded 50% of China’s installed power capacity in the first quarter, overtaking fossil fuel-based capacity for the first time in history, the CREA analysts said.“When low-carbon power growth matches — and then exceeds — the annual increase in electricity demand, the sector’s CO2 emissions will peak,” they said.",business,0.0

It would disproportionately hurt states with large concentrations of federal workers or that have a number of jobs that rely on government funding. That includes Washington, DC, and states located near or that rely on federal institutions such as national labs or military bases such as Alaska, Hawaii and New Mexico.Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania would also likely lose hundreds of thousands of jobs apiece if there is a breach of the debt ceiling lasting several months, the economic research group found.Federal workers are not likely to lose their jobs in the event of a breach — unlike a government shutdown, where non-essential federal employees could be furloughed temporarily. But federal workers and the military may face delays in receiving their paychecks.Federal contractors may also not be paid on time, and that could affect their ability to compensate and employ their workers.The analysis spells out other widespread damage: The unemployment rate would spike to near-double digits in the District of Columbia (8.9%), California (8.7%) and Ohio (9.5%). Michigan’s unemployment rate would reach 10.8%, up from 4.1% today.Other states that would feel significant impact are ones that rely on federal spending and aerospace, such as Virginia, Connecticut, Kansas and Washington.Moody’s said tourism-dependent states including Arizona, Florida and Nevada will eventually experience “sharp” job loss as well those that rely on auto manufacturing, like Michigan and South Carolina.In the event of a prolonged breach of the debt ceiling, Moody’s estimates some large states would each lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. California could lose 841,600. Texas may lose 561,700. The report predicts Florida would lose 474,700 jobs, New York could shed 398,300, and Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia would each lose more than 200,000.In its report, Moody’s assigns a 10% probability to a breach of the debt ceiling, up from 5% previously.“What once seemed unimaginable now seems a real threat,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi wrote in the report.A breach is not the same thing as a default.In an email to CNN, Zandi explained that a breach would occur if the Treasury Department fails to make a payment to any creditor on time – whether that be a Social Security recipient or the electric bill for a government building in Omaha.A default would only occur if Treasury fails to make a debt payment on time, Zandi said.In the report, Zandi wrote that if there is a breach, it would be “much more likely to be a short one than a prolonged one,” though even a “lengthy standoff no longer has a zero probability.”The new warning from Moody’s comes a day after a meeting on Tuesday between President Joe Biden and Congressional leaders ended without any progress on a debt ceiling deal.Zandi noted that although there are some emerging signs of concern in financial markets, for the most part investors “appear largely unruffled” by the estimated June 1 deadline.“The longer it takes for financial markets to react,” Zandi wrote, “the greater the odds that lawmakers will not act in time, since market turmoil is probably what it will take to generate the political will lawmakers will need to come to terms.”",business,0.0

And it would spark a global downturn that would set us back much further,” Yellen said Thursday in Niigata, Japan, where she is attending a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers.“It would also risk undermining US global economic leadership and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests,” she added.Yellen said Congress was no stranger to raising or suspending the debt limit — having done so almost 80 times since 1960 — and urged it to act quickly to do so once again.She spoke a few hours after former US President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024, took questions from voters at a CNN town hall. He suggested Republicans should refuse to raise the debt limit if the White House does not agree to “massive” spending cuts.“If they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default, and I don’t believe they’re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave,” he said in response to a question.As leaders in Washington fail to make progress on a debt ceiling deal, Yellen has forecast that the United States could run out of cash and extraordinary measures to pay its bills as soon as early June.To prompt action, Yellen has been stepping up warnings on the matter in recent days, even personally calling CEOs to discuss the consequences of brinkmanship around the debt ceiling, a source has told CNN.In a report published last week, White House economists said a protracted default would wipe out more than 8 million jobs and cut the value of the stock market in half. The report estimated the impact under three scenarios: brinksmanship, a short default and a protracted default.A White House spokesperson said the protracted default scenario envisions a three-month long impasse.Even a brinksmanship scenario, where a default is avoided, would wipe out 200,000 jobs and knock 0.3 percentage points off annual GDP, according to estimates from Washington.A US default would also have far-reaching consequences. Such an event could affect the value of the US dollar, as well as hurt demand for imports from other countries to the world’s largest economy.The US Treasury chief also laid out her “three core priorities” for the G7, one of which is to bolster the global fight against inflation.Additionally, the group intends to redouble commitment to support Ukraine’s defense against Russia, and to discuss “longer-term work to bolster economic resiliency and security,” Yellen said.",business,0.0
838,864,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,Wall Street is strangely calm about the possibility of the US defaulting on its bills,2023-05-10 11:54:00,"Dire warnings about the economic chaos and catastrophe that will ensue if the US debt ceiling isn’t lifted soon abound. Still, markets remain rather sanguine about the Washington drama.Don’t expect that to last much longer. Analysts say Wall Street has identified its own X-date in late May, and if there is no major movement in Congress by then, they expect some major market volatility.What’s going on: The United States is running out of money, and if Congress doesn’t act to raise or suspend its self-imposed borrowing limit, the country could soon default on its bills.That’s a really big deal. A default would, in the words of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, cause “an economic catastrophe.”A lengthy default would wipe out about 8.3 million jobs and bring unemployment 5 percentage points higher, economists at the White House said last week. Even under a shorter default, the economy would suffer the loss of about half a million jobs and the unemployment rate would rise by 0.3 percentage points, they said.The Treasury could run out of cash and extraordinary measures to pay all government obligations as soon as June 1, according to Yellen. That’s about three weeks from now.Moody’s Analytics last week said that the United States could hit its default date on June 8, significantly earlier than its previous projection of August 18. Other, more conservative estimates, put the X-date in August.Investors don’t appear to be panicking. Markets moved higher in after-hours trading Tuesday despite little progress being made towards a deal to raise the debt ceiling during an hour-long meeting between President Joe Biden and top congressional leaders. The major indexes were down slightly in pre-market trading Wednesday ahead of the CPI inflation report.Markets react: There are a few reasons investors appear to be shrugging off this potential economic catastrophe.First, they may not believe a default will actually happen — the debt ceiling was instituted in 1917 and since then the limit has been suspended or raised over 100 times, often with political drama attached. The debt ceiling crisis of 2011 caused Standard and Poor’s to downgrade US debt for the first time in history. In 2013 the country also came within days of defaulting.“I think in the stock market in general there’s a feeling of the little boy who cried wolf: this will get solved at the last minute, which we’ve seen in the past,” Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist for AGF Investments told CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans on Tuesday.“But this is different,” he said. “I think the [Republican] militants in the House [of Representatives] are a new factor here and for the markets to be this sanguine to me is not warranted.”Second, investors might be taking the crisis seriously but don’t know how to react to it, Gustavo Schwenkler, professor of finance at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, told me.“There are so many ways this can go. It’s not quite clear how equity markets will react to this event because it’s just something that has never happened.”Markets could be displaying a delayed reaction while investors wait for more information, he added.Wall Street’s X-date: Analysts appear to be in agreement that the end of May is when investors will start to lose their cool.Schwenkler says to expect “a lot more volatility” if debt ceiling issues don’t appear resolved by the last week of the month.“You probably have another week or so” before investors get serious, Nicholas Bohnsack, president and head of portfolio strategy at Strategas, said TuesdayIn a note last week, JPMorgan Asset Management chief global strategist David Kelly also identified the final days of May as when equity market volatility will rise.What comes next: If Congress fails to increase or suspend the debt ceiling in time, said Kelly, expect a “major stock market meltdown.”But, he said, markets should be able to recover quickly. “It is best not to think of the debt-ceiling crisis as a potential rerun of the Great Financial Crisis,” he wrote.“Restoring confidence in the US banking system in the wake of the subprime crisis was an immensely complicated and uncertain task. By contrast, recovery from a debt-default crisis would likely start the day Congress, belatedly, suspended the debt ceiling,” he added.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been calling on CEOs and other business leaders to discuss the consequences of brinkmanship around the debt ceiling, reports my CNN colleague Matt Egan.After months of relative silence, business advocates are beginning to speak out against the budgetary impasse.“With the US at risk of defaulting on its obligations as soon as June 1, meaningful, bipartisan discussions on raising the debt ceiling can no longer wait,” Josh Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, wrote in a statement Tuesday.“A default would deliver a severe blow to the economy, leading to widespread job losses, decimated retirement savings and higher borrowing costs for families, businesses and the government,” said Bolten.Michael Hanson, chief lobbyist at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that retailers have been pounded by supply chain woes and the pandemic, and don’t need any more economic headwinds.“What they crave more than anything is a period of relative calm and certainty after 3-plus years of managed chaos,” he wrote. “A misstep over the debt ceiling would subject businesses and consumers to an economic shockwave,” he added.Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce, also said in a statement last week that “the full faith and credit of the United States government should never be placed at risk.”Recession fears are in the air but they have yet to reach Airbnb. The company reported strong revenue growth on Tuesday and even set a new record for bookings during the first three months of the year.“More guests are traveling on Airbnb than ever before,” CEO Brian Chesky said on a call with analysts Tuesday. “We’ve seen our highest number of active bookers ever, despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties.”“During the quarter, we also saw guests booking trips further in advance, supporting a strong backlog for Q2,” he added. “We were especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific as nights booked in Q1 increased more than 40% year over year.”Despite the rosy earnings report, shares of Airbnb slid as much as 10% in after-hours trading Tuesday after the company reported a weaker outlook for the current quarter than some analysts had expected, reports my CNN colleague Catherine Thorbecke.",business,0.0
840,866,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/tech/ai-search-google-io/index.html,The world’s most popular search engine is about to look different,2023-05-10 21:52:00,"Google is moving forward with plans to bring AI chat features to its core search engine as it works to keep pace with a wave of new artificial intelligence tools that could threaten the company’s dominance online for the first time in decades.The company on Wednesday said it is introducing the next evolution of Google Search, which will use an AI-powered chatbot to answer questions “you never thought Search could answer” and to help get users the information they want quicker than ever.With the update, the look and feel of Google Search results will be noticeably different. When users type a query into the main search bar, they will automatically see a pop-up with an AI-generated response in addition to displaying traditional results.Users can now sign up for a waitlist for the new Google Search, which will first launch in the United States, via the Google app or Chrome’s desktop browser. A limited amount of users will have access to it in the coming weeks, according to the company.The updates were unveiled at I/O, the company’s annual developer event, which focused on a mix of AI and hardware products. At the event, Google also announced PaLM 2, its latest AI language model to rival ChatGPT-creator OpenAI’s GPT-4. The move marks a big step forward for the technology that powers the company’s AI products and promises to be better at logic, common sense reasoning and mathematics. It can also generate specialized code in different programming languages.The moves come as Google’s rivals, including Microsoft, are racing to develop and deploy AI features in search engines and productivity tools in the wake of the viral success of ChatGPT. The immense attention on ChatGPT reportedly prompted Google’s management to declare a “code red” situation for its search business.In addition to the changes to search, Google is expanding access to its existing chatbot Bard, which operates outside the search engine and can help users do tasks such as outline and write essay drafts, plan a friend’s baby shower, and get lunch ideas based on what’s in the fridge. The tool, which was previously available to early users via a waitlist only in the US, will soon be available for all users in 120 countries and 40 languages.Google is also launching extensions for Bard from its own services, such as Gmail, Sheets and Docs, allowing users to ask questions and collaborate with the chatbot within the apps they’re using.But incorporating AI chatbots comes with some risks. These tools have sparked concerns about tone and accuracy, the latter of which is of particular important for the online search engine that has long been the cornerstone of Google’s business.In CNN’s virtual demo of the tool ahead of Wednesday’s announcement, the AI search tool answered questions about why bees were so important to our ecosystem, whether the Sound Hotel in Portland, Oregon has Peloton bikes (it does) and what are some local chess camps for kids, in a matter of seconds.The tool scans websites, extracts related information and packages it neatly at the top of the results page, highlighting the sources in a section set off to the side.But it’s not perfect; in one search for the “best pizza places in New York City,” the results were populated with restaurants from San Francisco.Cathy Edwards, Google’s VP of search, told CNN that it’s still “very early on” and the company will continue to make changes in the weeks and months ahead.“We really want to learn and … and iron out the kinks,” Edwards said. “We don’t want to bring this experience to everyone until we have confidence that we’ve nailed it.”Unlike other chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Snapchat’s My AI tool and Bard, Google’s search tool is purposefully devoid of a “persona.”“We made a deliberate decision for it to only reflect information on the web,” Edwards said. “It won’t respond with ‘I think’ or express opinions on things. It is not something that feels like a lot of other chatbots out there.”But that choice can make for a jarring experience, if you’ve spent months using other tools. When CNN asked Google’s tool for suggestions on how to balance work and life with children at home, it offered no words of empathy or connection for the daily juggle, unlike other chatbots.The new Google Search also offers a Perspectives feature to showcase what other people are buying or thinking about, and factoring that into results. Another tool called, About This Image, understands facts about an image, so users can ask questions about when Google first saw the picture and if it appears on other websites. The feature aims to provide “a level of understanding of an image rather than taking it at face value,” Edwards said.These efforts highlight Google’s commitment to move forward with AI even as the technology behind it has sparked concerns.In March, Google was called out after a demo of Bard provided an inaccurate response to a question about a telescope. Shares of Google’s parent company Alphabet fell 7.7% that day, wiping $100 billion off its market value.Microsoft’s AI chatbot was also called out for errors made in a demo.Like ChatGPT, the new Google Search and Bard are built on a large language model. They are trained on vast troves of data online in order to generate compelling responses to user prompts, but these tools are also known to get responses wrong or “hallucinate” answers.Google previously told CNN that Bard would serve as a separate, complementary experience to Google Search, and planned to “thoughtfully” add large language models to search “in a deeper way” at a later time.“We’ve been on a 25 year journey for search, and it still remains such an unsolved problem,” Edwards said. “The next long arc which will be measured in decades will be this, so we want to be bold but want to be responsible and get it right.”",business,0.0

Visit americanexpress.com to learn more.Our quick take: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is an ideal choice for people just getting started with travel rewards, since it offers a solid return on travel and dining purchases and earns some of the most valuable travel points around. The card is currently offering an increased sign-up bonuses of 80,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening.Pros:Cons:Current sign-up bonus: Earn 80,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. But you’ll have to act quickly — this offer is ending soon.Best for: People with larger than average travel and/or dining expenses who want basic transferable travel points.See if you qualify for the Chase Sapphire Preferred with an 80,000-point bonus.If you’ve done any research on credit cards, then the Chase Sapphire Preferred may sound familiar. At close to 15 years old, it’s practically the granddaddy of travel rewards credit cards.The Sapphire Preferred offers 2 points per dollar on all travel or if purchased through Ultimate Rewards, you’ll earn 5 total points per dollar spent. You’ll also earn 3 points per dollar spent on dining, select streaming purchases and online delivery purchases (excluding Walmart, Target and wholesale clubs) and 5 points per dollar on Lyft rides through March 2025.When you have the Sapphire Preferred, you’ll also get discounts on DoorDash food delivery orders, strong travel protections and a 80,000-point sign-up bonus — all for a reasonable $95 annual fee. Plus, the Chase Ultimate Rewards points you earn with this card are among the most valuable points around.Additionally, on your account anniversary, you’ll earn a 10% point bonus on all purchases made the previous year. That means if you spend $10,000 on the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, you’ll earn an additional 1,000 bonus points.But is that enough for the card to justify a spot in your wallet? The credit card market has evolved immensely since the Chase Sapphire Preferred was first introduced. Other cards now offer bonus points or cash back in those same travel and dining categories — in some cases at higher rates — as well as other notable benefits like annual travel credits and airport lounge access.The key difference, however, is that those other cards are typically accompanied by higher annual fees. So if you aren’t ready to shell out a lot of money for an expensive credit card, the Chase Sapphire Preferred is an excellent starting point.The Chase Sapphire Preferred currently offers new card holders an increased 80,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account. With this generous offer, it’ll get you off on the right foot for your next vacation. But again, this offer is ending soon, so apply quickly if you want to take advantage of it.This is even a higher offer than the more luxurious Chase Sapphire Reserve® where you’ll earn a slightly inferior 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 after the first three months of account opening.Points earned with the card can be redeemed for travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal at a rate of 1.25 cents per point, so you’re guaranteed at least $1,000 in travel right off the bat.You can potentially get even more value by taking some time and effort to maximize Chase’s airline and hotel partners. In fact, the Ultimate Rewards program features some of the best transfer partners, including United Airlines, Southwest and Hyatt Hotels. And with a 2 cent apiece valuation, the 80,000 points earned are worth $1,600 when transferred to a partner loyalty program.Here’s a complete list of Chase’s 14 partners, all of which transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio — meaning for every 1,000 Chase points, you’ll get 1,000 airline or hotel points or miles when you transfer them:The reason you’d want to transfer Ultimate Rewards points instead of redeeming them through the Chase travel portal is because airlines and hotels sometimes sell travel for different rates depending on whether you’re paying in cash or points, which means you can sometimes score some fantastic deals by transferring points, especially if you want to fly in first or business class.Even with many airlines and hotel chains shifting to dynamic-pricing frequent flyer systems, award redemption rates around high-demand dates and holidays often don’t get the same markups as the cash rates. And as travel companies emerge from the pandemic, they’re offering some great points deals in an effort to fill seats on planes and rooms in hotels.There are also many hidden gems when booking award flights on partner airlines, particularly in premium cabins. A little bit of research and due diligence can definitely save you a lot of money (or points) in the long run.Click here to earn 80,000 bonus points on the Chase Sapphire Preferred.Beyond the sign-up bonus, the Chase Sapphire Preferred earns 2 points per dollar on all travel (or 5 total points if purchased through Ultimate Rewards), 3 points per dollar spent on dining, select streaming purchases and online delivery purchases (excluding Walmart, Target and wholesale clubs) and 1 point on everything else.It should be easy to quickly score plenty of points, since Chase defines both of these popular categories very broadly. “Travel” includes purchases like cruises, mass transit, tolls, parking and even ride-shares, while “dining” includes coffee shops, bars, vending machines and most food delivery services.Additionally, you’ll earn a 10% bonus on all purchases made the previous year on your cardmember anniversary. So if you spend $10,000 on the card during the previous year, you’ll earn an additional 1,000 bonus points.There’s one exception to the travel bonus category, but it’s a positive one. Thanks to a partnership with Lyft, through March 2025, Sapphire Preferred card holders earn 3 additional points per dollar on Lyft rides for a whopping total of 5 points per dollar.Other key benefits of the card include discounts on DoorDash food delivery orders via a complimentary DashPass membership that’s valid for at least 12 months as long as you activate it by Dec. 31, 2024. You’ll also receive a $50 annual credit on hotel stays purchased through Ultimate Rewards.The Chase Sapphire Preferred also has a comprehensive suite of purchase and travel protections, including an additional year of coverage on eligible purchases with a manufacturer’s warranty of three years or less, protection on your new purchases against damage or theft, coverage of up to $10,000 in the event your trip gets delayed or canceled, reimbursement for delayed or lost baggage and, most notably, primary rental car coverage.What does “primary rental car coverage” mean? Whenever you use your card to pay for a car rental, you can safely decline the collision damage waiver offered by the rental company — which is usually expensive — and submit the claim directly to Chase instead if you have an accident with your rental car.The car rental coverage that’s offered by other credit cards is usually secondary, meaning you have to look to your own auto policy first in the event of an accident. With the Sapphire Preferred, you can skip that step and avoid potentially seeing your auto premiums increase as a result of a claim.To top it all off, the Chase Sapphire Preferred has no foreign transaction fees, so you can safely use it and earn rewards when traveling overseas once borders reopen. Other credit cards can charge 3% to 5% in fees for foreign transactions, so having this benefit can make a big difference to international travelers.Get the Chase Sapphire Preferred for its travel perks and bonus points on travel and dining.The Chase Sapphire Preferred doesn’t offer the same luxury travel perks — like airline lounge access and travel credits — as the Chase Sapphire Reserve. That’s expected, considering the annual fee is also a lot lower, but worth noting given the other similarities between the two cards.It’s also worth pointing out that although the Sapphire Preferred’s $95 annual fee is fairly standard among mid-tier travel credit cards, a few other cards in this category waive their annual fee in the first year, though many no longer do. On the flip side, the Sapphire Preferred does have a higher sign-up bonus than most other cards.While the bonus categories cover a wide range of purchases, keep in mind there are cards like the Citi® Double Cash Card that earn 2% cash back on all purchases — 1% when you make a purchase, and another 1% when you pay it off — and come with no annual fee at all.So if it’s straight cash back you’re after, you might be better off with another card. But if you spend a lot on dining, travel (especially on Lyft rides), streaming services and online grocery shopping and could use the travel and shopping protections, you’re going to come out ahead with Sapphire Preferred.Even if you don’t utilize the Ultimate Rewards program’s transfer partners, you’re getting at least 2.5% back toward travel on all your travel and 3.75% on all dining, select streaming services and select online grocery purchases since your points are worth at least 1.25 cents each, and 6.25% back on Lyft rides. Just don’t plan to carry a balance with the card, as there’s no introductory interest rate on purchases or balance transfers.The one other downside of the Chase Sapphire Preferred pertains to the application process, and it applies to all Chase credit cards. Chase has an unpublished “5/24” rule, which means if you’ve gotten five or more credit cards across all banks in the previous 24 months, your application for a new card from Chase will be automatically denied. Given this restriction, it’s important to time your credit card applications and apply for the Sapphire Preferred early on.CNN Underscored has chosen the Citi Double Cash card as our current “benchmark” credit card. That doesn’t mean it’s the best credit card on the market — rather, we use it as a basic standard to compare other credit cards and see where they score better, and where they’re worse.Here’s how the Chase Sapphire Preferred scores against our benchmark. The features of each card in the below chart are colored in green, red or white. Green indicates a card feature that is better than our benchmark. Red indicates the feature is worse than our benchmark, and white indicates the feature is either equivalent or cannot be directly compared to our benchmark.When reviewing other credit cards, we use this format and these criteria to compare them with our benchmark. You can read our credit card methodology for more details on what we take into account when it comes to perks, protections and redemption value.Start earning points to fly in first class with the Chase Sapphire Preferred.Aside from the Sapphire Preferred’s older sibling, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the closest comparison to the Sapphire Preferred would be the Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card.It has the same $95 annual fee as the Sapphire Preferred, but it comes with a Global Entry/TSA PreCheck application fee credit worth up to $100 that helps offset it in the first year. It currently has a sign-up bonus of 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account.Capital One miles are somewhat less valuable, as they’re worth only 1 cent apiece when redeemed toward travel. They can also transfer to Capital One’s airline and hotel partners, and the issuer has recently improved its transfer program by setting almost all of its transfer ratios at 1-to-1, with just one hotel at 2-to-1 and one airline at 2-to-1.5. You can find more details in our review of the Capital One Venture card.American Express fields the American Express® Green Card, which was refreshed in 2019 and now offers 3 points per dollar on all travel and dining, and 1 point per dollar on everything else. It also features an up to $189 annual CLEAR® credit for expedited airport security, and up to $100 in annual LoungeBuddy credits for purchasing airport lounge access.However, these additional perks come at a cost. The Amex Green has a higher price tag of $150 a year, and it comes with a lower welcome bonus of just 45,000 points after spending $2,000 on purchases in the first six months after opening the account.All information about the American Express® Green Card has been collected independently by CNN. The American Express® Green Card is not currently available through CNN.With travel picking up, having a stash of travel points is going to be extremely useful. But whether the Chase Sapphire Preferred makes sense for you personally ultimately depends on what you spend the majority of your money on, and what you hope to get in return.Given its bonus categories, the Sapphire Preferred is ideal for those who spend a significant amount of money on travel, dining, online groceries and streaming services. Likewise, while you don’t need to be loyal to a particular airline or hotel chain, you do need to actually travel (or at least want to travel more) to maximize the card’s benefits and redemption opportunities.While you can get decent value from your points with the card’s fixed-value redemption option, the Chase Sapphire Preferred unlocks access to some of the best transfer partners around, so it’s also an excellent opportunity to dip your toes in the world of travel rewards and grow your knowledge on loyalty programs.If cash back sounds more appealing to you, a card like the Citi Double Cash could make more sense. Or if you’re chasing more luxurious travel perks like airport lounge access, you’ll also want to look elsewhere — the premium Chase Sapphire Reserve version of this card is a great alternative for that, and The Platinum Card® from American Express is also a popular option.But in the end, regardless of which redemption option you pick, the Chase Sapphire Preferred’s soon-to-end 80,000-point sign-up bonus is more than sufficient to book your first award trip. So consider whether the card fits your needs, and as always, be sure to pay your balance in full each month to avoid high interest rates.Learn more and apply now for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card.Find out which cards CNN Underscored chose as our best credit cards currently available.Get all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money.",business,0.0
861,887,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/sbf-wealth/index.html,"In less than a week, Sam Bankman-Fried's $16 billion fortune evaporated","04:24 PM, Sun May 14, 2023","Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”",business,0.0
864,890,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/health/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-therapy-fda/index.html,"Families facing rare muscle disease are pushing for an experimental gene therapy, but the FDA is skeptical",2023-05-12 19:24:00,"Most parents wouldn’t be thrilled with the idea of their kids getting hooked up to an IV bag filled with trillions of viruses.But for Melanie Hennick, whose son, Connor, has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, it was an opportunity she hoped would change his life.“We knew this wasn’t a cure,” Hennick said. “But it was a chance.”Connor is one of just dozens of kids to have received SRP-9001, an experimental gene therapy that aims to slow or stop the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD. Current treatments for the disease – which primarily affects boys because of the way it’s inherited – include steroids and, later, heart drugs. But none stop it.SRP-9001 uses viruses to ferry a copy of a gene to muscles to help make up for one that’s causing the disease. Hennick and many other parents like her advocated for the treatment’s accelerated approval Friday in a meeting of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration.The advisers voted 8-6 in favor of approving the treatment, and the FDA will now decide whether to follow their advice.“The decision the FDA has to make doesn’t just affect the patients in study 301 [an ongoing confirmatory trial that Sarepta is running]; it affects the entire field of drug development for Duchenne,” said Dr. Caleb Alexander, a professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, who voted against recommending approval. “The totality of evidence … simply doesn’t rise to the threshold that’s required for accelerated approval.”Dr. Raymond Roos, a neurology professor at the University of Chicago Medical Center, voted in favor. “The downside of the gene therapy here is relatively small compared to whether it really helps the patient, and for this reason, I voted yes,” he said.Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said his agency will take the recommendation and “do something that we have to do every day at FDA. … We have to manage through the uncertainty here.”The FDA’s decision, expected by the end of the month, will have implications not just for families like Connor’s but for how the agency regulateths treatments like this one more broadly: It would be the first of its kind of medicine – one-time treatments delivering a gene to try to fix a disease – to get accelerated approval, a faster track through the regulatory process. Its approval would set a precedent for other drugs like this based on so-called surrogate endpoints, a measure of what the drug does in the body, before further clinical evidence is available.“Approval of a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy will be huge,” said Jeffrey Chamberlain, a professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine who helped pioneer gene therapy approaches for the disease. “This, I think, will spur further research and further development of gene therapies for other diseases.”DMD patients don’t have a lot of time to wait. Kids with Duchenne typically lose the ability to walk before they’re teenagers and often don’t live well into their 30s, Chamberlain said. He’s not directly involved with SRP-9001, which is being developed by Sarepta Therapeutics, and is on the scientific advisory board for another company working on DMD gene therapies, Solid Biosciences.“Gene therapy appears to be a really good approach to try to treat this disease, because it’s a genetic disease,” Chamberlain said. “The cause of the disease is a mutation in a single gene.”That gene is responsible for the production of dystrophin, a protein key to the structure of muscle cells.“It’s kind of like the two-by-fours that make up your house,” Chamberlain said. “It’s really important for just holding everything together.”SRP-9001, invented at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, before being licensed for development by Sarepta, delivers a miniaturized version of the dystrophin gene to cells, aiming to help them make a version of the muscle-preserving protein.In a key clinical trial, the therapy appeared to do that. But it didn’t meet another main goal: showing a benefit on a measure of muscle function, complicating SRP-9001’s path through the FDA.Sarepta blamed the outcome on an imbalance in how the trial separated patients into the placebo and treatment groups. But key FDA reviewers appear unconvinced.“The clinical studies conducted to date do not provide unambiguous evidence that SRP-9001 is likely beneficial for ambulatory patients with DMD,” agency reviewers wrote in briefing documents released ahead of Friday’s meeting, referring to patients who can still walk – the group who will initially be eligible for the treatment if it gets approved.Family after family who participated in Sarepta’s trials, like the Hennicks, disagree with the reviewers. They say they believe that the treatment has helped keep their kids walking and running in ways they never would have without it.“It’s really miraculous,” said Nate Plasman, whose son Andrew got SRP-9001 as part of the trial in January 2019, at age 4.Andrew was away from school for more than two months when he got the experimental therapy, Plasman said, and when he returned, “his teachers at the preschool were blown away,” he recalled. “They’re like, ‘Who is this kid?’ He’s running. He’s jumping. He’s pedaling the tricycle. He’s getting up and down off the ground” – all things he couldn’t do as well  before the therapy.Marit Sivertson, mom to 9-year-old Brecken, agrees.“We’ve seen the incredible changes with our son,” she said. “He’s not just walking around. He’s running; he’s swimming; he’s diving. He’s truly living the life that every 9-year-old boy ought to be living.”Sivertson and Plasman also spoke at Friday’s meeting. Their goal isn’t to secure the therapy for their own kids; because it’s designed as a one-time treatment, they wouldn’t take it again. They say they’re speaking up on behalf of children who are still waiting.That wait is especially painful for Daniel and Lindsey Flessner, who have two sons with DMD. Their 5-year-old son, Mason, is in the SRP-9001 clinical trial. Their 2-year-old, Dawson, is still too young.“With every trip, every fall, every time he stands up by walking up his legs using his hands to help stabilize him, it just keeps chipping away at us,” Flessner said. “It’s very painful as the parents watching your children struggling knowing all you can do is wait, when waiting is what you don’t have time for.”In addition to questions about how well the treatment works, the FDA reviewers raised concerns about safety, particularly “related to the possibility of administering an ineffective gene therapy.”The reviewers focused on opportunity cost: Because of the viruses used to deliver the gene, patients can develop an immune response that could render future doses ineffective.Chamberlain said work is underway to find ways to be able to administer more doses, if needed, but it’s currently a one-and-done treatment.For now, he thinks this approach is the best hope for DMD patients.“It’s not perfect,” he acknowledged. “It’s not a complete cure, but from what I can gauge from the clinical results that have been released by Sarepta and some of the other companies, I think the micro-dystrophin gene therapy is working better than any other drug that’s been tried for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.”It’s unclear how long the effects will last; Sarepta is continuing trials, and a confirmatory study would be required as part of accelerated approval. Sarepta has proposed a trial that it’s already running to satisfy that requirement, with results expected later this year.For families facing DMD, there’s an opportunity cost to waiting, too. In its briefing documents for the FDA meeting, Sarepta estimated that accelerated approval would speed up broad access to SRP-9001 by at least a year, a time in which about 400 boys could lose the ability to walk and another 400, whose disease is more advanced, would die.Melanie Hennick said Connor was admitted to the trial just weeks before he’d have aged out, at 8 years old. She said she believes the therapy is the reason Connor’s doing so well.“We had the opportunity to see Connor grow as an 8-, 9-, 10-, 11- and 12-year-old with more capacity than we ever dreamed,” she said. “He climbs stairs unaided; he runs around; he plays football; he plays hockey; he plays on a baseball team. … Those are things that we never thought we would be able to see him do, especially at 12.”",health,0.0
868,894,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/health/peanut-allergy-patch/index.html,Skin patch shows promise in toddlers with peanut allergies,2023-05-10 20:33:00,"A “peanut patch” showed promising results in a late-phase clinical trial in toddlers with peanut allergies, according to a new study.Researchers from the French biopharmaceutical firm DBV Technologies and institutions around the world conducted randomized double-blind trial of the Viaskin Peanut patch in children ages 1 through 3 years old who had been diagnosed with a peanut allergy, they reported Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.The trial involved 362 toddlers from eight countries; 244 were randomly assigned to receive the Viaskin patch – which features 250 micrograms of peanut protein, the equivalent of about 1/1000th of one peanut – and 118 got a placebo patch. They wore the patches between their shoulder blades daily for a year before undergoing screening for peanut challenges.After 12 months, two-thirds of the children who used the Viaskin patch and one-third of the placebo group had met the trial’s primary endpoint. Children with a less sensitive allergy could safely tolerate peanut protein equivalent to consuming three or four peanuts, and children who were more sensitive could tolerate the equivalent of consuming one peanut.The researchers also noted “a shift towards less severe food challenge reactions” in the Viaskin group, DBV said in a news release.Nearly all of the young study participants had adverse events, with the most common being application-site reactions such as redness, itching and swelling. Serious events were reported in 21 children who used the Viaskin patch and three in the placebo group.Over the course of the study, a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis was reported in 7.8% of the Viaskin recipients and 3.4% of children who got the placebo. Only four of the reactions were deemed to be related to treatment. Eight participants dropped out of the trial because of adverse events.The researchers note that their study has several limitations, including that children with a history of severe allergic reactions were excluded for safety reasons and that there was a lack of racial diversity among the participants.An estimated 2.5% of US children may have peanut allergies, and only about 20% will eventually outgrow them. An oral treatment called Palforzia is approved for 4- to 17-year-olds with peanut allergies, but there are no available options for younger kids.“Parents and caregivers are eagerly awaiting FDA-approved treatment options for this age group,” DBV CEO Daniel Tassé said in the news release.The study’s lead author, Dr. Matthew Greenhawt of Children’s Hospital Colorado, said in the news release that the findings are a “meaningful advancement.”“I see peanut-allergic patients in my clinical practice daily. I speak with parents who are experiencing increased anxiety and a decreased quality of life due to fear of life-threatening reactions,” he said. “The Viaskin Peanut patch has the potential to give new hope to toddlers and their families who currently have no approved treatment options and must instead rely on avoidance, which can severely impact quality of life.”In an editorial published alongside the study, Dr. Alkis Togias of the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases noted that “Peanut allergy can be very substantially reduced if peanut is introduced into the diet as early as 4 to 6 months of age.” Health care providers around the world now advise such introduction, but there are questions about dosage, age, frequency and duration, he said.“Toddlers are of particular interest since their immune systems have plasticity that can theoretically allow for higher efficacy and longer-lasting benefits from allergen immunotherapy after therapy is discontinued,” wrote Togias, who was not involved in the new research.Compared with oral therapy, he said, skin patches may have less of a protective effect but a better safety profile.Still, he said, the Viaskin trial findings “are very good news for toddlers and their families as the next step toward a future with more treatments for food allergies.”",health,0.0

We haven’t had this. We haven’t had health-based ventilation standards,” said Joseph Allen, director of the Harvard Healthy Buildings Program.Allen says that although it’s easy to see the guidance only in the context of Covid-19, it will help with many other airborne hazards like wildfire smoke, allergens and other infectious diseases, such as the flu.The move comes the day after the US ended its public health emergency for Covid-19.  Public health officials have long downplayed the role of airborne spread in the transmission of infectious disease, and it took years of lobbying by indoor air quality experts for the CDC to acknowledge the importance of ventilation in controlling the pandemic.“I am pleasantly surprised to see CDC add this guidance. I do find it ironic that they finally published ways to end the pandemic at the same time as declaring it is over,” said Kimberly Prather, an atmospheric chemist at the University of California at San Diego and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.In May 2020, Prather and her coauthors published a perspective article in the journal Science, explaining the airborne spread of Covid-19.  Later that year, she and more than 200 other scientists penned a letter to the World Health Organization and other public health authorities asking them to acknowledge and develop guidance to stop airborne spread.“If they had broadcast and implemented these changes at the beginning, there never would have been a pandemic,” Prather said.The new CDC guidance was developed in conjunction with a new standard from the American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers.The CDC says better indoor ventilation can reduce the concentration of viral particles in the air, lowering the risk that a person would breathe them in and get sick.  Improved ventilation can also lower the amount of virus person might inhale, potentially lowering their infectious dose, which could play a role in the severity of their infection.The new guidance offers detailed recommendations for how to make indoor air healthier.  Some of the strategies are as simple as opening a window to let in more outdoor air and using fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows.In addition to better air circulation, the CDC recommends cleaning indoor air, using MERV-13 air filters in your HVAC system if possible.  Air cleaners or purifiers may be helpful if they use high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA).  The CDC says these are most important in high-risk areas like schools and medical offices.  Systems that use UV light to kill germs may also be helpful.As for how much ventilation is enough, the CDC suggests at least five air changes per hour to reduce germs. That’s the equivalent of what a portable air cleaner provides as long as it’s properly sized for the space it’s used in, the CDC says.Ventilation and air cleaning strategies together can help meet the target.",health,0.0

It blocks receptors in the brain that play a role in the regulation of body temperature.  It’s an alternative to traditional hormone replacement therapies to manage hot flashes, which are a common symptom of menopause that can be disruptive if they become severe.Women at higher risk of stroke, heart attacks, or some kinds of cancer are sometimes advised against using hormone replacement therapies because they increase the risk of blood clots and cancers.“Hot flashes as a result of menopause can be a serious physical burden on women and impact their quality of life,” said Dr. Janet Maynard, director of the FDA’s Office of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a news release. “The introduction of a new molecule to treat moderate to severe menopausal hot flashes will provide an additional safe and effective treatment option for women.”Menopause is a normal period in a woman’s life that usually begins in her mid- to late 40s. During menopause, the body produces less estrogen and progesterone.  The tapering of these hormones can trigger sleep disruptions, mood swings and hot flashes – periods of sweating, flushing and chills that may last several minutes.In clinical trials that included more than 3,000 women in the US and Canada, Veozah reduced the number of hot flashes women experienced each week significantly more than a placebo.  The studies followed women who took the drug for a year.Veozah comes with a warning about a risk of liver injuries.  The FDA says women who are considering taking it should have blood tests to make sure they don’t have any liver damage or infection before starting the medication, and they should be monitored with blood tests every three months to make sure they don’t show signs of liver damage while taking the drug.The most common side effects reported in the studies were abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, back pain, hot flush and elevated liver enzymes.",health,0.0
873,899,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/health/sexual-assault-nurse-examiners-kff-health-news-partner/index.html,How the nursing shortage may lead to gaps in sexual assault care,2023-05-12 06:44:00,"Jacqueline Towarnicki got a text as she finished her day shift at a local clinic. She had a new case, a patient covered in bruises who couldn’t remember how the injuries got there.Towarnicki’s breath caught, a familiar feeling after four years of working night shifts as a sexual assault nurse examiner in this northwestern Montana city.“You almost want to curse,” Towarnicki, 38, said. “You’re like, ‘Oh, no, it’s happening.’”These nights on duty are Towarnicki’s second job. She’s on call once a week and a weekend a month. A survivor may need protection against sexually transmitted infections, medicine to avoid getting pregnant, or evidence collected to prosecute their attacker. Or all the above.When her phone rings, it’s typically in the middle of the night. Towarnicki tiptoes down the stairs of her home to avoid waking her young son, as her half-asleep husband whispers encouragement into the dark.Her breath is steady by the time she changes into the clothes she laid out close to her back door before going to bed. She grabs her nurse’s badge and drives to First Step Resource Center, a clinic that offers round-the-clock care for people who have been assaulted.She wants her patients to know they’re out of danger.“You meet people in some of their most horrifying, darkest, terrifying times,” Towarnicki said. “Being with them and then seeing who they are when they leave, you don’t get that doing any other job in health care.”A former travel nurse who lived out of a van for years, Towarnicki is OK with the uncertainty that comes with being a sexual assault nurse examiner.Most examiners work on-call shifts in addition to full-time jobs. They often work alone and at odd hours. They can collect evidence that could be used in court, are trained to recognize and respond to trauma, and provide care to protect their patients’ bodies from lasting effects of sexual assault.But their numbers are few.As many as 80% of U.S. hospitals don’t have sexual assault nurse examiners, often because they either can’t find them or can’t afford them. Nurses struggle to find time for shifts, especially when staffing shortages mean covering long hours. Sexual assault survivors may have to leave their town or even their state to see an examiner.Gaps in sexual assault care can span hundreds of miles in rural areas. A program in Glendive, Montana — a town of nearly 5,000 residents 35 miles from the North Dakota border — stopped taking patients for examinations this spring. It didn’t have enough nurses to respond to cases.“These are the same nurses working in the ER, where a heart attack patient could come in,” said Teresea Olson, 56, who is the town’s part-time mayor and also picked up on-call shifts. “The staff was exhausted.”The next closest option is 75 miles away in Miles City, adding at least an hour to the travel time for patients, some of whom already had to travel hours to reach Glendive.Nationwide, policymakers have been slow to offer training, funding, and support for the work. Some states and health facilities are trying to expand access to sexual assault response programs.Oklahoma lawmakers are considering a bill to hire a statewide sexual assault coordinator tasked with expanding training and recruiting workers. A Montana law that takes effect July 1 will create a sexual assault response network within the Montana Department of Justice. The new program aims to set standards for that care, provide in-state training, and connect examiners statewide. It will also look at telehealth to fill in gaps, following the example of hospitals in South Dakota and Colorado.There’s no national tally of where nurses have been trained to respond to sexual assaults, meaning a survivor may not know they have to travel for treatment until they’re sitting in an emergency room or police department.Sarah Wangerin, a nursing instructor with Montana State University and former examiner, said patients reeling from an attack may instead just go home. For some, leaving town isn’t an option.This spring, Wangerin called county hospitals and sheriff’s offices to map where sexual assault nurse examiners operate in Montana. She found only 55. More than half of the 45 counties that responded didn’t have any examiners. Just seven counties reported they had nurses trained to respond to cases that involve children.“We’re failing people,” Wangerin said. “We’re re-traumatizing them by not knowing what to do.”First Step, in Missoula, is one of the few full-time sexual assault response programs in the state. It’s operated by Providence St. Patrick Hospital but is separate from the main building.The clinic’s walls are adorned with drawings by kids and mountain landscapes. The staff doesn’t turn on the harsh overhead fluorescent lights, choosing instead to light the space with softer lamps. The lobby includes couches and a rocking chair. There are always heated blankets and snacks on hand.First Step stands out for having nurses who stay. Kate Harrison waited roughly a year to join the clinic and is still there three years later, in part because of the staff support.The specially trained team works together so no one carries too heavy a load. While being on night shift means opening the clinic alone, staffers can debrief tough cases together. They attend group therapy for secondhand trauma.Harrison is a cardiac hospital nurse during the day, a job that sometimes feels a little too stuck to a clock.At First Step, she can shift into whatever role her patient needs for as long as they need. Once, that meant sitting for hours on a floor in the lobby of the clinic as a patient cried and talked. Another time, Harrison doubled as a DJ for a nervous patient during an exam, picking music off her cellphone.“It’s in the middle of the night, she just had this sexual assault happen, and we were just laughing and singing to Shaggy,” Harrison said. “You have this freedom and grace to do that.”When the solo work is overwhelming or she’s had back-to-back cases and needs a break, she knows a co-worker would be willing to help.“This work can take you to the undercurrents and the underbelly of society sometimes,” Harrison said. “It takes a team.”That includes co-workers like Towarnicki, who dropped her work hours at her day job after having her son to keep working as a sexual assault nurse examiner. That meant adding three years to her student loan repayment schedule. Now, pregnant with her second child, the work still feels worth it, she said.On a recent night, Towarnicki was alone in the clinic, clicking through photos she took of her last patient. The patient opted against filing a police report but asked Towarnicki to log all the evidence just in case.Towarnicki quietly counted out loud the number of bruises, their sizes and locations, as she took notes. She tells patients who have gaps in their memories that she can’t speculate how each mark got there or give them all the answers they deserve.But as she sat in the blue light of her computer screen long after her patient left, it was hard to keep from ruminating.“Totally looks like a hand mark,” Towarnicki said, suddenly loud, as she shook her head.All the evidence and her patient’s story were sealed and locked away, just feet from a wall of thank-you cards from patients and sticky notes of encouragement among nurses.On the harder evenings, Towarnicki takes a moment to unwind with a pudding cup from the clinic’s snacks. Most often, she can let go of her patient’s story as she closes the clinic. Part of her healing is “seeing the light returned to people’s eyes, seeing them be able to breathe deeper,” which she said happens 19 out of 20 times.“There is that one out of 20 where I go home and I am spinning,” Towarnicki said. In those cases, it takes hearing her son’s voice, and time to process, to pull her back. “I feel like if it’s not hard sometimes, maybe you shouldn’t be doing this work.”It was a little after 11 p.m. as Towarnicki headed home, an early night. She knew her phone could go off again.Eight more hours on call.",health,0.0
878,904,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/14/health/single-mom-parenting-wellness/index.html,Let us now praise single moms,2023-05-14 03:07:00,"Roughly 24 million, or one-third of all American children under age 18, are living with an unmarried parent, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center analysis of US Census Bureau data. And 81% of those single parent homes are headed by a mom.This has been a growing trend since the late 1960s. The number of kids being raised by mostly single moms has more than doubled between 1968 and 2017.Yet despite growing up in the middle of this trend, in the 1970s and ’80s, when divorce was increasingly common and “Kramer vs. Kramer” felt like the documentary of our childhood, and despite being part of a generation of latchkey kids who came home from school while parents were still at work, I was, I confess, embarrassed to be raised by a single mom when I was growing up.For the majority of my 12 years of Catholic school, I was the only student who lived with one parent. And for that reason, I was also, demonstratively, the poorest kid in my school. We lived off one paycheck, or paychecks when my mom held multiple jobs at once. The modest child support went to school tuition.Like most kids, I didn’t want to be different. I wanted to be “normal.” “Why can’t we just be normal?” I’d often lament to my mom.I was embarrassed by our car, which broke down; embarrassed that we didn’t seem to go anywhere for vacation; that I didn’t have brand-name clothes (thank God for school uniforms that greatly leveled the playing field); or video games; or cable TV; or anything else that my classmates had. I was embarrassed that my dad, who lived in a neighboring state, never came to any school events.And I was teased for it. “Why don’t you get a new car?” “Your gym shoes are fake Nikes.” “Do you even have a dad?” I was often angry. I got into a lot of fights. When the principal’s office called home because I got into it with another kid, it was always my mom who had to come in.Of course, my mother, like all parents, only added to that embarrassment. She was, and still is, artistically inclined and health-conscious. We went to museums and art stores instead of amusement parks and toy stores. I went to a summer camp run by cloistered monks … in heavy brown robes. My mom performed in community theater and sometimes roped me into bit parts. We went to clown school … together. At Christmas, I often got books and clothes. And my mom shopped for groceries at health food stores, which was much more unusual back then and involved a lot of bulk foods, homegrown sprouts and warm, freshly ground peanut butter. I had an all-carob Easter one year. I was embarrassed by my un-tradable school lunches and embarrassed at meals when friends spent the night.Sitting under a framed movie poster of Richard Attenborough’s “Gandhi,” my friend would stare at an unappetizing breakfast bowl of “natural” cereal I poured for him out of a bulk food bag. His breath would blow a few rice puffs out of the bowl and across the table. “We can drizzle honey on it!” I’d say, as if that would solve everything. And then he’d go home to eat his Honeycomb or Count Chocula or whatever.“Why can’t we just be normal?”There has been a lot of research over the decades that has shown children of single parents report more family distress and conflict and live at a lower socioeconomic status compared to those growing up in two-parent households. Two-parent families usually have more income and are generally able to provide more emotional resources to children, and that’s also a reflection of how little the United States in general does to support working mothers with parental paid leave and access to more health services and quality education.And of course, it’s difficult to compare single parenting outcomes to hypothetical alternatives. For many, a single mom can create a much safer or more stable environment than living with an abusive parent and spouse. Just growing up in an unhappy marriage has an effect on children.A 2017 study, however, looked at the long-term effects of single parenthood on kids and found that it had nearly no impact on their general life satisfaction. The authors also found no evidence “supporting the widely held notion from popular science that boys are more affected than girls by the absence of their fathers.” What mattered most in terms of thriving, they concluded, was the quality and strength of the relationship between children and parents.A separate 10-year study on single parenting that collected data from 40,000 households in the UK came to a similar conclusion last year. “There is no evidence of a negative impact of living in a single parent household on children’s wellbeing, with regard to self-reported life satisfaction, quality of peer relationships, or positivity about family life,” the report states. “Children who are living or have lived in single parent families score as highly, or higher, against each measure of wellbeing than those who have always lived in two parent families”Speaking for myself, I’d go further and say there were benefits to being raised by a single mother, that it was foundational to becoming the adult I am now.Being raised by a single parent required an Emersonian amount of self-reliance. I got myself to school in the morning, figured out how to apply to college, paid my way through that education and embarked on a career with no shortcuts or introductions. Our poverty made me class-conscious even as I earned my way into the middle class myself. My role model for what women are and should be was smart, strong, independent and deserving of all respect.Even my childhood embarrassment was character-building, giving me a deeper sense of self-worth that is dependent neither on material things nor the opinion of those I don’t admire.I’m not embarrassed now. Being raised by a single mother means the opposite to me today: I have a pride in her for enduring so much (including the indignity of a son perpetually embarrassed by our situation).But even as a kid, I thought of her as a role model of resilience and resourcefulness. She imparted integrity, a love of the arts and a sense of occasion for the things I loved, like “Star Wars” and Orioles baseball. Before the age of 10, I was exposed to classical music, classic film, anti-nuclear activism, boxing (as participant) and yoga (long before it was a thing people did at gyms). And her exuberant creativity meant she was also a lot of fun growing up. We once invented a board game about the holidays of the world’s religions. On weekend mornings, we went to a park near a music conservancy to hear musicians practice while we ate our granola breakfast.Nothing about the financial and logistical stress of our years together kept her from raising a responsible, decent, curious, creative and accomplished son with very high life satisfaction. She gets more credit for that than any other individual, except maybe me. I’m not embarrassed, I’m grateful.Let us now praise single mothers. All of them. The “weird” ones. The struggling ones. The driven ones who choose to parent alone. The widowed, who didn’t. The brave ones who divorced for the well-being of their kids and/or themselves. They are all raising about 19 million children right now, and they need all the support they can get.",health,0.0
879,905,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/20/health/how-to-stop-mouth-breathing-sleep-wellness/index.html,Mouth breathing might be ruining your sleep. Here’s how to fix it,2023-05-14 02:15:00,"Living with a plugged nose isn’t fun, but James Nestor was ready. Plus, it was for science.While researching his book, “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,” Nestor let Stanford University scientists block his nostrils with silicone and surgical tape to measure the impacts of breathing through his mouth for 10 days.“We knew it wasn’t going to be good, because there’s a very firm scientific foundation showing all the deleterious effects of mouth breathing, from periodontal disease to metabolic disorders,” Nestor said.The surprise was just how quickly the experiment affected him.Nestor’s blood pressure rose 13 points, edging the writer into stage one hypertension. Measurements of heart rate variability showed his body was in a state of stress. His pulse went up, and he stumbled around in a mental fog.He also snored for hours each night, developing obstructive sleep apnea. His blood oxygen levels dropped.“We had no idea it was going to be that bad,” Nestor said. “The snoring and sleep apnea was so dramatic, and it came on so quickly, that everyone was pretty floored.”What Nestor learned, aside from the hazards of being a research subject, was that mouth breathing can ruin a good night’s sleep.Breathing through your mouth at night puts you at higher risk for sleep disorders including snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea, the partial blockage of air, scientists have found. Each of those, in turn, can lead to daytime fatigue.That doesn’t mean you’re doomed to wake up in a daze because you’re prone to mouth breathing when you sleep.Experts have a long list of strategies designed to turn you into a nasal breather — including a low-cost breathing hack you can pick up at the corner store.There is a long list of reasons why people breathe through their mouths at night, said Dr. Steven Park, a surgeon with a specialty in sleep medicine.“The most common reason is if your nose is stuffy,” Park said. “From allergies, or if you have a deviated septum. Lots of medications can also cause nasal congestion.”Those problems are aggravated by lying down, he explained.“Generally when you lie down the blood vessels inside your nose fill up with blood,” he said, explaining that the rush of blood causes swelling and constriction. If you can’t breathe easily through your nose, you’re likely to open your mouth for air, Park said. That triggers a positive feedback loop.“You would think that if you open your mouth you would breathe better, but actually the reverse happens,” he said. Opening your jaws causes the tongue to slump backward, obstructing your airway. “Even if you don’t have sleep apnea, or you have mild sleep apnea, opening your mouth makes it much, much worse.”How do you know if you’re mouth breathing at night? Many people, Park noted, are tipped off by a spouse or partner who notices that they’re breathing through the mouth.If you wake up with a dry mouth or lingering tiredness, they may be warning signs. Another indication of sleep apnea or other disturbed sleep is if you have to visit the bathroom multiple times in the night, said Park. Interrupted breathing stresses the heart, Park explained, triggering the release of hormones that cause you to produce more urine.When Nestor blocked his nose for science, he experienced an extreme version of mouth breathing. But in retrospect, he realized he’d been waking up with a dry mouth for some time, a sign he’d been ditching nasal breathing for at least part of the night.If you’re tackling your nighttime mouth breathing, Park suggested you start by taking care of your nose to minimize congestion.“Number one, avoid eating close to bedtime,” he said. That’s because stomach juices can come up into your nose, sinuses, ears and mouth, causing congestion and inflammation.Park also recommended nasal saline irrigation, flushing the nose with salt water in a squeeze bottle. “That’s a mild decongestant, because the salt water draws out clear water from the membrane,” he explained. (Over-the-counter decongestant sprays can cause habituation and rebound symptoms, Park said, and should be reserved for short-term use.)Breathing problems are so widespread that they’ve spurred a whole industry dedicated to opening your nose. Park said some people find relief from nasal strips, which open up the nose from the outside, or nasal dilators that expand air passages from within.But even if you get your nose to clear, nighttime mouth breathing can be a hard habit to break. That’s led some to seek out products that secure their lips closed at night.Many experts warn against mouth taping while you sleep, because it can be dangerous.“If you have obstructive sleep apnea, yes, this can be very dangerous,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, in a previous CNN article.“There is limited evidence on the benefits of mouth taping and I would be very careful — and even talk to your health care provider before attempting it,” Dasgupta added.Dasgupta recommended seeing an ear, nose and throat doctor or a sleep specialist to get a diagnosis and treatment plan.",health,0.0
884,910,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/04/health/controlled-prescriptions-telehealth-public-health-emergency-wellness/index.html,Getting prescription meds via telehealth might change soon. Here’s how to prepare,2023-05-09 17:58:00,"For three years now, the expansion of telehealth has made care more accessible for many people, especially those in rural areas. Patients have been able to receive prescriptions from providers without seeing them in person. But that may change come May 11 when the federal government is set to end the Covid-19 public health emergency declaration that made this convenience possible.Before the pandemic, medical practitioners were subject to the conditions of the Ryan Haight Act, which required at least one in-person examination before prescribing a controlled medicine, said Dr. Shabana Khan, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s Committee on Telepsychiatry.“There are seven exceptions, and one of them is a public health emergency declared by the secretary of (health and human services), which is what we’ve had for the past three years,” Khan said. “It was immensely helpful … and allowed many Americans to get their medical care without having to come in person, so we could treat patients completely remotely.”“The administration and HHS has put out a notice that they don’t intend to renew it any further,” Khan said, “so the federal public health emergency is going to be expiring May 11.”Returning to pre-pandemic rules means people who were prescribed controlled medications via telehealth — such as stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepines for anxiety, or medications for opioid use disorder, sleep or pain — will need one in-person medical examination to continue these prescriptions or start new ones.The US Drug Enforcement Administration’s website has a general list of controlled substances, and an exhaustive list can be found here.Patients will still be able to get prescriptions for non-controlled medications, such as antibiotics or birth control, via telehealth. The pre-pandemic rules also wouldn’t affect telehealth care by a practitioner who has already conducted an in-person examination of a patient.To establish some flexibility in the telehealth framework moving forward, Khan said, the DEA has put forth proposals (PDF) that would allow telehealth practitioners to prescribe one 30-day supply of buprenorphine — a medication for opioid use disorder — or Schedule III-V non-narcotic controlled medications without doing an in-person examination first. A patient would have to do an in-person exam before the second prescription of either type of medication, according to those proposals.But there’s no guarantee that will happen — public comment on the proposals was open through March; since then, the DEA has been considering comments before drafting final regulations.“It is really important to start planning now,” Khan said. “For many medicines, it can be a risk to abruptly stop treatment.”People who are on medications for opioid use disorder, ADHD or anxiety and don’t get an in-person exam between May 11 and the next time they need a prescription refill could experience withdrawal requiring a trip to the hospital, or negative effects on health, relationships, employment or academics, she added.Here’s what else you should know about the changes and steps you should take, according to Khan.This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.CNN: How should people prepare to ensure their prescription routine isn’t disrupted?Khan: It’s important for patients who may be prescribed one of these types of medicines by a telemedicine physician or other practitioner to reach out to that practitioner to discuss this issue and make sure that they have a plan. And if it’s feasible to see that telemedicine physician in person, schedule that as soon as possible.CNN: What if you can’t see your telehealth provider in person?Khan: Let’s say a telemedicine physician practices completely remotely — then the patient would discuss with them what next steps would be.In the proposed rule, the qualifying telemedicine referral may allow a patient to be seen by a local DEA-registered practitioner. So, for example, perhaps their primary care doctor or pediatrician — if they are DEA-registered — might be able to go through the qualifying telemedicine referral process so that they can see them in person and continue to be prescribed the medicine. Or patients can contact their health insurance provider to get a list of local referrals.CNN: Are there any drawbacks to seeing general physicians or pediatricians for controlled medication prescriptions?Khan: Some may say they aren’t going to prescribe certain medications, like psychiatric medications. Some may say they are comfortable with it, and some may say they will prescribe for a short period of time until you connect with a specialist. So there is variability.CNN: Would the patient have to continue seeing the referral provider after that first in-person appointment?Khan: In terms of what’s required at the federal level, if a patient has that one in-person exam with a provider through that qualifying telemedicine referral process, they wouldn’t necessarily have to see that provider again unless that’s part of their treatment plan that’s discussed.With the qualifying telemedicine referral in the proposed rule, the way it’s written, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the referral practitioner prescribing the medicine; they just need to do the in-person exam. The referral practitioner can refer the patient back to the telemedicine doctor, who can prescribe the medicine.The other factor that’s significant here is we discussed all the proposed rules and the status at the federal level, but there’s also the state level. States also have rules around controlled medicine prescribing, and they may not always align with federal law. Let’s say the DEA puts out their final rule, and there’s some flexibility — some states might adopt the older Ryan Haight Act language from the federal level, so they might actually be stricter than what we’ll be seeing at the federal level. When federal and state laws don’t align, providers generally have to follow whatever is stricter.CNN: Will patients need to see their provider in person every time they need a prescription refill?Khan: The DEA has indicated that the absolute requirement at the federal level is one in-person examination. Beyond that, it would be left to the discretion of whoever the patient is seeing.",health,0.0

Evans Jr., the APA CEO.“We hope these recommendations will be helpful as we all try to keep pace with the rapidly shifting social media ecosystem,” he said.When it comes to teens, safety is something we need to do with them – not to them, said Damour, author of “The Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.”“I think this advisory gives parents a roadmap for the kind of helpful conversations they could be having with their teenagers about how to use social media safely,” she said.But how do you convince a teenager to get on board with safer social media use? It’s all about collaboration, Damour said.“It’s critically important that we help tweens and teens understand that social media platforms have a single aim, which is to harness their attention in the interest of making money,” she said. “We have excellent research showing that when teens are alerted to how they’re being manipulated by adults, they become more resistant.”It’s the job of adults to keep up with teens social media practices to make sure the content they are seeing on these platforms is appropriate, she added. Social media feeds can push dangerous content, so it is important to know what you need to talk with your teen about.“We want as adults to be very aware of the content and norms in the digital environments where kids are spending time,” Damour said.Teens are experiencing much of their social life on social media, and rather than shame it, we should collaborate with the younger generation, she said.“Rather than being against social media, the advisory supports parents and being for the activities that we know promote healthy growth and kids,” Damour added.",health,0.0
892,918,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/health/fda-otc-birth-control-pill/index.html,"As FDA advisers consider OTC birth-control pill, agency scientists worry it won’t work due to women’s weight and likelihood of following label",2023-05-10 12:00:00,"When Caitlyn Pace moved from the United States to Hong Kong three years ago to take a teaching job, she loved the food, the sights and the birth control.She was was pleasantly surprised to find that in Hong Kong, she could get oral contraceptives at her neighborhood drugstore without a prescription.“My jaw probably dropped the first time I did it. I just walked in and kind of looked around and was like ‘is this really happening?’ ” said Pace, 34. “It’s like buying aspirin.”For years, medical organizations have fought to have over-the-counter birth control pills in the US, too.On Tuesday and Wednesday, a group of external advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration will discuss an application from a pharmaceutical company to put their prescription birth control pill over-the-counter.Although professional organizations including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support over-the-counter sales of the drug, called Opill, the FDA seems skeptical, citing a list of concerns in a 130-page document posted online Friday.“I am worried” about the FDA’s decision, said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.The FDA scientists say they have two main concerns about Opill, a “mini pill” that uses only the hormone progestin.One has to do with obesity. The FDA approved Opill as a prescription drug in 1973, and “the prevalence of obesity in adults in the United States has changed dramatically since the original clinical studies were conducted over 50 years ago,” the scientists wrote in the document, citing a 13% obesity rate in 1960 compared with a 42% obesity rate now.“The degree to which efficacy of [Opill] is diminished in individuals who are overweight or obese (which together now represent approximately 60% of the U.S. reproductive-aged population … ) remains unknown,” they added.The agency cited a 2016 report analyzing data from four studies that suggested women who were obese had an increased risk of pregnancy after taking emergency contraception. The data in those four studies was “limited and poor to fair quality,” the authors wrote.Brandi said she was surprised by the FDA’s statements.In a practice document for its members, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists cites several studies showing that “women with obesity can be offered all hormonal contraceptive method options with reassurance that the efficacy of hormonal contraception is not significantly affected by weight.”Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist in New Jersey, noted that even though obesity has been on the rise, there has not been a higher rate of failure for birth control pills.The FDA scientists were also concerned that studies by Perrigo, the company that manufactures Opill, showed some women didn’t follow the label instructions. They said some women in the study didn’t take the pill within the same three-hour window every day, which is important for efficacy.But Brandi said even when doctors prescribe pills, patients don’t always take them properly all the time.“They make mistakes, and we know that,” she said. “People are humans, and that’s OK.”The Opill label tells women that if they’re more than three hours late taking their pill, they should take a pill as soon as they remember and use an additional form of birth control, such as a condom, for two days.“I trust patients that they’ll be able to read the instructions and follow the instructions and be able to use the medication safely and effectively,” Brandi said. “I don’t worry, because I trust women. I trust my patients.”In a statement, Perrigo said that “data from our eight year development program show that consumers can use Opill safely and effectively as guided by the proposed labelling.”The FDA also expressed concern that without counseling from a doctor, women might not realize when Opill wasn’t appropriate for them.For example, the Opill label states that the drug should not be used by women with a history of breast cancer. But when 205 study subjects with a history of breast cancer read the label, six of them said the pill was right for them.Women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding also are not supposed to use Opill, but in a study, more than half of those with this condition said the pill was appropriate for them.The FDA is under pressure to allow Opill to go over-the-counter from elected officials as well as health-care providers.Unwanted pregnancies are a public health issue in the US, where almost half of all pregnancies are unintended, according to the FDA briefing document, and rates are especially high among lower-income women, Black women and those who haven’t completed high school.In March 2022, 59 members of Congress wrote a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf about OTC contraception.“This is a critical issue for reproductive health, rights, and justice. Despite decades of proven safety and effectiveness, people still face immense barriers to getting birth control due to systemic inequities in our healthcare system,” the lawmakers wrote.Califf responded that the FDA “acknowledges the public health benefits of increased access to oral contraceptives” and that “the Agency’s decision making is guided by the best available science.”The FDA advisers are expected to vote Wednesday on whether to recommend that the agency approve Opill going over-the-counter. The agency often follows the recommendations of its advisers but doesn’t always do so.",health,0.0
894,920,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/health/world-lupus-day-iyw-wellness/index.html,"Lupus is a mysterious, brutal disease. Here’s how you can join the fight against it",2023-05-10 10:07:00,"May 10 is World Lupus Day, an annual global event spotlighting the complex disease and ways to improve quality of life for those suffering from it.Lupus is an autoimmune disease; the body’s immune system attacks healthy cells leading to pain, fever, rashes, organ damage and other symptoms. The Lupus Foundation of America estimates more than 5 million people live with the condition which affects each person differently, making lupus difficult to treat and particularly hard to diagnose.“Research has shown that it can take an average of six years to diagnose lupus from the time someone starts experiencing symptoms,” said Mary Crimmings, interim CEO of the Lupus Foundation of America (LFA).These delays can bring devastating consequences for patients. Since there’s currently no cure for lupus, researchers, advocates, and patients are banding together to improve healthcare services and research into the disease.Lupus can be managed once it’s identified. But treatment remains challenging. Over the last seven decades, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved just three therapies specifically for lupus.Many patients take chemotherapy and antimalarial medications off-label to control symptoms, often with serious side effects.Lupus drug development lags compared to other therapies primarily because of the disease’s unique complexity and variation.“There are issues in clinical trial design outcome measures, and the community realizes that these are challenges that not one group can solve,” said Hoang Nguyen, Ph.D from Lupus Research Alliance (LRA). “It requires all the stakeholders, including the FDA, to come together.”The FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has partnered with the Lupus Research Alliance (LRA) to launch the Lupus Accelerating Breakthroughs Consortium (Lupus ABC), a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership focused on addressing difficulties with lupus clinical trials and accelerating therapy development.To address scientific difficulties facing drug research, Lupus ABC brings together medical societies, academics, clinicians, the FDA, and – most importantly– people living with lupus.“The major goal of the consortium is to bring the voice of people with lupus to the forefront,” said Nguyen.The input of lupus sufferers is essential for patients like Kaamilah Gilyard, who has participated in four clinical trials.“This is a big step in the right direction, and I hope things will move faster,” said Gilyard.“The more people support research for the disease, the better the arsenal of effective treatments that will become available,” added Crimmings.CNN’s Impact Your World has gathered ways you can help support lupus patients and the race for the cure.Educate yourself“You don’t look sick.” That statement, though often intended as a compliment, can feel extremely insensitive and dismissive to people dealing with the condition.“Don’t always tell me I’m looking great because inside, my body is feeling like crap. My body is destroying itself,” said Racquel Dozier, lupus warrior and founder of Lupus in Color, an international support group empowering lupus patients.“It leaves people feeling misunderstood and isolated,” explained Crimmings, “and sometimes it feels like people don’t believe they are actually ill.”Lupus is often called an “invisible illness” because symptoms are not outwardly obvious. But it’s important to remember that while someone may appear fine on the outside, they may be dealing with painful, chronic and even life-threatening circumstances.The best way to avoid committing this offense is to educate yourself. LFA’s National Resource Center on Lupus has a wealth of educational content from doctors, scientists, health educators, and people with lupus.Raise awareness“The more awareness there is about the devastating impact of lupus, the more support there will be for funding lupus research, education and support programs,” Crimmings told CNN.Most people don’t know what lupus is or how it affects the body, and you can change that using your voice person-to-person or through social media. LFA is campaigning to make lupus visible, and you can help using their toolkit and your social media accounts to spread awareness.You can also post a photo of yourself wearing purple on social media with #LupasAwarenessMonth and #WorldLupusDay along with a brief reason why you support the cause.There’s also the Team Make Your Mark™ Virtual 6 Challenge. Between June 23 and June 28, you can run, hike, bike, paddle or swim in any location for 6 days to raise awareness and funds to fight lupus.Become an advocateAdvocates work for all people with lupus, their families, and the health professionals who care for them. They educate government officials and industry leaders on expanding investment in lupus research, education programs, and support services.Most advocacy around lupus focuses on stimulating federal support for treatment, research and, ultimately, a cure. The latest push resulted in the Lupus ABC partnership with the LRA and the FDA.Gilyard, who was diagnosed  with lupus at 17, is determined to change the lives of future generations living with lupus.“When I was diagnosed, I had no role model, no one to call, nowhere to look.”Much of Gilyard’s advocacy centers around engaging her community to participate in lupus research, to help overcome the lack of diversity in trials and to promote  equity in healthcare among populations of color.“I like to speak to people, and I like to clear the air and address the issues from a grassroots perspective,” Gilyard expounded.“I want people to have options when I felt like I had none.”Your voice can be an asset too. Meet with, email, or tweet your elected officials and tell them about the important lupus policy issues. If you or someone you love has lupus, share your story; it could help save lives.VolunteerRacquel Dozier knows the power of volunteering. After being permanently disabled by lupus in her 30’s, she fell into a spiral.“It had to become an inside job to change the feelings of pain, sorrow, and guilt that I had because I had to stop working.”The Henrico County, Virginia resident searched for a support group but struggled to find one with patients who looked like her.“I decided to start Lupus in Color to make sure that Black women were represented and so that I could help others – and we can help each other,” Dozier told CNN.The former social worker and educator now harnesses many of the skills from her former career.“I took all the skills I learned through college and work experience, and I use all of it through Lupus in Color,” Dozier said.“I’m still working; I’m just not getting the dollars.”Crimmings suggest those interested in volunteering contact a local lupus charity and share their skillset to see how to help. There are opportunities ranging from clerical work to support groups to organizing events.Make a donationWe all know how crucial funding is regarding research, but little is said about patients’ financial burdens.“Lupus can have a significant economic impact,” shared Crimmings.“Many people don’t realize that people with lupus are having infusions or may be on dialysis for kidney disease, and sometimes people are unable to work,” Crimmings said. A recent study in the Journal of Rheumatology revealed a high cost for people with severe lupus ($52,951 average per year), compared with moderate disease ($28,936) and mild disease ($21,052). For the underinsured, this can be a substantial financial burden that discourages some people from seeking treatment.Organizations like Patient Advocate Foundation and the Healthwell Foundation are helping patients bear the costs. Unfortunately, Healthwell’s fund specifically for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus had to close to new applicants because of insufficient funding.Participating in a walk, whether alone or as part of a group, is a fun way to help fund important research. Both LFA  and LRA sponsor walks throughout the year.“Lupus is more pervasive than people think and impacts people on a scale that the public does not realize,” said Crimmings.Click the button below to donate to any of the organizations mentioned above and others supporting patients living with lupus.",health,0.0
895,921,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/10/health/legal-pot-partner-kff-health-news/index.html,Regulators struggle to keep up as pot becomes more potent – and more dangerous,2023-05-10 06:43:00,"Marijuana and other products containing THC, the plant’s main psychoactive ingredient, have grown more potent and more dangerous as legalization has made them more widely available.Although decades ago the THC content of weed was commonly less than 1.5%, some products on the market today are more than 90% THC.The buzz of yesteryear has given way to something more alarming. Marijuana-related medical emergencies have landed hundreds of thousands of people in the hospital and millions are dealing with psychological disorders linked to cannabis use, according to federal research.But regulators have failed to keep up.Among states that allow the sale and use of marijuana and its derivatives, consumer protections are spotty.“In many states the products come with a warning label and potentially no other activity by regulators,” said Cassin Coleman, vice chair of the scientific advisory committee of the National Cannabis Industry Association.The federal government has generally taken a hands-off approach. It still bans marijuana as a Schedule 1 substance — as a drug with no accepted medical use and a high chance of abuse — under the Controlled Substances Act. But when it comes to cannabis sales, which many states have legalized, the federal government does not regulate attributes like purity or potency.The FDA “has basically sat on its hands and failed to honor its duty to protect the public health,” said Eric Lindblom, a scholar at Georgetown University’s law school who previously worked at the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.Pot has changed profoundly since generations of Americans were first exposed to it.Cannabis has been cultivated to deliver much higher doses of THC. In 1980, the THC content of confiscated marijuana was less than 1.5%. Today many varieties of cannabis flower — plant matter that can be smoked in a joint — are listed as more than 30% THC.At one California dispensary, the menu recently included a strain posted as 41% THC.Legalization has also helped open the door to products that are extracted from marijuana but look nothing like it: oily, waxy, or crystalline THC concentrates that are heated and inhaled through vaping or dabbing, which can involve a bong-like device and a blowtorch.Today’s concentrates can be more than 90% THC. Some are billed as almost pure THC.Few people personify the mainstreaming of marijuana as vividly as John Boehner, the former U.S. House speaker. The Ohio Republican long opposed marijuana and, in 2011, reportedly declared himself “unalterably opposed” to its legalization.Now he’s on the board of Acreage Holdings, a producer of marijuana products.And Acreage Holdings illustrates the evolution of the industry. Its Superflux brand markets a vaping product — “pure live resin in a convenient, instant format” — and concentrates such as “budder,” “sugar,” “shatter,” and “wax.” The company bills its “THCa crystalline” concentrate as the “ultimate in potency.”Higher concentrations pose greater hazards, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “The risks of physical dependence and addiction increase with exposure to high concentrations of THC, and higher doses of THC are more likely to produce anxiety, agitation, paranoia, and psychosis,” its website said.In 2021, 16.3 million people in the United States — 5.8% of people 12 or older — had experienced a marijuana use disorder within the past year, according to a survey published in January by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.That was far more than the combined total found to have substance use disorders involving cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, prescription stimulants such as Adderall, or prescription pain relievers such as fentanyl and OxyContin.Other drugs are more dangerous than marijuana, and most of the people with a marijuana use disorder had a mild case. But about 1 in 7 — more than 2.6 million people — had a severe case, the federal survey found.Most clinicians equate the term “severe use disorder” with addiction, said Wilson Compton, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.Cannabis use disorder “can be devastating,” said Smita Das, a Stanford psychiatrist and chair of an American Psychiatric Association council on addiction.Das said she has seen lives upended by cannabis — very successful people who have lost families and jobs. “They’re in a place where they don’t know how they got there because it was just a joint, it was just cannabis, cannabis wasn’t supposed to be addictive for them,” Das said.Medical diagnoses attributed to marijuana include “cannabis dependence with psychotic disorder with delusions” and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, a form of persistent vomiting.An estimated 800,000 people made marijuana-related emergency department visits in 2021, according to a government study published in December 2022.A Colorado father thought it was just a matter of time before cannabis killed his son.In spring 2021, the teen ran a red light, crashed into another car — injuring himself and the other driver — and fled the scene, the father recalled in interviews.In the wreckage, the father later found joints, empty containers of a high-potency THC concentrate known as wax, and a THC vape pen.On his son’s cellphone, he found text messages and scores of references to dabbing and weed. The teen said he had been dabbing before the crash and had intended to kill himself.Weeks later, police arranged for him to be held involuntarily at a hospital for psychiatric evaluation. According to a police report, he thought cartel snipers were after him.The doctor who evaluated the teen diagnosed “cannabis abuse.”“Stop doing dabs or wax as they can make you extremely paranoid,” the doctor wrote. “Go directly to the detox program of your choice.”By the father’s account, over the past two years the teen logged several other involuntary holds, dozens of encounters with police, repeated jailings, and a series of stays in inpatient treatment facilities.At times out of touch with reality, he texted that God spoke to him and gave him superpowers.The damage was also financial. Health insurance claims for his treatment totaled nearly $600,000, and the family’s out-of-pocket expenses came to almost $40,000 as of February.In interviews for this article, the father spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid undermining the son’s recovery.The father is convinced that his son’s mental illness was a result and not a cause of the drug use. He said the symptoms receded when his son stopped using THC and returned when he resumed.His son is now 20, off marijuana, and doing well, the father said, adding, “I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that cannabis use is what caused his psychosis, delusions, and paranoia.”Medical use of marijuana is now legal in 40 states and the District of Columbia, and recreational or adult use is legal in 22 states plus D.C., according to MJBizDaily, a trade publication.Early in the covid-19 pandemic, while much of America was in lockdown, marijuana dispensaries delivered. Many states declared them essential businesses.But only two adult-use states, Vermont and Connecticut, have placed caps on THC content — 30% for cannabis flower and 60% for THC concentrates — and they exempt pre-filled vape cartridges from the caps, said Gillian Schauer from the Cannabis Regulators Association, a group of state regulators.Some states cap the number of ounces or grams consumers are allowed to buy. However, even a little marijuana can amount to a lot of THC, said Rosalie Liccardo Pacula, a professor of health policy, economics, and law at the University of Southern California.Some states allow only medical use of low-THC products — for instance, in Texas, substances that contain no more than 0.5% THC by weight. And some states require warning labels. In New Jersey, cannabis products composed of more than 40% THC must declare: “This is a high potency product and may increase your risk for psychosis.”Colorado’s marijuana rules run more than 500 pages. Yet its disclosure underscores the limits of consumer protections: “This product was produced without regulatory oversight for health, safety, or efficacy.”Figuring out the right rules may not be simple. For example, warning labels could shield the marijuana industry from liability, much as they did for tobacco companies for many years. Capping potency could limit options for people who take high doses for relief from medical problems.Overall, at the state level, the cannabis industry has blunted regulatory efforts by arguing that onerous rules would make it hard for legitimate cannabis businesses to compete with illicit ones, Pacula said.Pacula and fellow researchers have called for the federal government to step in.Months after ending his term as FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb issued a similar plea.Complaining that states had gotten “far down the field while the feds sat on the sidelines,” Gottlieb called for “a uniform national scheme for THC that protects consumers.”That was in 2019 and little has changed since then.The FDA oversees food, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and medical devices. It regulates tobacco, nicotine, and nicotine vapes. It oversees tobacco warning labels. In the interest of public health and safety, it also regulates botanicals, medical products that can include plant material.Yet, when it comes to the marijuana that people smoke, the cannabis-derived THC concentrates they vape or dab, and edibles infused with THC, the FDA appears very much on the sidelines.The medical marijuana sold at dispensaries is not FDA-approved. The agency hasn’t vouched for its safety or efficacy or determined the proper dosage. It doesn’t inspect the facilities where the goods are produced, and it doesn’t assess quality control.The agency does invite manufacturers to put cannabis products through clinical trials and its drug approval process.The FDA’s website notes that THC is the active ingredient in two FDA-approved drugs used in cancer treatment. That alone apparently places the substance under FDA jurisdiction.The FDA has “all the power it needs to regulate state-legalized cannabis products much more effectively,” said Lindblom, the former FDA official.At least publicly, the FDA has focused not on THC concentrates derived from cannabis or weed smoked in joints, but rather on other substances: a THC variant derived from hemp, which the federal government has legalized, and a different cannabis derivative called cannabidiol or CBD, which has been marketed as therapeutic.“The FDA is committed to monitoring the marketplace, identifying cannabis products that pose risks, and acting, within our authorities, to protect the public,” FDA spokesperson Courtney Rhodes said.“Many/most THC products meet the definition of marijuana, which is a controlled substance. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulates marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act. We refer you to the Drug Enforcement Administration for questions about regulation and enforcement under the provisions of the CSA,” Rhodes wrote in an email.The DEA, part of the Justice Department, did not respond to questions for this article.As for Congress, perhaps its most consequential step has been limiting enforcement of the federal prohibition.“Thus far, the federal response to state actions to legalize marijuana has largely been to allow states to implement their own laws on the drug,” a 2022 Congressional Research Service report said.In October, President Joe Biden directed the secretary of Health and Human Services and the attorney general to review the federal government’s stance toward marijuana — whether it should remain classified among the most dangerous and tightly controlled substances.In December, Biden signed a bill expanding research access to marijuana and requiring federal agencies to study its effects. The law gave agencies a year to issue findings.Some marijuana advocates say the federal government could play a more constructive role.“NORML does not opine that cannabis is innocuous, but opines that its potential risks are best mitigated via legalization, regulation, and public education,” said Paul Armentano, deputy director of the group formerly known as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.“Products have to be tested for purity and potency,” he said, and “the federal government could have some oversight in licensing the labs that test those products.”In the meantime, said Coleman, adviser to the National Cannabis Industry Association, states are left “having to become USDA + FDA + DEA all at the same time.”And where does that leave consumers? Some, like Wendy E., a retired small-business owner in her 60s, struggle with the effects of today’s marijuana.Wendy, who spoke on the condition that she not be fully named, started smoking marijuana in high school in the 1970s and made it part of her lifestyle for decades.Then when her state legalized it, she bought it in dispensaries “and very quickly noticed that the potency was much higher than what I had traditionally used,” she said. “It seemed to have exponentially increased.”In 2020, she said, the legal marijuana – much stronger than the illicit weed of her youth – left her obsessing about ways to kill herself.Once, the self-described “earth-mother hippie” found camaraderie passing a joint with friends.

My personal favorite cast member is Justin Cunningham, who plays Wyatt Fields, a married artist who is just the right amount of optimistic and persnickety. He also portrayed Kevin Richardson as an adult in the critically acclaimed Netflix miniseries, “When They See Us.”Check out “Grand Crew” when you can.My admiration for Paul Giamatti is in the “Billions.”Now that I’ve gotten that joke out of the way, my appreciation for Giamatti grew when I attended a recording of the actor’s podcast “Chinwag” while at SeriesFest.No spoilers since the episode hasn’t released yet, but Giamatti and his friend – philosopher and author Stephen Asma – have a blast on the pod delving into topics ranging from Hollywood to the extraterrestrial.I learned some wild things from the recording and bet many of you will too.“Black Knight”With the way the world is going, you wouldn’t think we need more dystopian dramas.But, personally, I think the genre can remind us that while things are bad, they aren’t that bad.Enter “Black Knight,” a series in which the Korean peninsula is a wasteland wrecked by pollution where only one percent of the population has survived. According to the show’s tagline, “the survival of humanity depends on the Black Knights — and they’re far from your average deliverymen.”I feel the tension already!The series starts streaming on Netflix Friday.“The Great” Season 3This one is a personal favorite.Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult shine as the stars of Hulu’s wildly inaccurate and deliciously scandalous historical dramedy, “The Great.” If you like your humor skewed toward inappropriate and don’t mind your history with a heavy dose of creativity, start with Season 1 and get to binging.The show returns Friday for Season 3",entertainment,0.0

In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone’s prayers and support!

898,924,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/entertainment/the-mother-review/index.html,Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck score a split decision with ‘The Mother’ and ‘Hypnotic’,2023-05-13 14:10:00,"One of Hollywood’s most famous power couples score a split decision starring in separate thrillers hitting the market the same day, as Ben Affleck’s lower-profile  “Hypnotic” significantly outshines Jennifer Lopez’s just-in-time-for-Mother’s Day Netflix movie, “The Mother,” which comes across as an ultra-violent Hallmark card.Lopez puts on her Liam Neeson hat in a movie whose abundant action is either enhanced or undermined, take your pick, by its unintentional giggles. The kill count generally provides the requisite thrills, but everything else seems stitched together from genre clichés.The opening sequence sets the tone, with Lopez portraying a well-trained sniper who served in Afghanistan, negotiating a witness-protection deal in exchange for her testimony against two very bad guys, having been in relationships with both of them. After a violent raid she’s taken into FBI custody, allowing Edie Falco to appear for about 45 seconds, just long enough to force the nameless assassin to give up her newborn daughter in order to protect her.Twelve years later, Lopez’s character is maintaining her anonymity by hanging out in the Alaskan wilderness when the girl, Zoe (Lucy Paez), has her cover blown, forcing her biological mom and an FBI agent (“Power’s” Omari Hardwick, like most of the supporting cast, deserving better) to dash off to retrieve her. They do, setting up a chance for mother and daughter to get to know each other – bonding between lessons in combat techniques – before the inevitable showdown.Directed by Niki Caro (“Mulan”), “The Mother” gives Lopez (who doubled as its producer) an opportunity to snap off tough one-liners a la “Taken.” Realizing the girl is serving as bait in a trap, her proposed solution is to “Kill every last one of them.”Joseph Fiennes and Gael Garcia Bernal can’t class up the joint as the bad boys from her past, who both excel at holding grudges. Yet beyond the inevitable tween-behaving-stupidly moments, there are head-scratching sequences, like a snowmobile chase that appears to have parachuted in from a James Bond movie.Lopez has kept busy since her critically lauded role in “Hustlers,” but that’s come in the form of mostly forgettable vehicles, including the rom-com “Marry Me” and “Shotgun Wedding.” While she has admirably taken control over her career as a producer, her sniper character’s aim is considerably truer than her recent choices of material.For Netflix, of course, just the image of Lopez across its home page – pointing a rifle under a big furry hat – is probably enough, and plenty of subscribers will likely be inclined to give “The Mother” a shot.At one point, the mother speaks of Zoe’s ordeal by saying, “Let this all just be a bad memory.” “The Mother” isn’t quite that bad, but that sentiment resonates a more than it should.Affleck fares considerably better in “Hypnotic,” a spare thriller from director/co-writer Robert Rodriguez that has the feel of a “Twilight Zone” episode, with no shortage of twists along the way.Affleck plays Danny Rourke, a detective still devastated by the abduction of his young daughter. A strange tip connects him back to the crime, and to a psychic (Alice Braga) who tells him seemingly unrelated crimes are the work of a powerful hypnotic (William Fichtner, appropriately creepy), who can exercise a kind of mind control, prompting people to carry out whatever acts he desires.There’s a lot more to it than that, including mind-bending visuals underscoring that it’s not always possible to believe your eyes against such an opponent. The sort-of possession involved evokes the Denzel Washington thriller “Fallen,” which had a more macabre tone but echoed the sense danger could come from anywhere.“Hypnotic” becomes a little strained over its final act, but for the most part it’s fast-paced and clever, capitalizing on Rodriguez’s economical filmmaking style, which includes shooting and editing the film while enlisting family members in other key roles.Although the movie is premiering theatrically, it’ll likely be streaming sooner than later, where it should play well.As for Affleck, he actually has his own directing effort, “Air,” hitting Amazon Prime after a solid theatrical run. If the combination makes this a big weekend in the Affleck-Lopez household, it’s a better one for the first half of that equation.“The Mother” premieres May 12 on Netflix. It’s rated R.“Hypnotic” premieres May 12 in US theaters. It’s rated R.",entertainment,0.0

That mystery book you’ve been preordering is actually by BTS",2023-05-12 10:43:00,"An unpublished, as-yet-untitled book by an unnamed author shot up the US bestseller lists this week, thanks to preorders from Taylor Swift fans who believed it to be her memoir.But sadly for Swifties, the book previously listed as “4C Untitled Flatiron Nonfiction Summer 2023” has now been named: “Beyond the Story: 10-Year Record of BTS,” written by the musical juggernaut themselves, K-pop superstars BTS, according to updated listings on some booksellers’ websites.Grammy-nominated BTS is one of the most successful boy bands in music history, with number 1 singles in more than 100 countries. In 2020, they were named Time Magazine’s Entertainer of the Year.The band – RM, Jin, V, J-Hope, Suga, Jimin and Jungkook – are currently taking a break to pursue solo careers, with some members enlisting or set to enlist for mandatory military service.BTS have written the memoir with journalist Myeongseok Kang. Flatiron Books, an imprint of Macmillan, will publish it on July 9.So what convinced Swift’s fans enough for them to fork out $45 on a mysterious 544-page hardback?It all comes down to numerology. First, the number of pages. When the individual digits in the number 544 are added together (5 + 4 + 4), the total is 13. In an appearance on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, “the “Shake It Off” singer confided that 13 was her lucky number.Earlier in the week, a document allegedly from Flatiron made its way across social media, indicating the book’s author would be revealed on June 13, which Swifties took to be a second clue.Next, the July 9 publication date is just two days after the release of Swift’s new album, “Speak Now (Taylor’s version).”In a recent Instagram post announcing the album, Swift highlighted the date, which keen-eyed fans interpreted as a reference to the book.“It fills me with such pride and joy to announce that my version of Speak Now will be out July 7 (just in time for July 9th, iykyk 😆),” Swift wrote cryptically.But both June 13 and July 9 are also of significance to the BTS community.The septet debuted their first single, “No More Dream,” on June 12, 2013, and the book’s July 9 release date similarly marks a 10-year anniversary, “ARMY Day,” celebrating the founding of the BTS fan group, known as the ARMY (Adorable Representative MC for Youth).Sorry, Swifties, but BTS and their loyal ARMY have won this one.",entertainment,0.0

902,928,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/entertainment/michael-j-fox-quit-acting-intl-scli/index.html,Michael J. Fox opens up about the moment he decided to retire,2023-05-12 08:04:00,"Michael J. Fox is getting candid about life with Parkinson’s disease, and the moment he decided to step away from acting for good.The “Back to the Future” star recalled that during filming for “The Good Fight,” a spin-off of legal drama “The Good Wife,” he couldn’t remember his lines – an incident that reminded him of a scene in Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”“I thought of ‘Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.’ There’s a scene where Leonardo DiCaprio’s character can’t remember his lines anymore. He goes back to his dressing room and he’s screaming at himself in the mirror. Just freaking insane,” Fox said in an interview with Empire. “I had this moment where I was looking in the mirror and thought, ‘I cannot remember it anymore.’”The star added that he dealt with the realization calmly, saying to himself: “‘Well, let’s move on.’ It was peaceful.”Fox, who rose to fame as Alex P. Keaton on the hit 1980s sitcom “Family Ties,” was diagnosed in 1991 with the incurable degenerative disease, which affects the nervous system and motor skills including walking and speech.The five-time Emmy Award-winning actor, who also has four Golden Globes, a Grammy and two Screen Actors Guild Awards, last month opened up to Jane Pauley for “CBS Sunday Morning” about how Parkinson’s “is the gift that keeps on taking.”“I’m not gonna lie. It’s getting harder,” Fox said, adding, “Every day it’s tougher.”His life with his family, and how living with Parkinson’s affects their day-to-day reality, will be covered in the new documentary “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie,” which lands on Apple TV+ on Friday.The actor explained in the CBS interview that he recently underwent spinal surgery for a benign tumor, and has suffered two broken arms, a broken hand and broken bones in his face as a result of falls.“(Falling) is a big killer with Parkinson’s,” Fox noted. “It’s falling, and aspirating food and pneumonia – all these subtle ways that (it) gets you. You don’t die from Parkinson’s. You die with Parkinson’s.”But the actor also mentioned that he’s been living with the disease for “30 plus years,” and that his “life is set up so that I can pack Parkinson’s along with me if I have to.”“I recognize how hard this is for people, and I recognize how hard it is for me, but I have a certain set of skills that allow me to deal with this stuff,” he told Pauley. “And I realize, with gratitude, optimism is sustainable.”“If you can find something to be grateful for, then you can find something to look forward to, and you carry on,” he said.Fox told Empire that he still has big plans following his retirement from acting – for one, he will be putting his efforts into the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, founded in 2000, where, he said, “there’s some really big stuff going on.”",entertainment,0.0

905,931,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/entertainment/ghosts-season-finale-review/index.html,‘Ghosts’ saves a cliffhanger and an heir-raising wrinkle for its season finale,2023-05-12 08:52:00,"“Ghosts” concluded its season with the smallest of cliffhangers, leaving the audience to dangle into the fall (and possibly beyond, depending on how long the writers strike drags on). Yet the finale more broadly underscored the growth of this very funny CBS comedy, which has joined ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” in helping breathe life (ironically, in this case) into the genre on the major networks.Adapted from a British series, “Ghosts” has become a hit for CBS practically from the get-go, creating a potent one-two punch with “Young Sheldon” on Thursday nights. Easily overlooked, though, in the show’s broadly comic elements, as it mixes ghosts from across decades and indeed centuries, is its underlying sweetness as those relationships have developed and evolved over two seasons.That aspect unfolded on two fronts in the season finale, which saw Isaac (Brandon Scott Jones), who was closeted when the series began, take the leap of proposing to his boyfriend Nigel (John Hartman); and Alberta (Danielle Pinnock) deal with her feelings of betrayal regarding Hetty (Rebecca Wisocky), who had hid the details of Alberta’s death from her for roughly a century.If that wasn’t enough, the great mansion’s living couple, Samantha (Rose McIver) and Jay (Utkarsh Ambudkar), nearly had the house scammed away from them by a woman claiming to have an ancestral right to the estate.The prospect of losing the property prompted a wistful Sam to remember all the good memories they had amassed there, before the cliffhanging moment: A blinding light suggesting one of the ghosts, identity unknown, had been sucked off to Heaven. (The terminology remains a small triumph for the writers over the network’s standards-and-practices department.)Granted, the question of who was taken probably won’t amount to much in terms of the core cast, but simply as a practical matter, letting the audience ponder what happened during the show’s potentially more-extended-than-usual hiatus certainly isn’t a bad idea.Although the show employs a single-camera format, “Ghosts” possesses all the virtues of an old-style ensemble sitcom, with the added benefit of being able to weave in new characters and issue callbacks involving older ones, like this season’s encore appearance by Hetty’s detestable husband.Genuine hits on broadcast television have become particularly rare in the streaming era, especially in terms of shows that bend the cookie-cutter mold of franchise-able drama series. In that sense, “Ghosts” seems underappreciated, though to be fair, having a cast this big and talented works against it in terms of individual accolades.CBS, however, knows a hit when it sees one. Given that, whatever the resolution of the cliffhanger, if the network has its way “Ghosts” won’t be heading into the light anytime soon.",entertainment,0.0
911,937,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/entertainment/summer-movie-preview-2023/index.html,The summer movies looking to recapture that blockbuster magic you remember,2023-05-06 16:34:00,"Most moviegoers can pinpoint one summer movie – or perhaps, a summer of movies – in their formative years that really and truly cemented their love for going to the cinema, whether it be 1975’s “Jaws,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” from 1982, or “Independence Day” in 1996.Sure, a lot has happened since those golden years of the bustling multiplex – most notably the streaming revolution, not to mention a multi-year pandemic – but studio heads at last week’s CinemaCon (the annual convention where Hollywood shows theater owners what they have in store for the coming year) were quick to thump their chests and say, “Movies are back!”For proof, one need only look at this year’s billion-dollar-grossing “Super Mario Bros. Movie” (not to mention last year’s “Avatar” sequel) to see that theatrical movies, as it were, never really left. And while streaming has clearly siphoned off part of the audience, particularly for more serious films, what we think of as “summer movies” still have the potential to rake in cash just like the old days.With that said, at this juncture just ahead of the summer months, behold the list of flicks releasing “only in theaters” that are hoping to do exactly that, in order of release date:What better way to kick off summer than with the gang of Marvel-ous misfits known as the Guardians of the Galaxy? After many delays and back-and-forths with director James Gunn, the franchise-closing third installment of the trilogy is finally here, and it’s said to pack an emotional wallop, according to CNN’s critic Brian Lowry. In addition to the comic antics and the eye-popping visuals, a “Guardians” movie always delivers when it comes to a throwback soundtrack, so get ready.The gang is back for, yes, a tenth time, and while some are content to amuse themselves with how the “Fast and Furious” filmmakers come up with all the artful titles for all these endless sequels, others are here for the cars. This installment, welcoming back franchise regulars Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris, will welcome Jason Momoa and Academy Award-winners Rita Moreno and Brie Larson into the furious fold. Jason Statham, John Cena and more Oscar-winners Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron also return from previous fast and furious forays.The buzz for this latest Disney live-action “reimagining” has been bubbling for quite awhile as more is unveiled, but those faithful to the Oscar-winning 1989 animated classic have yet to deliver their final verdict. One thing’s for sure though – droves will likely go and see it, kids in tow, to decide if they want to make this new film part of their world.A sequel to one of the most inventive animated films of the new millennium, this follow-up to 2018’s Oscar-winning “Into the Spider-Verse” has the potential to raise the bar even higher as the story of Miles Morales – a counterpart to Peter Parker and Spider-Man all his own – is expanded even further, with Spider-Gwen’s help.After an impressive, franchise-launching first film in 2007 starring Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, many of the sequels in this film series based on the iconic toys have been rather dense and hard to follow, save for the spirited spinoff “Bumblebee” from 2018 starring Hailee Steinfeld. One only hopes this one, featuring animal-like Transformers known as Maximals, doesn’t run too long, and makes even the tiniest bit of sense.This one just might be the one to beat this summer, with DC bringing its universe of superheroes to an emotional and action-packed crescendo, deftly led by embattled star Ezra Miller’s super-fast Flash. The movie, previewed for attendees at last month’s CinemaCon, has more that a few incredible reveals up its sleeve that are sure to make waves, with high hopes that “The Flash” is a mainstay blockbuster throughout much of the season. (CNN and DC are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)While a cool summer movie would be an AI-generated “Star Wars” film as directed by Wes Anderson, nothing comes close the actual work of the real auteur, who takes on a bit of the sci-fi genre in his latest film “Asteroid City.” Boasting a per-usual incredible and starry cast along with trademark Anderson-esque visual splendor, the film follows stargazers who are visited by aliens in a place in the desert called, you guessed it, Asteroid City. Expect very low-key high jinks to ensue.Directed by the accomplished Tim Story, this trope-busting slasher comedy-horror hybrid looks like it will be a crowd-pleaser and then some, featuring an all-Black cast and hinging on the premise that since they’re all Black, as the tag line says, “We can’t all die first.” Among many other talents, look for “Insecure’s” Yvonne Orji and “Saturday Night Live” alum Jay Pharoah.Fire and water do indeed mix in this original story from Pixar, featuring a world in which the elements must learn to live together in the same crowded urban environment. Featuring the voices of many up-and-coming stars, the hope here is that the allegory for race relations veers more toward subtlety than heavy-handedness.For those truly looking to recreate the nostalgia of summer movies past, look no further than this fifth adventure from Indy (Harrison Ford), although for the first time, Steven Spielberg (still an executive producer) passes the director reins to James Mangold (of “Logan” and “Ford v. Ferrari”). The film brings back John Rhys-Davies of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” fame, and also welcomes “Fleabag” star Phoebe Waller-Bridge and “Logan’s” Boyd Holbrook along for the ride. The bar has been set rather low after the misfire that was “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” in 2008, so Indiana and co. have nowhere to go but up.This uproarious looking movie takes the girls’ trip idea made famous and successful by movies like “Bridesmaids” and “Girls Trip,” this time telling the story from an Asian American perspective, letting a quartet of gifted actresses – including “Emily in Paris” standout Ashley Park and brilliant Oscar nominee Stephanie Hsu from “Everything Everywhere All at Once” – have what looks to be the best and wildest time ever.‘Savior of the movies’ Tom Cruise is back again as Ethan Hunt, faced with yet another impossible task that, somehow, we know he’ll pull off. Let’s just hope the movie isn’t as dense, or as long, as the title.Another one that looks like a surefire hit, everything that comes out about “Barbie” ahead of the film’s release just makes everyone even more excited, including Ryan Gosling’s hilarious observations on harnessing his “Ken-ergy” at CinemaCon. The movie’s tongue-in-plastic-cheek feel surely has much to do with its director and co-writer Greta Gerwig, creator of “Lady Bird,” who was clearly an unorthodox but refreshing choice to helm this Mattel-themed excursion.For those who rolled their eyes at the previous entry on “Barbie,” head on over to the theater next door for this very serious film from the very serious Christopher Nolan, who promised attendees at this year’s CinemaCon that the movie – about the inventor of the atomic bomb – captures the life and times of “the most important person who ever lived.” Like I said, serious. Cillian Murphy stars.Not content just to keep updating their animated movies with live-action versions, Disney is also continuing its let’s-turn-our-theme-park-rides-into-movies tradition, after the uber-successful “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise and somewhat less-explosive “Jungle Cruise” from 2021. This adaptation follows a 2003 version with Eddie Murphy.For those looking to get their creature feature needs met this summer, look no further than “The Meg 2,” which will hopefully improve upon the strangely lackluster first film from 2018 about an insanely large prehistoric shark (read: megalodon) who is back for a second course (along with bristling hero Jason Statham).Surely looking to build on the hype (and big bucks) of the “Mario” movie, this flick based on the auto racing game had a little more work cut out for it, as star David Harbour pointed out at CinemaCon when he observed that the game is essentially a racing simulator and that there was no real storyline to work with. Enter Jann Mardenborough, a real-life Gran Turismo player portrayed in the new film by “Beau is Afraid” star Archie Madekwe, whose video game-playing skills landed him a shot to become an actual professional race car driver.Initially meant for streaming platforms, this vehicle will herald the cinematic arrival of DC Studios’ first Latino superhero, played by Xolo Maridueña of “Cobra Kai” and “Parenthood” fame. If the fast-paced trailer is any indication, the movie looks sure to whisk those dog days of summer doldrums away quite nicely.",entertainment,0.0

Fox Movie’ blends his life and career to go back to the future,2023-05-12 09:36:00,"“STILL: A Michael J. Fox Movie” is a remarkable accomplishment, making brilliant use of film clips to seamlessly illustrate and augment reenactments and the actor’s narration of his story, having spent more than 30 years living with Parkinson’s disease. Nostalgic without becoming overly sentimental, it’s an ode to Fox’s life, career and the struggle he continues to endure.In some respects, the documentary dovetails with “Val,” another biography about an actor grappling with health issues, although that drew heavily on Val Kilmer’s penchant for toting a video camera around with him to chronicle his life.Here, director Davis Guggenheim (“An Inconvenient Truth”) provides an equally intimate but more cinematic effect by combining Fox’s direct-to-camera interviews and narration culled from his book with understated reenactments and clips that cleverly capture key moments. When Fox discusses his insane schedule as he shuttled between his hit sitcom “Family Ties” and shooting “Back to the Future,” for example, there’s a clip of someone asking his character, “Do you think you can handle both jobs?”Fox refers to his first brush with tremors as “a message from the future,” before flashing back to his early life. Growing up far from the spotlight, he took the plunge and headed to Hollywood (to the strains of the Kenny Loggins song “This is It”) to pursue acting, capitalizing on his diminutive size and a youthful appearance that allowed him to still play kids when in high school.The breakthrough role on “Family Ties” came despite resistance from NBC’s then-president, the legendary Brandon Tartikoff, who is shown saying of Fox, “I don’t think we’re talking about somebody who’s going to be on a lunchbox.” Tartikoff later shows off an autographed lunchbox, embossed with Fox’s picture, that the actor sent him once the show became a smash hit.Having become an advocate for Parkinson’s research and funding, Fox matter-of-factly discusses his limitations, the unlikelihood of him living another 20 years and perhaps most poignantly, his lonely efforts to hide his condition, up to his time on the sitcom “Spin City.”Guggenheim deftly peppers the documentary with everything from behind-the-scenes glimpses of “Family Ties” to reviews of Fox’s movies – pro and con – by “Siskel & Ebert” to a montage of sequences in which he’s running, tying in with his observation, “I couldn’t be still until I could literally no longer keep still.”As Fox freely admits, the diagnosis initially shook him, leading to alcohol and other coping mechanisms. Yet he discusses it in the interviews with humor and nary a trace of self-pity, as the camera zeroes in on the challenges posed by even the smallest chores.“My world is getting smaller,” Fox says, by way of his decision to participate in this documentary now, though thanks to his wife and children, there’s no shortage of love or warmth to be found. And in terms of serving as a source of inspiration in terms of dealing with the bad hand that he was dealt, this “Michael J. Fox Movie” makes him look 10-feet tall.“STILL: A Michael J.

930,956,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/25/entertainment/fatal-attraction-review/index.html,‘Fatal Attraction’ doesn’t come close to the original with series reboot,"04:26 PM, Sun May 14, 2023","“Fatal Attraction” was very much a product of its time, so an attempt to cash in on the title – as Paramount+ does with a new version – absolutely needed to reconsider and reimagine the material. Yet the eight-part series awkwardly draped over its bones is a beyond-busy murder mystery, one that – with apologies to one of the film’s signature lines – can easily be ignored.As it happens, “Fatal Attraction” arrives the same week another streaming show with a very similar framework, “Saint X,” makes its debut on Hulu. Both jump around in time, hinge on the mysterious death of a young woman and build, too slowly, toward revealing what really happened, relying on an abundance of twists to tease out the story.The former starts with one of the most popular movies of the late 1980s, which famously scared men about infidelity thanks to Glenn Close’s alluring and then obsessed and increasingly dangerous stalker, mixing eroticism, horror and no small amount of sexism, with a memorable pinch of animal cruelty for good measure.The series updates that artifact in a number of ways – a few of them logical, one (yes) having to do with a bunny, but most merely perplexing. Specifically, it begins with Dan Gallagher (Joshua Jackson), a Los Angeles prosecutor, doing time for the murder of Alex Forrest (Lizzy Caplan), a co-worker with whom he had engaged in a steamy affair before things went very, very sideways.Relying primarily on hairstyles to designate the 15-year gap as it oscillates between then and now, the show begins with Dan being passed over for a promotion – he thinks he’s a lock to become a judge – which, as constructed, puts him in the mindset to risk his life with his wife, Beth (Amanda Peet), and their young daughter Ellen (Vivien Lyra Blair, recently seen in “Obi-Wan Kenobi”) by stepping out with Alex when the two are away.Flash forward, and Dan is just getting out of prison, said daughter is now a young woman (played at that age by Alyssa Jirrels) wrestling with her family history, and Beth has moved on. Meanwhile, Dan and his pal Mike (Toby Huss) seek to reopen their investigation, trying to determine what really happened to Alex and potentially clear his name.Executive producer Alexandra Cunningham (“Dirty John”) capitalizes on the more-expansive format to flesh out a lot of details, more organically developing the relationship and Alex’s side of the story as well as her past. The series also still weaves in touches that defined the movie, from Alex and Dan’s trysts to her famous warning, “I’m not going to be ignored.”Still, the understandable attempt to bring “Fatal Attraction” into the 2020s – as Paramount recently did, more successfully, with “Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies” – feels more tortured than most reboots (see the recent “Dead Ringers” as another example), padding on new characters and improbable wrinkles.Perhaps foremost, it takes what feels like an awfully long time to get to the not-terribly-satisfying payoff, despite solid work by Jackson and Caplan, who were both better served by the erotic series “The Affair” and “Masters of Sex,” respectively.In the original, Alex told Dan as the sexual tension built between them, “You’re here with a strange girl being a naughty boy.” There’s still some naughtiness in this incarnation, but it’s more guilty of being a boring boy than anything else.The same criticisms largely apply to “Saint X,” an adaptation of Alexis Schaitkin’s novel, which begins with the promising premise of how a “missing White woman” story unfolded, reflecting the media fascination with such tales and the toll on those swept up in its orbit.Specifically, that includes guests and staff at the Caribbean resort where college-student Alison (West Duchovny, David Duchovny and Téa Leoni’s daughter) went missing, and particularly the lingering effects on her much-younger sister, Emily, who as an adult (played by “Fear the Walking Dead’s” Alicia Debnam-Carey) begins nosing around for answers as to what really transpired.Loosely inspired by the Natalee Holloway case, the issues of class and race – illustrated through the prism of two hotel employees, well played by Josh Bonzie and Jayden Elijah – feel overwhelmed here by the emphasis on Emily’s ill-advised attempt to play Nancy Drew; Alison’s “stupid tourist” behavior, despite her protestations to the contrary; and an ending that doesn’t justify the trip.Complaining that such mystery series meander too much has become a familiar gripe, but that doesn’t make it any less true. Like “The White Lotus,” “Saint X” sets up provocative upstairs/downstairs themes in an inviting location, but unlike that HBO show, it’s a relatively poor destination for an eight-episode stay.“Fatal Attraction” premieres April 30 on Paramount+.“Saint X” premieres April 26 on Hulu.",entertainment,0.0
945,971,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/elizabeth-siddal-tate-britain-untold-art-history/index.html,She was a ‘supermodel’ of the Pre-Raphaelite period. Now art historians are rethinking her life,2023-05-08 15:09:00,"Even if you’re not familiar with Elizabeth Siddal, you likely know the 19th-century paintings she modeled for, artworks in which she slipped into others’ tragedies.There’s Siddal as Ophelia drowning in the lush riverbank among forget-me-nots, or as the poet Dante Alighieri’s dying beloved, glowing with the ecstasy of reverie. You’ve perhaps also heard the melancholic retellings of Siddal’s own arc: muse with a turbulent love life; fragile health; life cut short at 32 due to the opiate laudanum poisoning her blood.But you might not know Siddal’s own groundbreaking work as an artist and poet: her vibrant, emotionally expressive paintings, or her ballads of yearning. A new exhibition at the Tate Britain in London, “The Rossettis,” seeks, in part, to change that. The show, which focuses on Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who became her husband, his poet sister Christina, and Siddal, brings together more than 30 of Siddal’s works, the most seen together in 30 years.Siddal was the only woman to exhibit work with the short-lived but highly mythologized Pre-Raphaelite movement, which formed in 1848 and prized the period of 15th-century Italian artmaking that saw the medieval era give rise to the Renaissance. And though Siddal later became known for her modeling — for Rossetti, John Everett Millais and other artists — scholars and curators are shifting the attention to her rarely shown surviving art, which numbers some 60 works on paper and a handful of paintings. (Some of her lost works are shown for the first time at the Tate through photographs taken after her death).Tate curator Carol Jacobi says both the “physical fragility” and sparse number of works have led to few shows dedicated to Siddal. “But it is also the fact that she is very much eclipsed by the much more famous artists that were around her,” Jacobi explained in a video call. “And we cannot deny that, particularly for historical women artists, it’s still a bit of a battle.”Siddal’s works eschewed realism and delighted in beauty and fantasy. Her art often depicted emotionally charged scenes from poetry, like the jewel-toned painting “Lady Clare,” based on an Alfred Tennyson ballad in which the titular character finds out her life has been a lie. In another piece, “The Macbeths,” Siddal paints herself and Rossetti as the ill-fated couple, driven mad by prophecy.Most of the artist’s works are watercolors and drawings. Her only known oil painting — a delicately rendered self-portrait on a circular canvas — is among those lost to time.Reframing the focus on Siddal as a pioneering artist in her own right, rather than on her proximity to male luminaries, is an overdue course-correction. It’s also one many institutions are taking with famous “muses” of art history; photographer Dora Maar, who rose to fame as Picasso’s “Weeping Woman,” and painter Suzanne Valadon, who danced across Renoir’s scenes, are two such artists who have received important retrospectives in the past handful of years.In Siddal’s case, this path to recognition has not been linear. Curator and scholar Jan Marsh has been championing Siddal as a key member of the Pre-Raphaelites since the 1980s, when feminist theory overhauled frameworks around women artists. (Marsh has contributed an essay to the exhibition catalog). Still, myths and misconceptions about Siddal persist, as the ingredients of a tragic heroine’s life fill in the gaps of knowledge around her.“A lot of the stories that are told about Elizabeth are not really stories about Elizabeth — they are stories about Dante Gabriel: his love affair and the inspiration of his art, and the Elizabeth that he creates in his poems and his pictures. And so she gets eclipsed in lots of different ways,” Jacobi said, pointing to the fact that much of what is known about Siddal comes from Rossetti biographies. “I think it’s still really hard to get at that real person.”Television and film interpretations have run with this narrative, from the 2009 BBC miniseries about the Rossettis called “Desperate Romantics,” to the 1967 drama centered on Dante Gabriel, “Dante’s Inferno.” The Ken Russell-directed film, which begins with Siddal’s exhumation, “distills the mainstream idea of Elizabeth, and how powerful the ‘haunted woman’ is as a myth,” Jacobi said.Siddal deserves more than the oversimplified tales about her life. Though she had several months of art schooling and intentionally pursued her creative development, the myth that she was simply discovered by the Pre-Raphaelites while working in a hat shop has stuck, taking away her agency, as Jacobi and Marsh point out. Her physical maladies and opiate addiction have also likely been exaggerated. (Being in fragile health was a gendered cultural signifier in Victorian times, and laudanum, then a sleeping agent and painkiller, was a cure-all for everything.)Even her death, speculated as suicide, is poorly understood. Marsh writes Siddal more than likely died from an opiate overdose while in post-partum psychosis after her daughter was stillborn, but that there has been little concrete evidence she was an addict.And while many art historians have waved away Siddal’s work as largely influenced by her husband, Jacobi says they often worked collaboratively, and that he was taking just as many ideas from her.Her prescience might have been more readily apparent had Siddal lived to see the next era of art unfold — one that she influenced without her knowledge.In one of her drawings, “Lovers Listening to Music,” from 1854, she abandons any narrative in a scene of an affectionate couple — likely based on herself and Rossetti — serenaded by two figures with instruments.“It’s very unusual because there is no story; it is simply a mood, a reverie of love,” Jacobi said.Three years later, Dante Gabriel repeated the musical motif in “The Blue Closet,” which is presented in the Tate’s exhibit adjacent to Siddal’s drawing. His painting in turn greatly influenced the artist William Morris, a key figure in the aesthetic movement, which reveled in beauty and art for art’s sake, rather than realistic scenes of life or moralizing allegories.In hindsight, there’s a “direct genealogy” from Siddal’s approach to aestheticism, a movement which included artists such as James Whistler and Aubrey Beardsley and writers such as Oscar Wilde, Jacobi said. “But of course, she wasn’t part of that story, because she died.”Through “The Rossettis,” Jacobi would like to put forth the real narrative of Siddal: A working-class woman who struck out to be a painter and poet during a highly restrictive era for someone of her gender and social standing. Her work, like that of many women creatives, was not exhibited by mainstream institutions  — the Royal Academy of Arts, at the time — and in fact, she rebelled against their tastes.“She was painting in (her) own way… largely self-taught — that is the story of a modern artist,” Jacobi said. “And I think she was just 30 years before her time.” Top image: Rossetti’s portrait of Siddal as Beata Beatrix. The painting, of Beatrix’s death, is based on Dante Alighieri’s 13th-century poem “La Vita Nuova.”",style,0.0
946,972,https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ramata-toulaye-sy-interview-banel-and-adama-cannes-2023-spc-intl/index.html,Director nominated for Cannes’ top prize with first film,2023-05-08 05:29:00,"When the lineup for the Cannes Film Festival was announced on April 13, it featured plenty of familiar names: Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes; Cannes stalwarts including Hirokazu Kore-eda, Ken Loach and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Towards the end of the list was Ramata-Toulaye Sy – not yet a familiar name, but that could be about to change.A surprise addition to the official selection, French Senegalese director Sy has joined a small club of filmmakers to compete for the Palme d’Or – the festival’s top prize – with their first feature. (The last time this happened was in 2019, when Mati Diop and Ladj Ly – both with connections to Africa – won second and third prizes respectively.)As debuts go, it’s a daunting one. Few places possess a more glaring spotlight than Cannes, and premiering a movie there is a trial by fire that tests the nerves of even the most experienced filmmakers. (There’s a reason reviews are embargoed until after actors and directors have walked the red carpet.) For Sy, who has only previously attended the festival as a student, it’s a leap into the big leagues. But anyone who’s watched her short film “Astel” will have seen she possesses talent in abundance.Her feature film “Banel & Adama” features a young couple (played by Khady Mane and Mamadou Diallo) at odds with their community in northern Senegal, the region where Sy’s parents were born. Cast with non-professional actors who perform in local language Pulaar, the director said the film draws on her dual nationality and the storytelling traditions of both Europe and Africa, combining “everything I know, everything I am and everything that I love.”Ahead of the film’s premiere later this month, she spoke on a video call to discuss her festival debut, streaming versus cinemas and the state of African filmmaking.The following interview was conducted in French via a translator, and has been edited for length and clarity.CNN: Competing for the Palme d’Or with your debut feature is a huge achievement. What can you share about submitting your film to Cannes?Sy: The film has been wrapped for a month and a half. We sent a version to Cannes which was not completely finished – there was still color grading to do, a bit of mixing. As soon as they saw it, they called us and said they wanted the film for Un Certain Regard (a separate competition, where new voices are more common). I was really happy because it’s a great selection for a first-time feature. But the day before the press release, Christian Jeune (Cannes deputy general delegate) called me at midnight and announced that the film will be in competition. It was a big surprise for me and all the team.Where did the idea for “Banel & Adama” come from?I studied at La Fémis – a film school in France – in the screenplay department and it was my end-of-studies screenplay in 2014 to 2015. Then it sat in a drawer for a long time because I wasn’t ready to direct yet and I was more interested in (screen)writing. I think I needed time to find my voice and navigate the film industry. I started (directing) with a short film, “Astel,” in 2020 and then straight into a feature film in 2022.What can you share about the story at this stage?It’s a tragedy. At first, “Banel & Adama” feels like a classic love story; Banel and Adama are a happily married couple living in a remote village in the region of Fouta (northern Senegal). They are fiercely in love. But this love affair is going to bring chaos in the village, because in their community there is no room for passion. Little by little, we realize that this love story focuses more on Banel than Adama – it turns into the story of a woman trying to fulfill herself.Why set your first feature in Senegal?Even though I was born and raised in France, I have a deep bond with Africa, and the (West African) Fulani culture and traditions. For me, it is important to tell stories that take place in Africa because this continent has to be seen and needs to be recognized more than it does today, with more universal and different stories – not just stories about how poor the continent is, the war, the terrorism. For me, doing my first feature in Senegal is like a political gesture.You were born and raised just outside Paris, and live between Paris and Dakar, Senegal today. How has straddling two countries shaped who you are as a person and your voice as a filmmaker?Having both these nationalities has helped me find my way and has helped me to form my worldview. With “Banel & Adama,” I really confront my double identity. It’s a film with several genres: storytelling with griots – African tales – but also Greek and European tragedy, Afro-American magical realism and poetry.Could you talk me through the process of casting non-professional actors?We had the same casting director (as “Astel,” Iman Djionne) who started casting five months before shooting. I really needed people who have the physiognomy of the Fulani and who speak this language. We did several castings in several cities and villages.Banel was the most complicated character to find. We found her very, very late and it was I who found (Khady Mane) by chance when I was walking in the street. The first thing I saw were her eyes. Banel is quite a mythical and mystical character. In (Khady’s) eyes, there was something quite mysterious – a certain madness. Maybe it’s me imagining, because in real life Khady is a very shy person. But those eyes attracted me, so I asked her to audition the next day.With the rise of streaming platforms, there’s perhaps never been greater access to world cinema and African stories. Where do you stand on streaming? Should Netflix come along and say, ‘Here’s a huge check,’ would you consider it?It’s not me who decides, but rather the international sellers. Of course it’s better to see films at the cinema. Nothing can be more beautiful than the experience of watching on a big screen in a dark room surrounded by strangers. But when you don’t have access, it’s more important to see them anyway. Today, a cinema ticket in France is around €15 ($16.50) – it’s super expensive. There are plenty of families who can’t afford that. In Africa, people have more access on streaming platforms than cinemas. The most important thing is that people see the films.Senegal has one of the richest cinematic traditions in Africa. What factors do you think have contributed to that?The Senegalese film scene was very active between the 70s and 90s and then it began to disappear as cinemas started to disappear. Gradually, there were very few screens left. Since the 2010s cinemas have returned. Canal Olympia has opened one movie theater with one screen in Dakar, Cinema Ousmane Sembène followed, and Pathé recently opened a cinema with seven screens. I think the golden age of Senegalese cinema is coming back into force – and this time with more women. I’m very happy to be part of it.Will you be premiering the film in Senegal any time soon?Of course! Pathé Afrique is our African distributor. We’ll have an event in their brand-new venue in Dakar.And will you screen the film in the Fouta region?I hope so. It is going to be more difficult because of the infrastructure that we’d have to bring over there, like projectors and screens. But yes.Returning to Cannes, what are you most looking forward to?The projection in the Grand Theatre Lumière. I’m scared and I’m very excited. Two thousand people in the room, with the press, with the jury. That’s going to be something – it makes you dream.“Banel & Adama” will have its world premiere at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, which runs from May 16-27.",style,0.0
988,1015,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/emirates-etihad-interline-partnership/index.html,Emirates and Etihad are partnering. Will it mean a Mideast super airline?,2023-05-12 07:00:00,"One country, two major airlines operating world-class long-haul fleets out of different major aviation hubs located close to one another.On paper, the United Arab Emirates’ ownership of two powerhouse global longhaul carriers with largely overlapping international air networks that converge so closely might seem an extravagance too far. Isn’t one enough?And so, the announcement by Emirates and Etihad of a new deal to work more closely will inevitably revive rumors of a potential merger between the two: something long discussed at a kind of academic level in aviation circles, particularly during tough economic times, but one potentially stymied by local politics – and the fact that their status symbol hub airports are an hour apart on the ground.Earlier this month, the two airlines, both still coming back from the disruption caused by the pandemic, agreed on a so-called “interline” partnership. The move raises questions about what that means for passengers, and whether a new regional super airline is finally on its way.Emirates and Etihad are both flag carriers of the UAE, the small Gulf country made up of seven emirates. Emirates, established in 1985, is based in Dubai and is one of the world’s largest airlines by most metrics. Etihad is newer, established in 2003 and based in Abu Dhabi.Dubai International Airport and Abu Dhabi International Airport are fewer than 150 kilometers (100 miles) apart and the drive between them takes around 75-90 minutes depending on traffic. By and large, the Emirati capital city Abu Dhabi is known for being smaller and quieter than its glitzy, livelier northeastern neighbor Dubai, but both certainly have their draws for travelers in addition to being regional economic centers.One of the big questions that pops up every time Emirates and Etihad are mentioned in the same announcement is whether it means a closer partnership – reciprocal agreements for frequent flyer benefits, codeshare flights and even a prospective merger.Addison Schonland, partner at consultancy AirInsight Group, plays down the prospect of a merger, characterizing the interline agreement as “primarily a regional tourism marketing effort.”“When these two airlines announced previous memorandums of understanding on aviation security in 2018 and another in 2022 on promoting Abu Dhabi, these agreements did not lead to integration,” he says. “Every time Emirates and Etihad announce joint initiatives, they are asked if this would lead to integration. Every time the answer is a firm ‘no’.”Indeed, says Schonland, “these airlines follow their own strategies on codeshare and interline agreements, like the recent one between Emirates and United Airlines or the one between Etihad and Gulf Air in 2021.”Interline agreements are one of the earliest steps two airlines take when they want to cooperate. Usually, from the passenger standpoint, if you’re connecting from a flight on airline A to airline B, interlining means that you can check your bags in with airline A and not have to collect them at the connecting airport to then check them in again with airline B.This agreement between Emirates and Etihad seems to be a little more expansive than that and looks to also cover what is known as open-jaw ticketing: flying into one city and out of another. That’s the kind of thing that travelers to Europe or Japan do quite often, to avoid having to backtrack on themselves as they explore – and it can be really useful.“In the initial stages of the expanded interline, each carrier will focus on attracting visitors to the UAE by developing inbound interline traffic from select points in Europe and China,” the two airlines said in a joint statement about the partnership.“The ‘open jaw’ arrangement will allow visitors to cover as much ground as possible when exploring Abu Dhabi, Dubai or any other emirate, saving time by removing the need to fly home via their arrival airport.”To give an example, let’s imagine that you’re coming from Europe or China at the beginning of this new program. If you were flying into Dubai International Airport but wanted to visit the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, you’d have to travel down and back to fly home from Dubai. Now, you can fly into Dubai and out of Abu Dhabi, or vice versa.Relatively unusually, you can also do a kind of double open-jaw.“Customers traveling into the UAE also have the option of ‘multi-city flights,’ with the choice to travel from one city on both carriers’ networks, and conveniently returning to another point served by either Emirates or Etihad,” said the airlines’ joint statement.That’s convenient for a number of reasons.First, you might find flight deals or better timings for your schedule out of one airport in your home region but back to another – flying out of Copenhagen and back into Stockholm, say.Second, you may well be able to use this on a longer trip as well: flying from Beijing to Abu Dhabi, spending time exploring the UAE, and then flying out of Dubai to somewhere else, perhaps a city that Etihad itself doesn’t serve but Emirates does.If the new interlining agreements are eligible in the region where you’re flying from, you might find some real bargains, especially if the idea of a stopover for a few days on the trip out and on the way back sounds appealing.Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai are attractive from the stopover point of view: They’ve got loads of hotels at many price points, including some very reasonably priced resort-style hotels with big pools and sunshine on tap.It’s worth keeping an eye out to see whether either Emirates or Etihad – or both – start to offer extended stopover options, or expand existing stopover deals like the Dubai Connect program. Here, if your connection to your onward destination is more than six and less than 26 hours, Emirates will put you up in a hotel for the night as a mini-stopover.From an on-board perspective, both Emirates and Etihad are highly regarded airlines with some of the best passenger experience you can find. By and large, for most passengers you won’t find much of a difference in economy between the two airlines.However, if you do have the option to choose between flights, pick airplanes – of either airline – with wider economy class seats like the Airbus A380 and A350, rather than the narrower seats of the Boeing 777 and 787 that these airlines operate. There’s usually no pricing difference, but the difference between 18.5” and 17” in seat width can feel massive, and the extra room at the shoulder and in the aisles is also a plus.And bear in mind if you’re more of a premium economy traveler, Emirates is the only one of the two airlines to offer it, and only on some routes.",travel,0.0
990,1017,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/merguez-french-sausage-protests/index.html,The spicy hotdog sausage fueling French protests,2023-05-11 09:38:00,"Protesting in France is a hungry business, and when the country’s angry citizens put down their placards, they seek out sustenance.Not for classic French cuisine though. Above all else, demonstrators demand spicy hotdog sausages.Beef and lamb merguez sausages, spiced with cumin, chile or harissa to recipes imported from North Africa, are the food of the streets in France – and not just in the recent protests against pension age reform that have spread through the country.There was merguez in May 1968 when student uprisings whetted appetites for revolution and there was merguez in ’95, when furious crowds tore apart plans for welfare reform.When yellow vest-wearing “gilet jaune” protesters brought parts of France to halt in 2018 to demand political and economic change, the grills were fired up once again and out came the sausages.Such was the meaty role played by merguez in keeping the gilet jaune movement nourished that they were labeled a “revolutionary tool” by François Ruffin, a French politician seen as a contender to lead the far left at the country’s next election.The sausage’s role in helping fuel this year’s sometimes violent protests was observed by academic Emmanuelle Reungoat.A maitresse de conférence – or associate professor – of political sciences at the university of Montpelier, Reungoat spent time meeting with demonstrators and observed that many first-timers joined in because it was an opportunity to hang out with friends and enjoy a barbecue.“They brought with them their usual leisurely habits and that’s interesting because that is also what makes a massive social movement,” Reungoat told CNN. “A social movement can tip into an uprising or a revolution.”France’s annual Labor Day public holiday offers exactly that mix between partying and politics. Held annually on May 1, it’s a celebration of workers’ contributions that is also a chance for people to kick back and enjoy a day off.Most years, France’s trade unions organize parades to mark the occasions. In 2023, for only the third time since the end of World War II, they staged a joint event in Paris, united by their opposition to President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.And of course, there was merguez.Approaching the rally point at Place de la République you could see the smoke. The smell carried down the boulevard in the spring breeze. It was mouthwatering.French novelist Marcel Proust once wrote reverentially of how the scent of freshly baked madeleine cakes could trigger a remembrance of things past. As French newspaper Le Monde put it, the wafts of sausage are “the madeleine de Proust of the workers’ movement.”At one food stall, shrouded in its own aroma, vendor David Joancalves was pushing the meat around in his fryer, waiting for orders – giving customers half a baguette to hold the meat and inviting them to “help yourself to sauces” – a row of condiments in various shades of red and orange.Joancalves has been selling merguez for 15 years and has been at every protest this season. At this year’s May 1 demonstrations he was expecting a peaceful atmosphere. “I think it is going to be more festive, there are families,” he said. In fact, the day culminated in pitched battle between protesters and riot police.Joancalves’ merguez cost 7 euros ($7.70 dollars), perhaps a little on the expensive side for a street food sausage in a cheap piece of bread.There was a better deal across the square where the union trucks were lined up, their colorful liveries like floats on a parade. Here, the Communist Party was selling Champagne from the back of their own truck for 5 euros a glass.It was the French Communist Party which helped bring the merguez to French protests in the 1950s. The sausage first appeared at the Humanité music festival, started in 1930 to fund the Communist Party’s Humanité newspaper, which is still printed today.“The grilled merguez took on, with the fight for Algerian independence, a sign of solidarity with Maghrebian workers,” wrote Nöelle Gérôme, an ethnologist from France’s prestigious National Scientific Research Center (CNRS) in a seminal and perhaps unsurprisingly unique article on the sausage’s place in French protesting, edited by historian Julia Csergo.Easy to cook and even easier to eat, the merguez was soon being served alongside “revolutionary fries” to create cheap meals dished out in France’s never-ending social struggles.On the Place de la République, the Force Ouvrière, another labor union, was selling fries for 2 euros. Its merguez was only 3 euros ($3).“We sell, I am not going to say at a loss, but we make practically no money,” Pierre Maunier, a railway worker, said, adding: “We have a food truck for all our members, for everyone who wants to eat, have a drink, talk, share and it is a moment to share, that’s it.”",travel,0.0

Then gold prices skyrocketed,2023-05-11 01:56:00,"When a colony of reddish-yellow furred Hodgson’s bats, once thought extinct in South Korea, was found in an abandoned gold mine in the country’s Hampyeong county in 1999, some saw a chance.It was exactly what a rural county – located 270 km (170 mi) south of Seoul – with an eroding population needed to boost revenue.The county government decided it would erect a statue of bats – dubbed “golden bats” by savvy marketers – made from, as one could guess, pure gold.Officials spent 2.8 billion won ($2.1 million) in 2005 to erect the seven-foot-tall (2.13-meter) statue, purchasing 162 kg of gold and 281 kg of silver. Then it took three years for renowned South Korean sculptor Byun Kun-ho to sculpt five golden bats flying through a massive silver ring.The sculpture symbolizes “the harmony and immortality of the universe,” Byun wrote in a paper detailing his work.And the expenses didn’t stop there.The statue was installed in a specially-built exhibition hall resembling a cave, the natural habitat for bats. Beside the statue, they laid a golden egg the size of a coffee table, made with leftover gold and silver, to honor Korea’s mythical heroes born from eggs.The local government promised that the statue would bestow the sheen of ecological wonder to the region and bring hordes of tourists to the cash-strapped cattle farming county.But the artwork immediately faced criticism. Its detractors viewed spending millions on a golden statue as a waste, while the county relies on subsidies for around 90% of its revenue. A local newspaper called the move a “flashy but hollow bureaucratic decision” that was “divorced from the local sentiment.”However, local fortunes turned as the price of the precious metal climbed rapidly. Following the economic uncertainty of the pandemic and the Ukraine war, gold prices reached record levels.The estimated value of the statue has increased five-fold to around 14 billion won ($11 million) in recent days, making it one of the most lucrative investments the county has ever made.Though the statue’s remote location has discouraged travelers, around 15,000 mostly Korean tourists have visited in the past few weeks, according to the county.“As the gold price rises, the interest (in the statue) rises too. So more visitors come,” a county representative told CNN.Costing a mere 2000 won ($1.50) to enter, it has become a draw for tourists visiting the county’s renowned butterfly festival.But the value of the golden statue has attracted unwanted attention too. In 2019, three men were apprehended after allegedly attempting to steal it.The thieves reportedly ran away when the alarm sounded. Since then, the county has added extra motion sensors and high-resolution security cameras, on top of the existing bulletproof glass and steel shutters protecting the statue.County officials say they plan to relocate the statue to the more accessible Hampyeong Expo Park from its current location at the Ecological Exhibition Hall.Though the statue’s valuation may be at an all-time high, the county has no plans to sell it.“We didn’t (build the statue) to make a profit,” a representative for the county said.",travel,0.0
1010,1049,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-hiking-cancer/index.html,They met while hiking and fell in love. Then she was diagnosed with cancer,"04:29 PM, Sun May 14, 2023","Patricia Salazar first saw Aaron Toro running along the breathtaking Peekaboo Trail in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah.Patricia was also tackling the trail, alongside two friendly women she’d just met. The July sun was blazing down and the surrounding copper rocks were bathed in a warm light.The Peekaboo Trail is one of the most strenuous in Bryce Canyon. Patricia’s a hardcore runner and extreme sports enthusiast, but even she was finding it tough-going – so the fact that Aaron was running up the mountain like it was nothing was pretty impressive. Patricia couldn’t help but comment on his speed.“Are you trying to be the fastest on the trail?” Patricia shouted at the stranger as he whizzed past.Aaron stopped running, caught his breath, and smiled at Patricia. He brushed off the compliment, said a friendly hello, and offered to take a photo of Patricia and her new friends. The women thanked him, then he was off again, running into the distance. Patricia watched him go.“I’m like, ‘Oh my God, he looks like a Hemsworth brother.’ He was tan and buff, with blond hair. And so I was like, ‘Gosh, what a hunk. That’ll be a good story for later.’”Patricia assumed she’d never see the runner again. But then, mere minutes later, she spotted him on another bend in the trail.“The girls were like, ‘Oh, my God, there he is, there he is.’ And again, I had nothing to lose, nothing to gain – at least so I thought. And so I just hollered at him, ‘Hey, are you single?’”Aaron stopped, turned around, and grinned.“Yeah,” he said. “Single as a one dollar bill.”“At that point, in my mind I was like, ‘Oh, no, what’s my follow-up?’” recalls Patricia.“Do you want my number?” Patricia asked Aaron, spontaneously.“Are you from here?” said Aaron in response.“No,” replied Patricia. “Does it matter?”“No, I guess not,” shrugged Aaron.And so they exchanged names and numbers. Patricia told Aaron she was from California, and in town for a vacation. Aaron said he was based in Virginia at the time.Patricia saved Aaron in her cell phone as “Trail Aaron.”“I said, ‘Okay, I’ll text you,’” recalls Patricia. “Never thinking that I would hear from him or we would connect. And he went on his merry way and kept running.”It was the summer of 2021. Patricia was 31 and enjoying what felt like a gradual return to “normal” following the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I was single, living by myself, and I had been an endurance athlete for a few years,” Patricia tells CNN Travel today.Patricia had never had much luck with dating apps. And meeting people in person in the Covid era felt pretty much impossible. That summer, she was feeling excited about the future and the opportunity to pursue her goals and dreams alone.“I was just going to be the single endurance athlete. I loved cycling, I loved running, and that was just going to fulfill me enough, and that was great,” she says.Patricia had also made a pact with herself: Each year, she’d take a solo trip somewhere to escape from the pressures of work and indulge her hobbies and passions. In summer 2021, with international travel still largely off the table, Patricia picked Utah as her destination. The state was home to some beautiful national parks, perfect for trail running. That July, Patricia drove to Utah from her home in California.“That’s kind of where I was in life, just exploring on my own and being so happy to be in the driver’s seat – not only of my road trip, but of my life,” she says.When he met Patricia, Aaron was in his late twenties. Like Patricia, Aaron was in a place in his life where he was focusing on himself, rather than dating. He was in the middle of a contract with the US Navy and had found being active-duty military didn’t lend itself to meeting prospective partners.“We’re constantly traveling and moving and you’re all over the place all the time,” says Aaron.He spent his down time enjoying endurance sports.“I started training really hard. And I would devote all my time, essentially, to that – and I was okay with that,” he recalls.In July 2021, Aaron was in his home state of Utah to catch up with his parents and sisters and to enjoy some quality time with loved ones before he started his next deployment.“Going out to Utah, a week before I leave the country for six months – the last thing on my mind was meeting someone,” he says.But Aaron was smitten with Patricia from the moment she’d unexpectedly hollered at him on the trail. He was delighted when she asked for his number.“I left thinking, ‘Wow, she’s spectacular. Probably never hear from her ever again in my life.’ Because, you know, stuff like this doesn’t happen. So I’m like, ‘Oh, well, that was nice of her. But she’s probably just goofing with her friends. And I’ll probably never see her again.’”Aaron kept running around Bryce Canyon, and eventually reunited with his family, who’d opted for a more leisurely hike. But as the group were leaving the park, Aaron saw Patricia again – now on her own, having bid farewell to the women she met earlier. Patricia said hi to Aaron and his family as she ran past.“One sec, I’ll catch up with you,” Aaron told his parents, and, without really thinking, he decided to try to speak with Patricia again.When he caught up with her – not easy, says Aaron, she’s super fast – Aaron asked if Patricia would like to walk the last half-mile together.“We started talking,” recalls Aaron, “And it was a really good conversation. We both happened to be training for similar races at the same time. Obviously, she seems really cool. She’s way out of my league, so I was pretty surprised she was talking to me.”Over the course of the conversation, Patricia and Aaron discovered they were both keen to run one of Bryce Canyon’s most famous trails – the beautiful Fairyland Loop – and agreed to meet the following morning to give it a go together.“I felt like he could really be the adventure buddy I never thought I needed, but after meeting him, knew I wanted,” says Patricia.From there, Patricia and Aaron went their separate ways. Patricia cycled back to her Airbnb, where she showered, put her feet up, and was just wondering where she could go for a drink and a bite to eat, when a text from “Trail Aaron” popped up on her phone.Aaron and his family were hanging out at his uncle’s house that evening. He wondering if Patricia fancied joining for brisket?“At that point, I’d eaten bar food and Clif bars for about a week and a half on the roads, I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, home-cooked meal, for sure,” recalls Patricia.“That actually sounds amazing,” Patricia typed in response. “Count me in!”When Aaron sent the invite, he just figured he had “nothing to lose.” He really liked Patricia, and when she said she was up for coming round, he was thrilled.He put down his phone and tracked down his family, who were preparing food in his uncle’s kitchen.“Hey guys, so you know that girl in the green shorts that ran by earlier? Well, she’s coming over,” he said.“Wait, do you even know her?” asked his family, confused.But Patricia fit in right away. It was like she and Aaron had known one another for years, not for mere hours.“I spent the whole night just meeting his family and playing pickleball and cornhole,” says Patricia. “I think his family was a little shocked, but it was an awesome night.”“They’re great people,” says Aaron. “So they were more than welcoming.”“When I got to the house and started talking to his family, I was like, ‘Oh, man, he checks all the dream boxes – comes from an amazing family, is in between two girls, has two sisters, his mom is his best friend, loves to hike, loves to bike…’” says Patricia.Hours later, Patricia and Aaron were sitting out in the backyard together, chatting.“He reached over and he held my hand,” recalls Patricia. “The moment he held my hand, I knew I was going to fall in love with him.”Aaron felt the same way.“There’s just something about her, she was so gorgeous. We had so much fun just hanging out, we connected on so many levels and we were just best friends right off the bat,” he says.“And I don’t know why, but something just clicked in my brain that day and that night where it was like – she’s worth the risk. Seeing how she interacted with my family… Like I said, it was just like, ‘Wow, there’s something special here.’”The next day, Aaron and Patricia ran the Fairyland Loop together. From there, Patricia was planning to head to Utah’s Park City to tackle more trails. She asked Aaron if he wanted to join her.It was only then, when they were in the car en route, that Aaron mentioned he was in the military and was heading off on a six-month deployment in twelve days’ time.When Aaron met potential partners, he never led with the fact he was in active service – he knew it wasn’t always an attractive prospect, given the inevitable long distance.Patricia had never met anyone in the military. She wasn’t sure what to think. But she knew Aaron made her feel safe and excited for the future. She decided this news didn’t change anything.When they stopped for gas, Patricia texted her best friend, “I met the man I’m going to marry on a trail,” she said.“No you didn’t,” replied her friend.“We drove for hours together, we’re staying in an Airbnb together,” said Patricia.For her friend, this message was less exciting and more terrifying, setting off several alarm bells.“Okay, well you need to send me your location,” she wrote back. “We’ve all heard this story before on whatever news network.”After concluding her Utah trip, Patricia was planning to drive back to California, visiting family en route. Knowing that Aaron would be leaving the country within days, she decided to take a leap.“Hey, I don’t want to waste any time,” she said. “Why don’t we just go together, and you can meet my family?”Aaron said sure – she’d already met his family, after all – so Patricia rang her mom to tell her she was bringing along a plus one.“I met this guy on a trail, I really like him,” she said. “I think this is it.”“Wait, who is he?” asked Patricia’s mother, confused.“I think I’m falling in love,” said Patricia. “This is crazy.”En route to Patricia’s parents’ house, Patricia and Aaron stopped over in Salt Lake City. They stayed up into the early hours, talking.“It was the night in Salt Lake that we decided to really go all in,” says Patricia. “We had a lot of serious conversations right off the bat – where we were financially, what our aspirations were, where we were politically, what our relationships with our family were like, and what we really wanted out of life if we were going to have another serious relationship.”Aaron says it was clear the two were aligned, and also ready to meet each other where they were at.“We were both very much on our own path, and we were both taking our lives and our careers very seriously,” he says. “So we just laid that all out on the table for each other. We both said, ‘If I do a relationship again, it’s for real, it’s not just dating around for fun.’”Their talks were sometimes “heavy,” he adds.“I think we were both at that same mental place, and we were both mature enough to just put that all out on the table.”The two came up with a “five-year plan right off the bat,” as Aaron puts it. He knew he didn’t want to stay in the military indefinitely, for example, and both he and Patricia were keen to get married, but liked the idea of an elopement over a big wedding.They’d covered almost everything when Patricia suddenly realized she’d forgotten to check just how long Aaron’s deployment would last.He explained it would be six months, and he’d mostly be stationed in Spain.Patricia had been expecting something way longer, and way further afield. Six months seemed doable.“Let’s do this thing,” she said.The two became official there and then.“We had a pretty good foundation of what to expect out of each other, out of our relationship and out of our lives. So the rest was easy after that,” says Aaron.“With that small hiccup in the middle,” says Patricia. “That whole cancer thing.”For the first few months, Patricia and Aaron found long distance relatively easy. They FaceTimed every day, enjoying more long, deep chats. Within weeks, they told one another they were falling in love. Patricia booked a trip to Spain for September. Their leap of faith back in July seemed to be paying off.“It was really manageable – we felt very lucky how successfully we navigated long distance,” says Patricia.Then fall came, and Patricia had an abnormal pap smear result. She didn’t think too much about it. She went on the planned trip to visit Aaron in Spain. Back in the US, Patricia’s doctor booked her in for a colposcopy. She kept Aaron in the loop.“I wasn’t worried about it,” says Patricia. “I think in the back of his mind, he was a little more worried than I was.”Then the results came through: Patricia had stage two cervical cancer.She wanted to tell Aaron the news on FaceTime rather than via text. By then, he was based somewhere in Africa.“I remember just waiting up late that night for him to wake up to tell him,” says Patricia.She was in a state of shock. How could she tell this man she was falling for more and more each day, who was currently hundreds of miles away across oceans, that she had a crushing diagnosis and uncertain future?“I sat in the living room, and FaceTimed him, and I said, ‘This is my diagnosis,” recalls Patricia.In one of their deep conversations in Salt Lake City, both Patricia and Aaron had expressed a desire to have kids. Now, Patricia’s doctor had said it was unlikely she’d be able to have biological children. And the journey to recovery was set to be long, complicated and uncertain.“If this isn’t the path that you want to walk on with me, I completely understand,” Patricia told Aaron that night. “I love you, you love me. And so it’s been fun, but I’m not going to make that choice for you.”Aaron jumped in right away.“No, I want you forever more than I want anything else,” he said.“I wanted to reach through the phone, ‘What are you talking about?’” recalls Aaron today. “We’re in this for the long-haul, no matter what, cancer’s not going to get in the way of that, it’s just one more thing.”So Aaron said all the right things, and did his best to comfort Patricia from afar. But he was horribly aware of the distance. And the creeping fear.“There’s nothing I could do other than just try to comfort her through a phone,” he says today.Over the next few months, Patricia had another biopsy, to determine the cancer hadn’t spread, and started fertility treatment, as she still hoped to have biological children one day. Aaron supported her throughout and was always there, even if he couldn’t be physically there.“He was there every day for me and, I kid you not, there were nights that I cried myself to sleep with him on the phone, on FaceTime,” says Patricia.“I hated to Google what the doctors were sending me and so he would Google for me and be like, ‘Don’t Google that.’”Things “got worse before it got better,” as Aaron puts it.At first, it seemed like a dose of radiation could target Patricia’s cancer. Then doctors started discussing surgery and concluded Patricia needed a hysterectomy. This would be an invasive procedure with significant recovery time.Aaron was granted emergency leave to go home to the US to support Patricia in person in the weeks before, during and after the surgery. He’s eternally grateful for this.In late 2021, Covid-related rules still restricted Californian hospital visitors. But whenever he was permitted to be in the building, Aaron was by Patricia’s side.“That was a huge, I guess, strength-builder in our relationship,” says Patricia of this period. “I didn’t know if we could get stronger than we already were. And then that happened.”While Patricia was in hospital, Aaron met Patricia’s grandparents, who she’s very close with, for the first time. Patricia’s grandmother immediately took Aaron aside.“Her grandma takes me into the other room. And she gives me Trisha’s great-grandma’s engagement ring, which is a family heirloom ring,” recalls Aaron. “She’s like, ‘This is for when you ask Trish to marry her.’”Aaron remembers sitting in his car in the hospital parking lot, turning the beautiful ring over in his hands.“I had the family ring, and I was literally just sitting there for hours outside the hospital in the rain,” he says, getting emotional at the memory. “I knew as soon as she came out of hospital that I was going to ask her to marry me.”On Christmas Eve 2021, Aaron proposed to Patricia.“I was laying on the couch. We were in matching Christmas onesies,” recalls Patricia. “And on Christmas Eve, my family usually lets us open one Christmas present. So I said, ‘Let’s keep that tradition going, let’s open one Christmas present.’”She gave Aaron a pair of slippers. Then he got down on one knee and asked her to marry him, presenting her with the family ring.“I could barely move, nine days after my surgery. But I jumped up off of that couch so fast to say yes,” recalls Patricia. “It was very exciting, and our families were so thrilled for us.”Over the first half of 2022, Patricia continued to recover from surgery and went through five weeks of radiation.“I knew there was a finish line and Aaron would be waiting at it, so I took it day by day,” she says.Then, in September 2022, Patricia and Aaron got married. As they’d always planned, they eloped. The ceremony took place amid the red rocks in Snow Canyon, Utah, not far from where their relationship first began.“It was exactly what we wanted,” says Patricia, who took Aaron’s name, becoming Patricia Toro. “We left out of our vows, ‘through sickness and health,’ because we’ve already gone through that, we know we can accomplish that.”Fast forward to today, and Aaron’s finishing up his final navy deployment and Patricia’s in remission. The couple are looking forward to the future.“The sky’s the limit. We’re not 100% sure where we’re going to end up but we have a few plans in place, and it’s all looking up from here,” says Aaron.It’s not even two years ago that Patricia and Aaron first met, but the two feel like they’ve crammed a lifetime of ups and downs into their relationship so far.It’s surreal to think about, especially when they consider the slim chances of them meeting in the first place.“It doesn’t feel real, it feels like we’re living in a simulation, because it’s just ridiculous,” says Aaron. “We live on opposite coasts, we both happen to be in Utah, in the same National Park, same day.”“I am not a super-religious person, and neither is Aaron. But we both feel that there was something that put us on that trail that day,” says Patricia. “And I don’t know if that something knew the struggles that I was going to go through three months later. Or if they knew that he’s going to need me in his life at one point. But we were there for a reason that day. And I know that my journey these last 17 months would have been a lot different had Aaron not been there.”",travel,0.0

1017,1056,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html,What to do when a shark goes after you,"04:29 PM, Sun May 14, 2023","First things first: Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon.But sharks do occasionally attack humans.Florida teen Addison Bethea was severely injured in the summer of 2022 when a shark attacked her in the waters off Keaton Beach along Florida’s Gulf Coast. A beach closure was put in place after a woman suffered a shark bite off Southern California’s famed Del Mar Beach in November 2022. And in Hawaii, a 60-year-old man was attacked by a shark but was able to swim to a catamaran for help in March 2023.While these kinds of encounter understandably strike fear into would-be ocean swimmers, there’s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low.The Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File found only 73 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 39 confirmed, provoked bites in 2021 worldwide.Think about it a minute – the world population is nearing 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And only 112 bites were logged. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher.In 2021, the United States led the way in unprovoked attacks at 47; Florida had the highest state total at 28.That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel.Know your environmentSharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors.“If you’re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,” said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.“Fortunately, humans aren’t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.”Still, there are places you’re more likely to encounter a shark.River mouths are not the best place to swimYou should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks.“An awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river – people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,” said Peirce.Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out.Avoid areas with fishingBefore you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says “forget it.”“Whether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,” he said.Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That’s a possible sign a shark might be nearby.He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore.Avoid dusk and dawnSwimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it’s also the time when a shark attack is most likely.“A lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,” Peirce says, “due to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.”Hang with lifeguardsChris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to “do your homework” before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places.If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.“I always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It’s a lot safer,” he said.Don’t wear shiny objects in the water“Be careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.” Lowe said.In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. “And you don’t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.”Follow your instincts“Probably the most important thing is to follow your gut,” Hammerschlag said. “If you feel wary about getting in the water … just don’t go in the water.”“A lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn’t listen to it,” he said.Don’t panicSo you’re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic.“Don’t start splashing around – you’re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark’s interest,” said Peirce.Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose.“A shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it’s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,” said Peirce.“That’s why we often get exploratory bites which don’t result in death and sometimes don’t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you’re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.”Maintain eye contactAs the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact.“Sharks are ambush predators,” Peirce explained. “If you’re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it’s not going to be half as comfortable as if it’s able to sneak up from behind.”Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you’re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore.If you’re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. “Let the shark know it’s being watched.”Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand.“You’re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,” Fragola says in the video.Stay big or get smallThis is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.“The bigger you are in the water, the more respect you’ll get,” he said.But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce’s advice is to roll up into a ball.“If a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,” he explained.“If I didn’t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor – and if it wasn’t showing massive interest in me – I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.”Don’t play deadThis isn’t a bear, it’s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots – but be careful where you aim.“There’s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That’s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,” said Peirce.“This is a moving object in the water and you’re not staying still either, so what you don’t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.”A good shot to the gills can also do the job: “The gills are very sensitive – giving a shark a whack in the gills isn’t a bad idea.”Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.“If you’re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you’re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,” Peirce says.“I’ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it’s (been) enough to use a shark billy – a small metal rod between two and three feet long – and I’ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.”It’s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you’ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten.Cut off the anglesIf you’re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can’t get behind you, says Peirce.“Keep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you’ve only got one direction to look. You’re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.”Slowly back awayDisplace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore.“You must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you’ve got to be careful – large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.”Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim.“If a white shark is in full attack mode, there’s not much you’re going to be able to do at that point,” he says.",travel,0.0
1018,1057,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/football/erling-haaland-profile-manchester-city-spt-intl/index.html,"After a record-breaking season, Erling Haaland is on track to become ‘the best striker ever’",2023-05-12 16:17:00,"Erling Haaland’s arrival at Manchester City last summer was met with equal measures of excitement and curiosity.At the age of 22, the Norwegian forward had already established himself as one of the best goalscorers in European football – first at Red Bull Salzburg, then with two prolific seasons at Borussia Dortmund.But now he was moving to a team already replete with attacking talent and a league in which big-name signings have come and gone without leaving an impression.Would he adapt to life in the Premier League? The answer has been yes, emphatically – even to the extent that Haaland has surpassed the expectations of some of his greatest admirers during his first 10 months at Man City.“I didn’t expect him to break the records in the first season, to be honest, but I knew that he would fit in – that the team, the coach, the environment would take him to a higher level,” Otto Addo, the former Ghana manager who mentors young players at Dortmund, tells CNN Sport.The numbers behind Haaland’s first season defy belief. He’s scored 51 club goals in 47 games this season: 35 in the Premier League, 12 in the Champions League, three in the FA Cup and one in the League Cup.Only Dixie Dean, who scored 63 in the 1927/28 season, has more goals in English football during a single top-flight campaign.Haaland’s Premier League tally, which includes four hat-tricks, is a league record for a single season, breaking the previous mark held jointly by Alan Shearer and Andy Cole.Shearer and Cole recorded their 34-goal seasons at a time when Premier League teams played 42 games, rather than the current 38; Haaland currently has four games remaining to add to his haul, including when City faces Everton on Sunday.Forming a potent partnership with midfielder Kevin De Bruyne – perhaps the best passer of the ball in European football – Haaland has made an immediate impact at City.But De Bruyne’s laser-like passing hasn’t been the sole reason for his success, nor the excellence of teammates Jack Grealish, Rodri, or Bernardo Silva, to name a few. Haaland, Addo observes, has modified his game to devastating effect since arriving in the Premier League, taking his pace, power, and deadly finishing to another level.“I think he’s learned to be patient, to wait for the situation in the box and to take the right runs inside the box,” Addo says.“Even though there were games where you didn’t see him too much on the ball, you could see that he was always ready. Even if it’s in the last minute, he’s always ready to score, always ready to make the right run in the right situation.”Addo, a former Dortmund player and Ghanaian international, oversees the development of the Bundesliga club’s talented crop of young players. He believes Haaland became a more complete player in Germany, scoring a greater number of right-footed and headed goals, as well as improving his movement off the ball in defense and attack.The pair have written to each other from time to time over the past year and Haaland gave gifts to some of his former coaches after Dortmund and City played each other in the Champions League earlier this season.“As a human being, I’m happy for him,” says Addo. “He has the mindset, he has the ability to score, to run, to have the right positions, to be hungry. If he keeps this hunger, which I guess he will, then surely, he will be the best striker ever.”Addo recalls times when Haaland would score two or three goals in a game for Dortmund, only to be angry with the coaches when he was substituted off.“This is the mentality you wish on every player – that he’s never satisfied, that he doesn’t relax, he doesn’t feel comfortable even though he scores a lot of goals,” says Addo. “He always wants more.”Haaland’s finishing has been at its deadliest this season when he’s inside the penalty area, according to data provided by The Analyst, part of Stats Perform, which shows 11 of his 35 league goals coming from inside the six-yard box.Scoring goals has always been at the heart of Haaland’s game, ever since he was a young boy playing in Bryne – a town of around 12,000 people on the southwestern tip of Norway.At the age of 16, he moved from Bryne to Molde FK to play in the top flight of Norwegian football under the guidance of former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer; from there, he made his name with Salzburg, Dortmund, and now Man City.“Erling had an incredible journey in the sense that he has taken to the next level perfectly,” Alf Ingve Berntsen, who coached Haaland for eight and a half years as a youth player at Bryne, tells CNN Sport. “In a way, it’s natural for him just to keep doing what he has always done.”Berntsen makes sure to watch all of Haaland’s games, so long as they don’t clash with the schedule of his beloved Liverpool team. He finds a certain novelty in watching the powerful forward – now six-foot-four and reportedly carrying 12 kilograms of muscle compared to 15 months ago – exhibit the same qualities as when he was a young kind.“In practice, just like now, he scored a lot of goals. He smiled a lot and trained a lot, so in a funny way, it’s quite like now,” says Berntsen.“If you see the matches now, many of his movements are familiar … he has quite the same playing style as before. The main thing with Erling was he scored a lot of goals and was funny and loveable guy.”With his move to Man City, Haaland followed in the footsteps of his father, Alf Inge – a former defender and midfielder who also had stints at Nottingham Forest and Leeds. His mother, Gry Marita Braut, was a Norwegian heptathlon champion.A figure of influence over his son’s professional career, Alf Inge even caused a stir in the stands during this week’s Champions League semifinal when he was moved to a different seat after taunting Real Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.But when Haaland was a youth player at Bryne, it was rare to see his father on the sidelines at training sessions.“He left Erling on his own because he could see that Erling had fun, developed, got better and better and better in a good, safe environment with friends,” says Berntsen.“As it became clear that Erling is something special and he had to move from Bryne to Molde … Then his father became very important, of course, and he had to prepare Erling for how to meet a new job, how to be accepted in the world, how to be a professional.”Haaland’s professionalism is a quality regularly singled out by teammates and coaches as a reason for his success.Manchester City midfielder İlkay Gündoğan said he is the first to arrive at the training ground, while Grealish has called Haaland “the best professional I have ever seen” when it comes to diet, treatment, and recovery.At Dortmund, Addo says that Haaland had his own personal trainer to help with physical conditioning, explaining how “even if he’s off the pitch, he does a lot on his body.”His dedicated approach has already reaped rewards as he was named the Football Writers’ Association’s Footballer of the Year on Friday with 82% of the votes – the biggest winning margin in the Premier League era.More goals, records, and accolades are likely to be a mainstay of Haaland’s career if he is able to stay healthy.“He’s still young and he will improve even more,” says Addo. “He will be the best player on this planet one day. He’s very close now – maybe the best player already.”",sport,0.0

1022,1061,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/13/football/christian-eriksen-cardiac-arrest-comeback-spt-intl/index.html,What Christian Eriksen learned about life and living after suffering a cardiac arrest playing for Denmark,2023-05-13 05:47:00,"On June 12, 2021, Denmark’s Christian Eriksen collapsed in the corner of the pitch during a European Championship match against Finland. As his teammates surrounded him, arm-in-arm, shielding him from the eyes of the world, doctors began working to save the midfielder’s life.“Well, what should I say? He was gone. And we did cardiac resuscitation and it was cardiac arrest. How close were we? I don’t know,” said Morten Boesen, Denmark’s team doctor, the following day.As Eriksen approaches the two-year anniversary of that life-changing moment, the 31-year midfielder is back on the pitch, has signed for one of the biggest soccer clubs in the world, and represented his country at the 2022 World Cup.But this brush with death has made Eriksen remarkably philosophical and reflective – perhaps understandably – about life and living.“I’ve learned that even after a bad time, there’s always a time after where everything will be different,” Eriksen told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies and Laureus co-host after receiving the Comeback of the Year award at the Laureus Sports Awards in Paris.“One of the first quotes I heard was that even if you feel good, you’re going to feel bad, you’re going to feel good again. It’s just going to go up and down – time is your best friend.”When the midfielder collapsed in the first half of Denmark’s Euro 2020 match against Finland, nobody knew if he would ever play professional football again.“What I’ve seen today, everyone has their own story, all kinds of different setbacks in every sport,” added Eriksen.“The one I had was obviously a severe one, but nonetheless it made me still want to come back and play football, and then obviously to getting the award now.”After receiving life-saving treatment on the pitch, Eriksen was subsequently fitted with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) device – a type of pacemaker intended to prevent fatal cardiac arrests by discharging a jolt to restore regular heart rhythm.Serie A club Inter Milan, whom Eriksen had been contracted to at the time of the incident, told him that he would be allowed to move abroad in order to continue his football career, with the midfielder unable to play in Italy unless the ICD device was removed.He started training with former club Odense Boldklub in Denmark, with Eriksen asserting that his heart was “not an obstacle” to his ambitions of a return to football and to play in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.Eriksen joined Premier League club Brentford on a free transfer in January 2022. Following six months of “hard work” and 259 days after his cardiac arrest, Eriksen played in a Premier League match for the London club against Newcastle United.In July 2022, Eriksen then signed a three-year deal with Manchester United, which was another free transfer.But following the heart attack, Eriksen was unsure if he even wanted to continue his professional football career.“Yeah, at the time I said it [wanting to quit football], obviously when they say you have a heart attack, and a lot of stuff will happen, you have an ICD and so on,” Eriksen explained. “But at the time also I knew that if I could play football I wanted to come back, but I wanted to do it in a safe, possible way.”Eriksen says he’s “still the same person,” adding that, “I think the teammates will say the same. I’m probably even more relaxed than I was before.“I’ve probably found out that football is life, but it’s not that important. There’s not a lot of other stuff that’s more important in life but football, of course, is an important one. But I’m just taking it step-by-step, really.”Eriksen’s form in Manchester was good enough to earn him a spot in the Denmark squad at the 2022 World Cup – his main goal when returning to football.“It was very, very special,” Eriksen remembered of his time in Qatar. “The aim of my comeback was I want to be able to get myself involved at the World Cup. [But] obviously, I didn’t think at the time that I was going to be starting and playing as I was at the World Cup.”According to Denmark’s star man, the team in Qatar was more united than ever before following the incident.“I think our bonding with the national team was very strong before, but definitely that helped them move even closer together,” the midfielder explained.“Since I’ve come back into the team, I feel the atmosphere, which was good before, is even more bonding because they have experienced something together, that’s really a tough time, but they work it through and they came through in a positive way.”The Denmark squad had a disappointing World Cup campaign in Qatar, but the story of Eriksen’s comeback will live on for a lot longer than their group stage exit.",sport,0.0
1023,1062,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/12/football/psg-jose-mourinho-roma-europa-league-spt-intl/index.html,Jose Mourinho: ‘The Special One’ is back in the headlines after a memorable week,2023-05-12 07:49:00,"José Mourinho, who in 2004 famously referred to himself as the ‘The Special One’ as he was introduced to the media as the new Chelsea manager, is having quite a week.Under the 60-year-old’s watchful gaze, Italian club Roma is well placed to reach this season’s Europa League final having beaten Bayern Leverkusen 1-0 in the first leg of the semifinal on Thursday.Even before Roma’s victory, Mourinho was also being linked with a move to one of the richest clubs in world football – Paris Saint-Germain.Under Christophe Galtier, PSG looks set to win yet another Ligue 1 title but was dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, despite boasting some of the biggest stars in the sport – notably Neymar Jr., Kylian Mbappé and arguably the greatest player in history, Lionel Messi.It’s also a club in somewhat of a crisis having recently suspended Messi for two weeks after he left France to attend promotional events in Saudi Arabia.The club has had to condemn fans for targeting both Messi and teammate Neymar in recent weeks.Mourinho has shown he has the personality and ability to manage top players in fractured dressing rooms, but he has been quick to brush off the speculation.“If they called, they didn’t find me,” he quipped in a Sky Sport Italia interview on Wednesday, when asked about the PSG reports.Prior to joining Roma, Mourinho managed Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, but was unceremoniously sacked just before the Carabao Cup final in 2021.Since then he’s got back to winning ways, guiding Roma to its first trophy in 14 years after victory in the Europa Conference League last season.Mourinho’s current contract at the club runs until 2024 but, with the team seventh in Serie A, its qualification into next season’s Champions League appears to depend entirely on winning the Europa League.If his side slips up, football journalist James Horncastle suggests Mourinho may be tempted to try win the Champions League again with PSG – a tournament he’s already won with Porto and Inter Milan.“He sees Roma as a way to bounce back to another big job,” Horncastle said on the Football Daily podcast.“José is someone who ultimately wants to win wherever he goes and I think he feels that at Roma, unless they start changing the strategy and start spending more money, they’re not going to be able to deliver a league title.“He would like a project that is befitting his legacy again, which would be the chance to compete for a Champions League.”While rumors swirl around his future, Mourinho was happy that his Roma side found a way to win the first leg of its Europa League semifinal.His side came up against German outfit Leverkusen which is managed by one of Mourinho’s former players – Xabi Alonso.Friendships were put aside for Thursday’s encounter at Roma’s famous Stadio Olimpico though, as Edoardo Bove’s second-half effort put the Italian side in the driver’s seat ahead of the second leg on May 18.“It’s down to the lads,” Mourinho told reporters after the win on Thursday.“They have this mentality, this desire and this empathy – something I often say. They have a sense of responsibility that makes them want to give absolutely everything to make the fans happy.”",sport,0.0

The two-time MVP scored or assisted on 26 points in the opening 12 minutes – the Suns had just 26 points as a team.The Nuggets took a 44-26 lead after the first and never looked back.Jokić controlled the game with his triple-double and with Jamal Murray and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope contributing over 20 points each, the Nuggets eased their way to victory.The result, and particularly the performance, will be a concern to Suns fans as many will feel it is a repeat of Phoenix’s horrific Game 7 display last year.In 2022, it was the Dallas Mavericks who blew out the Suns with a 123-90 win in a crucial playoff tie, and once again the Suns have not been able to produce in a win-or-go-home game.Devin Booker struggled with his shot and could only muster up 12 points in his 36 minutes on the court. Kevin Durant was also far from his best in a disappointing night for the Suns franchise.“It was a bad feeling,” Durant told reporters after the game. “It was embarrassing. They came out and got us in the mouth and we couldn’t recover.”Cameron Payne, who surprisingly led the Suns in scoring, also told reporters: “I wish it would have been at least closer. Of course, I want to win, but this just doesn’t look good.”Denver head coach Michael Malone was full of praise for this team after the series win.“When we defend, when we rebound, when we run, when we share the ball, we all believe we’re the best team in the NBA,” he told reporters after the game.Elsewhere in the playoffs, the Boston Celtics clinched a Game 6 win against the Philadelphia 76ers, despite not having home court advantage.The Celtics ground out a 95-86 win to ensure the series goes back to Boston for Game 7 in a brilliant team performance on the road.The series decider should be an incredible matchup with both teams looking to right some wrongs from previous years, and it seems the Sixers are up for the challenge.“If I have to go to war on the road, Game 7 in Boston, I would want to go with this group,” Sixers’ Tyrese Maxey told reporters. “I know we’ve got some fighters, I know we’ve got some resilient guys. I’m ready to get it on.”Game 7 will take place Sunday with the time unconfirmed awaiting the result of Game 6 from the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors series.",sport,0.0
1036,1075,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/football/napoli-serie-a-title-win-2022-23-italy-spt-intl/index.html,From Diego Maradona and financial bankruptcy to title winners: Napoli’s ‘special’ Serie A victory,2023-05-05 06:17:00,"On April 29, 1990, ‘Nothing Compares 2 U’ by Sinead O’Connor topped the charts in the US, the Detroit Pistons had just begun their road to a second successive NBA title and cranes began pulling down the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate.In Naples, Marco Baroni was leaping into the Italian spring air to head a ball past a diving goalkeeper to put Napoli one goal ahead against Lazio.One seemingly small event sent a fandom and a city crazy with joy.The defender’s powerful header was the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory and those three points assured Napoli’s position atop Serie A, two points ahead of AC Milan who also won that day.In doing so, Baroni clinched the club’s second ever Italian league title, cementing its golden era into Napoli folklore – an era spearheaded by the great Diego Maradona.The joy of those two Scudetto title successes didn’t last that long though: Napoli suffered relegations, financial difficulties, near misses and the coming and going of superstars – all without reclaiming that elusive third title.That was until this year. Led by the towering Nigerian Victor Osimhen, the enigmatic Georgian Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and coach Luciano Spalletti, Napoli has romped to the Serie A title, ending 33 years in the wilderness. A fandom and a city, again, rejoice.“The city is special. For example, it’s very difficult for others to understand what we do for our club,” Daniele ‘Decibel’ Bellini, Napoli’s stadium announcer, told CNN Sport.In recent years, Bellini has gone viral for his videos announcing Napoli’s goalscorers during games. His ‘call and response’ style with the fans leaves viewers with goosebumps, such is the enthusiasm displayed from both parties.One YouTube video of Bellini calling out the name of former Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuaín has been viewed over six million times. In the video, Bellini calls out the Argentine’s first name nine times, with the Napoli faithful roaring back the player’s surname in response.“Every time, I tell them the club is like a girlfriend, is like a mother, is something special for us. And this is the reason for all this passionate, all this incredible love for the team and maybe this is the reason when I go to the stadium and I do my job, the people wait for me for pictures and signatures and videos.”But, after years of heartache, the title victory is important for so much more than just on field success; it is a victory for southern Italy against its northern rivals, not least because there has long been economic tension between those two parts of the country.“It will be not just the first time Napoli has won the title since Maradona, but the first time the true south has won, if you’re not counting Rome” Kirsten Schlewitz – Napoli fan and author of the upcoming book ‘More Than Maradona: The Birth, Death and Rebirth of SSC Napoli’ – told CNN.“It is a big deal for the city as a whole to have that pride and to be able to say: ‘Look, we can do it too. You don’t need to be the rich northerners. We assembled a smart squad.’“It’s not a club where teams can just come in and pick off their players and there’s an incredible pride in Napoli developing, Napoli finding the good players, not so much for the youth squad, but being able to be that smart team that can build a competitive squad without …  spending big money on players who are over the hill.“So there’s that pride in being able to say: ‘Yeah, but yeah the south did this and the south did this in a different way.’”Football is in Naples’ DNA.Whether it is the fanatical supporters crammed into the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium on matchdays or the hordes of fans who race through the streets after a Napoli victory, not much gets done on the day of a home game.Bellini says the vice-like grip that the club has on the city is down to Naples only playing host to one major team, Napoli – a phenomenon unlike most other Serie A cities.“Milan has two, Turin have two, Rome have two and Genoa also have two,” he explains. “Naples is the only big, big, big city in Italy where we have just one club. And this is very important for us and all the people here support Naples.”As a result, every home game is like a festival of football, with fans reveling in the displays of brilliance their favorite Napoli players – dressed in the sky-blue shirts and white shorts – produce.Over the years, they’ve had their fair share of awe-inspiring players who have dazzled and astonished – most notably, the diminutive genius, Maradona.The Argentine arrived in the south of Italy in 1984, joining from Barcelona for a then world-record fee of $10.5 million.With Maradona’s arrival came a level of success Napoli had previously never seen, culminating in a 1987 title victory; the club’s first ever Scudetto.Bellini remembers how he celebrated the victory as a six-year-old whose fandom for Napoli was burgeoning.“I stayed on the balcony in my house with my flag, and you can find the picture on Instagram. With my flag on the balcony without possibility to do something or do fiesta or with the supporters, because I was very, very little. But very happy. Very proud. When I was born, I was born with Maradona and that Napoli and, always in my life, I support Naples.”Three years later, Napoli reclaimed the title, once again with Maradona at the forefront.For a city and football club that had often been looked down upon by its northern rivals, that run of success was an opportunity for the region to proudly express its time on top.When Napoli won its first Serie A title in 1987, the Gentleman Ultra website notes: “In the city, mock funerals were held for Juventus. Naples finally had a riposte to their overweening Northern foes: ‘May 1987, the other Italy has been defeated, a new empire is born.’”But that four-year stretch proved to be an abnormality rather than a trend.A year after the 1990 title success, the Napoli team began to unwind with players departing, leading to a drop in performances.The headline departure came when Maradona failed a drug test and he left Italy in disgrace after being handed a 15-month ban.Following years of steady decline, the club was relegated from Serie A after claiming a miserly 14 points from 34 games. Only eight years after being crowned Italian champion, Napoli found itself in the second tier.The disappointment didn’t end there though for Napoli. Despite a small respite back in the top-flight in the 2000/01 season, the club was immediately relegated after their first season back in Serie A before the club was declared bankrupt for the second year in a row, which saw it relegated to the third tier of Italian football.Although the club had fallen to its lowest league position in its history dating back to the 1920s, Bellini says the fanatical support around the club never suffered.“You can find on the Internet or in a YouTube the video when we are in Serie C with 60,000 people at the stadium and the opposing team are a very tiny team and they are not able to play in San Paolo stadium [what is now the Diego Maradona stadium] in front of 60,000 people. And this is the big passion, big passion of Neapolitan people and big love for this club.”But like a phoenix, Naples rose from the ashes; spearheaded by the most unlikely of saviors.When the club was at its most vulnerable financially, in swooped Italian film giant Aurelio De Laurentiis to rescue the club with the aim of establishing stability and a return to former glories.And De Laurentiis made good on his promises, bringing Napoli back into the Italian top-flight in three years and into European competitions in the second year back in Serie A.De Laurentiis’ no-nonsense approach to running the club has brought success but has also brought tension. Fans and De Laurentiis have been at loggerheads about new proposed ticket prices although a picture posted on the owner’s Twitter account suggests that that tension has been resolved for now.Schlewitz says that despite any friction against the owner, “a whole lot is going to be forgiven” with the title victory.Behind savvy transfer dealings and shrewd coaching appointments, the club established itself as one of Italy’s elite.In the 16 years since the club’s return to Serie A, Napoli fans have seen some of Europe’s best players grace the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium pitch – from Edinson Cavani and Higuaín to Dries Mertens and Marek Hamšík – as well as rotating cast of elite managers – Walter Mazzarri, Rafael Benítez, Maurizio Sarri and Carlo Ancelotti have all had stints in the Naples dugout.However, beyond cup success, Napoli was never able to reclaim that elusive Scudetto behind the dominance of Italy’s northern clubs.“It’s very, very hard to win in Italy because the north of Italy has a high representative of teams as Juventus, as Milan, as Inter and, in the south, it’s very difficult to (win),” Bellini said.“For example, Roma or Lazio in the center of Italy have only two or three times won the title because it is very, very difficult to win against the north; against the money, power of those clubs. And when we had Maradona in our club, we did this. We win against the against Juventus, against Milan, against Inter.”The 2022/23 season has been different though.Behind a previously unheralded squad – Kvaratskhelia was signed from Georgia for little fanfare, the midfielder trio of Stanislav Lobotka, André-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Piotr Zieliński have all flattered to deceive before and Kim Min-jae arrived from Turkey in the summer to transform the defense into one of the league’s most formidable – Napoli has blown away the domestic competition.The team’s unheralded star though, according to Schlewitz, is left back Mário Rui. Rui signed for the club in 2017 under Sarri but has undergone a transformation this season.“I have to say that I intensely disliked Mario Rui. And he just used to make all kinds of mistakes,” Schlewitz said. “He came in 2017 and he would either go into tackles too hard or he would turn the ball over too quickly or just be in the wrong place at the wrong time.“And now he is 31, and it’s like he’s finally grown into the player that he was always supposed to be. And I’m just glad that the squad had faith to keep him around because he’s kind of the anchor point. And he’s not our captain in name, but he’s kind of our captain in spirit.”Even the team’s manager, Spalletti, came to Naples with a reputation of producing beautiful footballing teams but ones that falter at the crucial moments.Whereas in previous seasons where fans would avoid talking about title challenges out of a fear of jinxing the team, Bellini says the huge lead the team established after last year’s World Cup break allowed fans to dream before Thursday’s draw sealed the title victory.Over 30 years after Maradona led Napoli to its last Serie A title, Osimhen, Kvaratskhelia and company have done the same to end the heartache of some of Italy’s most passionate fans.And for someone who has been working inside the Napoli stadium and around the team for approximately 14 years – and as a fervent fan himself – Bellini said this moment had been a long time coming and that he has an idea of how he’ll announce the team’s title success to the stadium when they play at home for the first time as champions.“I have something in my mind, but I don’t know very well what my heart suggests to me because I don’t want to prepare something special or special words for that moment because I think my heart can suggest the best word in that moment,” he said.Bellini added: “I’ve dreamed of this moment since when I was young, and especially since when I start to do this job with Naples, I dreamed this whole night.“This is special.”",sport,0.0
1040,1079,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/20/golf/matt-fitzpatrick-brother-zurich-classic-spt-intl/index.html,‘We know what’s at stake’: Matt Fitzpatrick playing to win his brother a PGA Tour spot at Zurich Classic,"04:30 PM, Sun May 14, 2023","In 2013, a 14-year-old Alex Fitzpatrick caddied his older brother Matt to victory at the US Amateur Championship in Brookline, a win that secured the champion an exemption for the following year’s US Open.The rest is history: Matt Fizpatrick would return to the same site in 2022 to clinch the major, announcing his arrival as England’s premier golfing talent.Now, the world No. 8 has the chance to return a favor to his younger sibling.On Thursday, the Fitzpatrick brothers will pair for the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, a PGA Tour event that will see 80 two-player teams battle it out at TPC Louisiana for a split of the $2,398,000 winner’s purse.The triumphant pair on Sunday will also receive a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour. Though not a motivation for the field’s elite names like Fitzpatrick, for his 24-year-old younger brother – ranked 705th in the world and forging his path on the Challenge Tour – it could be life-changing.“That would be incredible for him, there’s no doubt about that,” Fitzpatrick told CNN Sport’s Don Riddell.“We know what’s at stake and we know what possibilities there are if he does well and, hopefully, we can do that.”A few months after Fitzpatrick’s dramatic US Open triumph, he found himself pitted in the same field as his younger sibling at the Italian Open in Rome.After the second round, the junior Fitzpatrick led the major champion in average driving distance by 0.36 yards – a slender gap, yes, but enough to warrant a jab via text. The reply – shared via Fitzpatrick’s Instagram – showed a screenshot of the US Open winner’s name atop the leaderboard, with his brother’s tied-18th position included for good measure.Yet beneath the cheap shots, it’s all brotherly love, and the pair gel well on the course despite contrasting styles.“Our games are pretty opposite,” the elder Fitzpatrick said. “I’m a good driver, he’s a good iron player. He’s a good short game and I’m a good putter.“He wants to do as well as he can, of course he does, but for me his path is probably going to be a little bit different than mine. The golf world is very different from when I started to when he’s playing now so he’s going to focus on the Challenge Tour probably, he’s excited for that.“Hopefully, he can follow in my footsteps.”They will be some tough footsteps to follow.Triumph at the RBC Heritage on Sunday, sealed with a dramatic playoff win over three-time major champion Jordan Spieth, penned the latest glorious chapter in what has been an outstanding few years for Fitzpatrick.The fact that the victory came at Hilton Head, a long-time holiday destination for the family from Sheffield, made it even more special, as the 28-year-old realized a childhood dream of lifting silverware on the Harbour Town course.“Moments like that, you wish time travel was real and you could go back and say, ‘This is what’s going happen in a few years,’” he said.“I would have been amazed, it was always one that I wanted to win and it was very special to do it.”And as if winning couldn’t have been any sweeter, it arrived in the face of overwhelmingly one-sided crowd support for home hero Spieth, with ‘U-S-A’ chants soundtracking much of the deciding playoff holes.Spieth gestured to fans for quiet, but Fitzpatrick relished his leading role as a villain.“It was great … I definitely enjoyed being in it,” he said.“I wouldn’t say I’ve played in that atmosphere too often, but it’s certainly nice to perform under that pressure and I think that’s what made it mean so much as well.”Fitzpatrick is looking forward to a role reversal of crowd bias when Italy hosts the Ryder Cup for the first time in September.Rome’s Marco Simone Golf and Country Club will be the stage for what Team Europe hopes will be a decisive rebound after a bruising defeat at the hands of their American rivals at Whistling Straits in 2021.Fitzpatrick, a member of that team and the similarly defeated 2016 roster, is yet to win a singles match at the biennial tournament but would touch down in Rome a far more accomplished player should he be selected.“I’d really like to be one of the top players that week and play really well,” he said.“I’m just excited for that opportunity and I think that’s what’s really important is to first make the team, and then look forward to it, enjoy it, and go out there and try to win some points for Europe.”His other main aim for 2023 is to add another major to his trophy cabinet, no easy feat with the caliber of names chasing the same goal.A tied-10th finish at The Masters signaled a strong start to the major season for the Englishman, who finished eight strokes adrift of dominant winner Jon Rahm.The Spaniard’s second major title consolidated his reputation alongside Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy in the so-called ‘big-three’ atop the rankings. Yet Fitzpatrick – dubbed the hardest-working golfer on the PGA Tour – has no intention of accepting his place in the food chain.“I don’t wanna just sit back and be like, ‘They’re all too good for me and I’m just happy with where I am.’ That’s not me as a person,” Fitzpatrick said.“I’m constantly looking at ways to improve and get better, and that’s what’s really important is to keep pushing myself and try and catch them up.”",sport,0.0
